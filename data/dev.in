I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Like you care.
But you hate Joey
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Why?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom?  Kat has a date?
So they tell me...
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Get out!
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Will Bogey get bent?
Assail your ears for one night.
What's the worst?
Yeah
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
You and Verona?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
William didn't even go to high school
I didn't have a choice.
You're not a big talker, are you?
Okay?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
BIANCA
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Good call.
How?
Fallacy.
Is that right?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
So what I want doesn't matter?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Macbeth, right?
Kat a fan, too?
What plan?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
What's to discuss?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Father...
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Colon!
I suppose we're both old men now.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Thank you.
The land is there.  I know it!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
No.  No way.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
I can't take you to my place.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
No!  Nothing happened.
But Chief?  Over this??
What was that, Korfin?
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Describe him.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
I'll come with you.
This isn't homicide school.
You got any better ideas?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Yeah.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Then do it, asshole.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Answer the phone.
Answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Okay, til tonight.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Hi, I'm Honey.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Did you hear what I said?
What?
Speak English!
What is it?
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Yes, the money is good.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
How did you start the fire this time?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
It's about my salary cheques.
Really.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Well, that's something.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, it is, Hal.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
CONINUED
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Hey, what about me?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
I hear you've got visitors.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
What do you think?
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
I don't give out the details.
Well?
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Why?
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Do I get to kiss her too?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Doesn't look like it.
Hey, you're right.
I guess he got the message...
Hey, you know what I really think?
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Hi, it's me...
Whaddya think?
Hard man to live with.
Shut up.
Keep stallin'.
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
He's a she!
So you do know her.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
What is?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
...What's your name?
When EVIL returns so shall we.
6... 5...
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Here we go again...
Actually only one cell survived..
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
I want your best man on this!
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I know.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You should have.
Anything harder?
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you...
That's five thousand dollars.
And they are?
Friend of yours?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
I want his name.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Don't think I won't.
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
Look, you cocksucker...
You are a private investigator?
Enlighten me.
Pardon me?
Truman Capote.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
How much do you make now?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
You've found missing persons before.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Yes.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
What?
Do you think the police did a good job?
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Rick...I can't.
You in a hurry?
You've been up all night?
How long have you been awake?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
What?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Hey...wake up.
Where is he?
But how...?
About him?
Since my little girl became a mom...
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
What?
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
But I've seen her grave.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
So they caught up with you, too?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Anything ---
Under <u>water</u>?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
All ready?
Who with?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
I used to play ball.
Double A. New Britain.
Yeah.
Don't mind if I do.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
On your sleeve.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
What then?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Are we going in this?
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
I'm not saying that.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I'm fine, fine.
On what you pay me?
So?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
I still don't understand --
You okay?
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Then... I guess you have to.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Of course! I would've heard.
When did she die?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
The other guy.
In the living room.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
We don't know that.
I prefered the terrorists.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
Why?
Who did this?
Stand by.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Can't it wait?
You know what?
Flying the plane.
One.
But...
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
I was reading too.
What are you doing, Ted?
Elaine.
You mean...
Now!
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
I'm so excited, Simon.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Sure.
You folks need any help?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
You can't go in there!
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
George Zipp said that?
Well...not for another two hours.
That's right.
A hospital? What is it?
Elaine!
Ted!
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
You are Cassandra?
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Nothing?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Screw you.
You know that guy?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
How potent?
Position?
Yes.  That follows.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
And it's too late to shut it down?
What?
HOW MUCH TIME?
Ripley...
No.  There's no way!
If I go.
That the atmosphere processor?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Let's go!  Let's go!
They're in the approach corridor.
What's this?
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
They're dead.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Burke!  Open the door!
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
I knew you'd come.
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
A brothel.
What does he look like?
What?
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
And how will you make him keep it?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
What's the matter with you?
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
It is miraculous.
Why you?
He needs me, ma'am.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
He's doing his best.
Be careful!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Really?
Yes?
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Why are you here?
Do you always live like this?
How many?
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
I'm sorry. No.
Love, Sire!
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
Did my work please you?
A Mass for the dead.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
Where did I stop?
Strange!
And that's all?
Oh? Have I seen it?
What is what?
Who is on this committee?
Mozart -
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
What? Who the devil are you?
Who is she?
Bene.
What happened to them?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Surely you're not suggesting...
How is that?
Aw come on, Miss Price!
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
I'm a werewolf.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Closet.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
But, David.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
He all right?
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
I looked.
Has he been refusing food?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Where am I?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
It's a five-pointed star.
Right.
Did you hear that?
A coyote.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
See anything?
You really scared me, you shithead.
I'm going completely crazy.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Nurse!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
What about the zoo?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Yeah.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Fifty thousand dollars!
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
Why not?
know, but
Line?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Well, what?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Why, Cyril, you're insane
Now?
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Much better this morning, thank you.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Good morning, Helen.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
You're lying!
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Oh, Matt . . .
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
I guess so.
He's smiling.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
But if we take their money and supplies...
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
She had a moustache.
A bad idea.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Of St. Louis?
On account of we're robbing it.
My little Web did that?
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Such as?
Web's dead.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
You're doing just fine.
"Big and older"?
Don't care.
If I could go back to farming --
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
Oh yeah.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Sparkling rocks?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Was it worth it?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
There's only four of them...
Just perfect.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Can you put men at all four?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
That's nice.
I never knew you smoked.
Yes?
Really?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
But what about the past? Our past?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.
It's just not.
Maybe it's just the light.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'll do it.
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Anywhere you want?
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Paul Owen.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Understandable.  Lime?
How well did you know him?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Hmmm.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
What?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Don.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Well, I could he wrong.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I'm so hungry.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Yes, Owen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You are a fanatic.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
Nothing.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
You look beautiful.
Here we go.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
You're living here?
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
You could've handwritten it.
You do?
Just thought his work should go on.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Cool!
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Bring it to the other location.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
To my health.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
We know all that, Exposition.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Why not? It's a question.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
He's too well-protected right now.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Really, Austin!
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Lay it on me.
Don't mind if I do.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Noooooooooooooo!
Shut up.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
He's asleep.
I'm proud of you.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
... love...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Promised? Who promised?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Hmmm ...
What are you trying to do to me?
To find out who killed my husband.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Whereas you are.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
That's what we were working on.
Is that what you think?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
You lied.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
No idea who. No idea why ...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Amnesia?
Anyone particular in mind?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
The last one you'll ever see.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
What do you mean?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Great car.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
I've tried to change her mind.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Huh? Wha...
I don't know... I just feel scared.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
That feels so great.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
A strange wang right in my palm.
That's it, prick lips.
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Hookers beat you up?
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
That's it.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
I'd love that.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Under the table!
My Debbie?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Wash it to the windows?
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
You gotta let me finish --
Just come down, John. Just --
It works.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
Goddamn it Stephen!
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Roll the hose.
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Everybody did.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
I know.
Jennifer.
You're back.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hi.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Homey.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Oh Jesus Christ...
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Stephen, what are you doing here?
He's going to be a fireman.
He treats you okay?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
He's out.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Inspector.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
You took the chalice.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
All right, cop. I want my money.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
Are you sure?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Ho!
Let's go niggers!
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
We're ready when you are.
What do I do?
What's that?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
I would like to change your name.
To what?
I won't do it anymore.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm wid it.
Go on.  Good so far.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Which one is your brother?
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Can I kiss you too?
So they can be on TV.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
It looks delicious.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Regardless, he still is your father.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Where are you from?
What do you mean?
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
I heard ya lady is wild.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Never read a book in my whole life.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Don't try to change to the subject.
What is the service, sir?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
I'll match any man with the sword.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
I have no luggage.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
Certain?
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
Why are you shaking?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
May I be quite frank with you?
Yes, of course.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
He is the only one unaccounted for.
It's... too slow.
I just don't like it.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
You did Basic here?
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
I'm not telling you what happened.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
What business?
Where?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
How do you know that?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Why?
Where have you been, Jay?
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Why?
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
He admitted it.
I didn't --
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
You knew Sergeant West?
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
I plan to grow on you.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
What?
Dunbar.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
Little bit.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
You couldn't have known --
Think it'll work?
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
He was your friend.
Poor fucker my ass...
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
Tell him to shut up --
Yeah.
You think he did it?
Sir, yes, sir!
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Or are you too scared?
I brought it.
What did she look like?
Yeah.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I'll...
Lucky girl.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
You were talking about your wedding.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You're not trying to run away?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
When did you ever work in an office?
Son?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
It's unbelievable.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
How did you know my father?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
But it's not true.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
We rented a car.
Of course.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
What for?
The sets were good.
What's this?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
Right.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
And...
What was that?
No. It is too judgmental.
You can stay tonight.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I do. I want to very badly.
What?
Oh Jesus.
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Lazarus?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Hi.
Hey.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Yeah.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
She's around. Always is.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
You gonna steal my truck?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Teh... Tehronne?
How long... how long I been out?
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
What do you want?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Want another?
Could you do somethin' for me?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Looks like you know a song.
I don't want you to let go.
Shit. Who hasn't?
Why you say that?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Holy shit!
I feel better. Do you?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
-- I should tear your head off.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Nick... You up?
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Nick!
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
Know her?
What's he saying?
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
A wife.  She left.
Louder, pal, louder.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
I need your help, Joyce.
Keep the change.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
Why me?
You're foreigners.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
I have to get to Sugai.
I want him.
Let's go while there is still time.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
He's not ready yet.
When?
I think, therefore I am.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Yeah.  I got it.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
And what in your estimation works?
Book the good ones for where?
It that mother real?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
I'd never get an abortion.
It would be my child.
Is there anything else?
How are you doing?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
Discreetly.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
How do you know I'm not?
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
What?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
You want to go home?
Whatcha doin'?
You look... better.
Just better.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
What?!
Where are we going?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Nope.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Wait!  Wait!
It's Perry!
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
My Mom and Dad.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
I told you I've never driven before!
Yes!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
The what?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
I'm leaving, too.
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I know first aid!
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
...I do.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Well, do we just go on up?!
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Who use to own it?
Why not? He has great pants.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
The recovery is very impressive.
Good-bye, Adam.
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
How old do I look?
How do you do, ma'am.
Right.
We have to go.
All back East.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Good god.
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
What's that noise?
The locks.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
No.  I think it's just right.
Let's eat our cake.
Would you excuse me?
In the generator room again?
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
We stay down here.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
He's smart.
Some time.
Alright, I will.
Well, what do you think?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
Oh, no!
Where?!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Yes.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Not yet.
Nobody.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Oh shit.
Don? Are you in with them?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
You like to open me, don't you?
I asked first.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Oh no.
Hello, baby.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Terrible boring.
That's too bad.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Okay, yeah, call.
You saw a lot in one night.
Did you see her undressed?
You want to go talk to him?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
NO.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
I need Il Duce.
There's ways around that.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Look under the body.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Where's your gun?
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
They got nothing.
We're here brother.
What?! What are you doin'?
Be careful.
Would someone please come over here and...
Fuck!
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Is that right, Rambo?
A bit.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Give the guy a shot.
It is your corrupt we claim.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Oh my god!
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Loop around real fast.
Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't want to use it.
I keep it for emergencies.
See if mine are in there.
I'll say it.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
As long as he gets out OK.
This was in fourth grade.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
We've got sixteen dollars.
Get out of the way.
OK. Mark that down.
As a person?
Take your second position.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Freeze!
Nobody move!
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
That was a test?
How does that feel?
Death.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Why'd you want to help us?
See you.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
No, I don't mind.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Uh-uh.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
No.
They are.
That never would of --
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I warned you, Dignan.
He electrocuted someone?
His name was Swifty?
What happened?
This is natural.
I told you they were there.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
Is he chasing us?
Bob. Are you coming?
My brother's in jail.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
You said 48 hours!
I'm sorry, Bob.
I couldn't hear anything.
Here we go.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
26 weeks.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Who? Applejack?
Where?
I don't know.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
And what are we looking for?
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
Sorry to wake you.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
-- car keys?
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
Sleep. Sleep now.
But we were so careful.
-- not yet --
See that tram coming around the corner?
Who is Pamela Landy?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
So when was I here?
You didn't answer my question.
Mr. Nevins?
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
If you say so.
Did you?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
The Bruce is not coming, William.
I rest.
How many?
Test of manhood.
No. He did not.
I do not confess.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Then when?
It's battle I want, not talk.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
What is it?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
And the bad news?
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I just thought you should know.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
What the hell are you doing?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Here you go, buddy.
How long have you been married?
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
It's not for sale.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Do you know where they are?
Occupied France?
We said "no questions."
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
And I was wondering.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
My German's a little rusty.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
And I said I would never leave you.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
You are very kind.
Apparently he has the letters.
-- Yes?
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Hello, Rick.
We'll come again.
Go ahead.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Everything in order?
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
No, Captain, please.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Mademoiselle.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Is that a serious offer?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Get me the Radio Tower!
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
Rick! Rick, help me!
Just a little something of my own.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
Save some for tomorrow.
Can't.  Need water.
They're on autopilot.
What's so damn funny?
Possible.  So you did those wings?
What brings you out to the sticks?
Four four.  A record.
Could you watch Jango?
That's your dog.
You too.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
For the third time.
Hello?
I need to do it.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Better than I can!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I've never seen a lobster.
So. Not bored yet?
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
What's the *medical* explanation?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
I *know* this was right.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I thought they might take me.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
A B-24 Liberator.
They're migrants.
So. What should I do now?
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I am not a doctor.
Uh... sure.
You're not yet three months, are you?
But you don't look very happy.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Then it's malaria?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
This has to happen fast.
Keeping the Fix happy.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Nice.
She had you tempting fate.
We were back on.
Mob?
How much we going after?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
You'll be there?
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Come on. Harder.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
How do you know I will?
Miles...
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Uh...
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
Escorts!
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
Of what? They're both crooks.
My fucking heart bleeds.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
In over your head?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Special Agent?
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I despise the job.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I'm working on that soccer story.
Good night?
And your lady?
I've got something to tell you.
Are you trying to read my palm?
I don't like it.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Gambling's not about money.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
The debts.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
How much do you owe?
What for?
Hello...
How are you?
Ross.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
How long have you worked at the casino?
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
You want me to check?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
Key?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Armed.
Huh?
Snap out of it, bomb.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
That's it.
Why don't you have more time?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Hmmm...
I have no proof that it was false data.
Doolittle...
In a second.
What are you gonna name it?
-- automatic channels open --
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Yeah?
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Sir?
Yeah.
No wire.
That's not why we're here.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
She was there...
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
A grand.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
Damn... Are you alright?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Thank God.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Sorry about your window.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
So what are you gonna do about it?
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Is the social studies class over for today?
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Bent?
You need to get out more.
How well do you remember the lab?
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
A girl.
What's in it for you?
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Well, not me personally.
You don't want to.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Who are you?
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Oh?
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
A fog bank.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Thanks, miss.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
You love him?
Pick a song, Hawk.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
No... You don't think...?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
What's gone?
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Ahh, sunshine.
Yeah.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Gimme your gun, boy!
Is that your final answer?
Yeah, you did!
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
I want to show you something.
You have a request?
Hey...
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
You mean soap?
Wonder where we'll be then.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Who?
Hey.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Would you like to talk about this friend?
I think about girls a lot.
A sign from whom?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
You've done it again?
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
She's alive, sweetie.
This came for you, sweetie.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Here, I didn't get any.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Loretta, shut it.
We was robbed.
Wisconsin.
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
So help me, Gladys.
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
I will if you shut your piehole.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Who to?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
He only weighs ten ounces --
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
It must be done right away.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
I've always thought that myself.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Has the response picked up?
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
You've never been?
Have you read it?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Is he... dying then?
Of course! You want out?
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The main spire.
John Merrick.
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Not at all, John.
You want a dressing bag, John?
My home.
Yes, very soon.
Yes John?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Fine.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes. John wants it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Well...
Are you the proprietor?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
What are what?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
It was different...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
But you don't realize....
The second note.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
How?
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
But...
Halfdan the Black's here!
What's it all about?
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
It's magic.
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
You'll be sucked down too!
Just say something cheerful.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I AM one, Dad!
Bye... sorry...
How did he do that?
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
It's a tradition.
But it's a responsibility...
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
I'm so excited. Yay!
How are you today?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Probably see you at the book store.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Sort of, um...
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Take care.
Um --
Very much.
Well, I should probably get going.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Thanks.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Okay.
Yeah.
Let me drive you home.
I want to have a baby.
You're drunk.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Really? Is he cute?
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Happy Birthday.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Do you remember what we talked about?
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Probably.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
It's dark.
So go.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I probably got the same thing as you.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I just got in.
Clementine.
So then she just stops calling.
How's the chicken?
She's so sexy.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Well... I did.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
I hope you get your work done.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Oh! Great. That's great!
We'll speak soon.
See you later, alligator.
Yes?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We can't do this.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
He went home sick.
The voltage looks fine.
It's an apartment.
Is everything getting worse?
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
Extraordinary!
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Thanks.
A job for me?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
I don't know anything about it.
Time to play Spam in the can.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
His peritoneum has ruptured...
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Alive?
Peters...
That's a negative, Starck.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Captain Miller...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
That's an affirmative.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
I'm on my way, Starck.
...repeat, we're armed...
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Get them back --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
What is it?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben. Are you okay?
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Now what is up with that?
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
That's good. That's uh... good.
What? What do you mean you --
Are you kidding?
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Raising the shields.
You said it was urgent.
Oh, I think you already have.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
No. I want my money back right now.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
They're not home yet.
I'm just guessing.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Are you still a virgin?
Leave me alone.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
What? Are you all right?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Take that back.
We've got to get an abortion?
No. It's too soon.
Hey, Rat.
Yeah?
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Not if you're over sixteen.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Who's that?
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Seen the new Playboy?
What the fuck is this guy doing?
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
It was nice.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
What do you want?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I don't know. I guess so.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
If you graduate.
The point sounds fine.
I think I better take you home.
What about those other guys you live with?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Do you really have to go?
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Rum and ice, please.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Where's the medicine?
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
Read the newspapers.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Extract of pineal!
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
I don't think you should...
I think I know where a CB is.
They're right here.
We just smeared a skunk.
We gotta try.
How are you holding up?
He only shot you once.
How many?
Bullshit.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
What?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
What?!
Shit!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Did we make it?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
I'm not!
Madam...?
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
You don't think I'm good enough?
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Showdown.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
I know you believe that.
...Don't you?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
You sound as if you hate it.
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Okay then...
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
How'd I look?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
What?
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Calm down, Frances.
Frances...
What's left of my blood.
I took the early rounds.
I should've known...
What?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Frances, You're crazy.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Why do you say that?
Shit!
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
What?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
That's me, Clifford.
But they're using you!
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
Then why did you bring them?
Where are you going?
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
But what -- 
Please sit down...
I see.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Yes.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
A brain. Extremities.
You will honor your promise to me!
It's been months. It's not like him.
Is he not back yet?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
You make me weak.
Your decision. For us.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
So do I.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Are you having me on?
How much longer?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Victor, explain yourself.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
Re-configure the leads?
Ah. An explorer.
We should go now.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
What'll you do when you leave here?
I'll go take a look.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
You don't believe in suicide.
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
How'd she die?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
I promise.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I'm going for 'em!
Mexico.
You're gonna let us go?
Are you okay?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
See ya.
Not even for lunch?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Were you giving that pig signals?
Start the car.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Sight seein'.
Yes.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
This ain't the time.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What?
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
I'm fine, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir, WHAT?
I'm not sure what --
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Fine by me, sir!
Did you hear?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Me?  Why me?
What?
Which is guy-speak for...
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
And how do you know that?
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Just askin'
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
You never said it was off the record.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
You'd be surprised.
Not for a long time, now.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Do I know you?
Oh.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
"The show must go on."
Nothing.
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
You could order something in.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Covalent... Right. So...
How do you remember this stuff?
It's suicide.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
It's... I don't know.
Not a clue. You?
What?
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
That's it, It's go time.
You should have let me hit him.
I heard it too.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Simpler.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Home.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Excuse me?
What kind of signal?
Oh, right, sorry.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
Hold course, Laredo!
Over three hundred miles.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
The army can survive without me.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Wil...
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
The British army, sir!
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
These supplies...?
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
Martha... what?
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
You're out of your mind!
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
I say!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
You see the paper?
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Who?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
Your who?
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
You know how to write one of these?
What money?
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
What?
You say look at you?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Sovereign.
You're an investor, is that it?
Leo spanked a waitress?
What've you got?
Keep going.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I believe it.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I want to know.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Yeah?
You thought I was faking?
Why not?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
I don't know.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
You seem to feel fine about it.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
That's what it says.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Maureen.
What?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the fuck -- ?
Yeah.
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Don't fall asleep.
Then why didn't they take it.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
The guy. He just came this way.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Got your light?
But where's the damage?
The what?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Epps, over.
Over the gold.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I heard that.
What now?
Greer?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
You don't remember?
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Who?
Who?
YES.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
About what?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi.
Why?
When did I say I hated you?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Look, that's back when I hated you.
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
You're better at it.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Let's go hassle Josh.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
What? Where?!
I don't believe you.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Like what?
You're just jealous.
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Do you want to do something tonight?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Hello?
When was this?
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
May I ask what you're doing?
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
How much is this?
Seymour does.
Punk rock is over!
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
I did too!
Well why do I care about that?
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Good luck...
Yeah, well...
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What, are you a klansman or something?
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Oh, hi...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
On that pathetic fake blind date.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
I am a man of peace.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
Might be exciting for you.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
You mean nobody died?
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Think about something else.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
For you.
Good news?
You like him, don't you?
He has children?
Where is it?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Where do you go next?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Does she know anything about babies?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
-- the sorrow --
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
Is the line sinking?
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
What?  Yeah.
Are you telling me how to drive?
And pure --
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Ummm -- figure eight?
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I want to help you.
Don't scream.
You heard it?
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
Really!  Is it gone?
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
What's that got to do with it?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Die in what sense?
I don't believe in luck.
In a storage facility.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
What on earth gave you that idea?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Something was definitely here.
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Does she want to be?
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
What is it?
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
How do you know?
Mmmhmmm.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
That's what you told me two days ago!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
I want that bastard dead!
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
So I understand.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Who the hell are you?
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Then get a large cash advance.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Where are you meeting this person?
I've never been to it.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Here? In Berkeley?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Why?
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
But Elaine --
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
No.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
I am going to call the police now.
BENJAMIN?
What? No. Nothing.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What do you mean?
Yes?
I think I'll go to bed.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
How are you?
He didn't see me.
Do you want to get it now?
That's fine.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes.
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Well what do you want to talk about?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
You're not interested in art?
What one.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
About five years.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Don't talk about Elaine.
I have my reasons.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I see.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
If that's how you feel --
May I stay then?
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Mrs. Robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Sure.
Why did you say that?
No.
-- worried?
You'll never be young again.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Oh yes.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
But why?
That's quite a statement.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Is anything wrong?
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Why?
Have you seen it?
What?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Am I quite strange to you?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Grusinskaya --
Yes.
I'll go -- good-bye.
When are you leaving Berlin?
For Vienna?
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
The Baron is tired?
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
Is that too much, Baron?
No -- not at all.
I take five hundred.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Be quiet.
Any letters?
Send his bags up to my room.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You're trembling.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
I must go to England -- at once.
I understand perfectly.
Can you pay some attention to me?
Baron!
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
I know you did -- I said you did --
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Take them back, Suzette.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Me?
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
Four minutes past. Please come.
No. No word.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
What you need is some relaxation.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
I want to keep my teeth.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You're calling the shots.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Here you are! Two rich people!
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
But they must be! They cut glass!
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
What? Me?
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
I tripped over a chair.
Why?
Expecting visitors?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
You must have some money.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
That's right.
I can't. I just left home.
Where's the five?
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
He retired.
Open your door.
You -- I don't know.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
What is it? What's going on?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Gun?
Yes, I know, I know.
Mr. Simms.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Where?
Detective...
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
It's Amy Kramer.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Another historical inaccuracy.
My office?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Now you're joking, right?
Yes.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
I'm okay.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Can't you hold it?
You aced it, didn't you?
Better her than me.
You're so easy...
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
You've been watching too much TV.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But surely Rogers isn't --
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
I dunno, boy.
You know what gets me?
No.
Um.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Months?
Excuse me.
Go to the funeral?
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
We got to get another pilot.
You invited me.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Ask it!
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
College!
What's good about that?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Dad was never in England?
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
I don't know.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Will you go to bed?
What kind of exercise?
No.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
Not at all.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
Disease?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Turn around?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
If he wants to go.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
No.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Ooops.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
I've never heard of it.
What for?
Poison.
My violin is avenged!
I'm utterly satisfied.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
That goes double for me.
I don't want to live any more.
Still lives with his mother.
I was afraid to ask.
Who have you been talking to?
No.
That man is your father.
It's fine!
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
He'd assume we had.
Yes?
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I see.
Did you see him?
Yeah.
Is he coming home?
I'm sorry.
You're saying no.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
It's suicide!
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Paul's only twelve years old.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
You're still dressed?
That's cool.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
No.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
When do we start?
What rate?
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Tijuana.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
She left you right?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
Who's paying you?
Mast?
What have you found out?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
They are?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
But this is my apartment.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Where'd you hear that name?
Jake?
Wes, do me a favor.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
I don't know.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
What?
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Come again.
Could I see your registration?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
And what do you do, my dear?
Eh, no.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
All right.
How about some ginger pie?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
That's a nice teapot.
What were you fighting for?
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
Where's that?
Oh, you weren't scared.
I'm getting married.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Oh, is this your father?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
No.
Your classmates?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Eh?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Parasite!
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
He... he loved me.
God, that's terrible.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
Is he serious??
They were over here, Professor.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
See? I don't like that --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Reliquary --
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
You call that thing a cigar??
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Where do you --
Anything else you --
What's the problem?
Will you sign for the bed?
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
You did this before, right?
Frank --
Hurting.
Who?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
Hell...
Who did?
Don't you care?
What's the problem?
Take it slowly.
Maybe a brandy.
Are you all right?
Huh?
Plain soda?
You want something to drink?
Why don't you do the same?
What's wrong?
What happened to me?
You wouldn't believe me.
Who's there?
I love you, honey.
I guess.
He's gone.
No you don't.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
You're not going?
You know I do know the way home.
I see.
I've been better.
Really.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Nice, Barry.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
I wanna date a musician...
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
How do you know about that?
None.  Christ!
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
We work there!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Are you all right?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
But don't you remember?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I suppose so.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Nevermind.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Sure they are.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
No, no.  When are you going home?
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
More confident, maybe.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
Would you marry me if I was?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
It's a crematorium.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Sixty.
Sure.  Ten cents.
I warned you.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
I've been to Church Hill.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
What about me?
Have you gone to the police?
He sees me as a threat.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
Maybe it would do us both good.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Who are you?
He is older than I.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Get out.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
Be quiet.
How can you know this?
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
I don't understand.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
You will live.  Survive.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Why?
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
I have no future husband.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
What would you like?
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Not so scared.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
He found us even there.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You've been here from the start.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
Are you here?
This your present address?
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
I presume it's a sword.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
The poem?... The poem was great!
Seventy-five.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
I'm sure you haven't any.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Oh, she was here.
Where'd she go?
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Mr. Burns --
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Oh.
No. My mother.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Done what?
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
No, I can't.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
No!
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Afraid? I should say not!
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Yes. Where is he?
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
What tickets?
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
I'm finished.
Where is she? Tell me!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Is this the Community Hospital?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Walter!
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Open up there, will you!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
He's harmless.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
No -- don't out me off.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Got you, Williams!
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Any news?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Mother!
Mother!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Don't forget about production for use.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The what?
That was a googly!
No, she didn't.
I know a secret.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
But Dad, It's the News.
I don't know?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
What's that?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
It seems to have survived.
Really, that's a long time.
Huh... what cone?
Tiny's home.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
What about the tree?
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
How much further?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
How long have you been running this place?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Yeah.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Check this out.
Quiet.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
God damn.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Firefly.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Huh?
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Where's Bill?
Where is he?
Hey.
Tell it to my daughter.
Mr. Willis?
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
I guess not.
Say my name.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Hmmmph.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
No!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I want our boy back.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Won't he be able to tell?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Oh?
Three foot one.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
My God! The fork! The fork!
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
Come on.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
What are you doing in there?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Unn.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Boys just passing through?
Pittsburgh?
You want a chaser?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You know what's good for him?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
How much do I owe you?
Yeah? Why?
What is?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
I been thinking.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I got time, Bert.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Why?
It's quiet.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Go to hell.
Is this all we got left?
A son.
Yeah, that's what I think.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
You're a pretty good player.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
You better not miss, friend.
What time does the bus leave?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
So why go to college?
I drink.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
I've got something in my bag.
Give it to me.
No. You?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
What do you want to tell me?
Fifty-seven.
Well, what's the matter?
Is that a fact?
That's right.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
We're going to be moving, son.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
We were having a little talk.
Mr. Gardner, I --
But it's not, Jimmy.
They'll get us.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
I take it you've heard.
Are you all right?
What the hell is that?
Pops, you're a genius!
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Where are they?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
How're we doing?
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
Be careful.
Yes, I am.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Call them back.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Yes?
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
The Ark of the Covenant.
The Grail Diary.
At least I let you tag along.
You came back for the book? Why?
No, Dad. You listen to me --
How did you she was a Nazi?
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
What???
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
Well... I can't think of anything.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
But, Indy --
What?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
I ride with you, Indy?
What you look at, Indy?
No.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
Siam.
You all right?
What do you mean -- how?
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Just one arm!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
He's afraid of something.
Primitive sexual practices?
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
A fulcrum release lever!
Indy? Did you talk to them?
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
I get it!
Where are you,...Al?
Yes?
What is your name?
Why don't we go home?
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
What for?
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Did you hear that?
I don't like the sound of that.
Go out, take your first left.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
We get on a plane.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
You'll be me.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
What is it?
What's happening?
Rene...
But what's it look like?
What did that cost?
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
What is it, your charm?
You shut down your sensors.
Osaka?
I've got an idea.
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
I have been... I think you're right.
She works for them.
JOE What abilities...?
Not that truth!
Sorry...
What is your name?
I didn't do anything.
Impossible.
How about a deal?
We met on the beach.
It's just money.
And how do you service foreigners.
You may not remember things.
What things?
When you do...
Right.
Well...
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
Not you. Them.
Not...complaining, actually.
Then who did?
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
Do what?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
Who do you work for?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Your friends, did they ask about me?
He didn't.
One chip?
Then why are you smiling like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
What's Gruner like?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Do something!
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
It's alright.
Mom...what are you doing here?
It'l be alright.
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
What? Forget it.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Alright, alright.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Okay. 
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Hi, baby.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Is there any more rice...?
Soy sauce...
Why? Who said?
Who's calling?
What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
Alright.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
It would be better if he called us.
Alright?
What do you mean?
What?
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
Yeah, that's right.
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Seven dwarfs?
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Hello. You there
What did you get us?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Yes.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Lowell, I can't afford --
She sued you for back payments of child support?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Most certainly.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object!
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
What a touching story.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
You want Botox?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
My God.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
What is your husband's profession?
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
No.
You don't believe in it.
Howard is a beautiful person.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Hmmm...
She never particularly cared for me.
Your mother was.
No.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Did you just propose to me?
No.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I don't have a ring!
I know.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Honey, I could sit...
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
What do you want?
STUFF.  Got a light?
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
No buts. Now. Out.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
So. Now what?
Who's she?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I am very sorry.
No. You're not.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Wrigley?
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
How is she?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
You were taken for a buggy ride?
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You ought to know why. Because
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Why should she? After all
What would you like to have me do?
Yes, sir.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
I don't want it reported!
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I found it on the seat.
Here, boy!
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Thanks, professor.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
I better go over and see her.
Not as long as I'm alive.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
Well, take them off.
What!
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Carrots.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Eat a carrot.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
What'd you give him for the car?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Not interested. 
When does the bus leave?
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
SorryI didn't mean to
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
I'm hungry.
The dame's too smart for him.
Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Collect?
See that. They're gone!
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Whyno
Yeah. Just babies.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
You know you keep saying that.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
...give me protection?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
A Willie O'Keefe?
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Did they live?
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
What's wrong, Lou?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Between six and seven seconds.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
How many men are working with you on this?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
This looks pretty good on me.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
You were there for me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Can I have a word with you?
What's this?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
I gave you my card there.
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
I didn't?
With ten thousand? Nine.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Uh-huh.
He told me last night.
He came by.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's different with men.
What'd ya see?
You don't actually do it that way?
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
That's my job.
And is that it?
What if he checks it?
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
In a dress.
He's liable to shoot you.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
I hesitated taking that much.
That's Ordell's.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Spain.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
You know what we want.
He sells guns.
What for?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
Killian's.
What were you two fighting about?
You already knew that?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
It looks good on you.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
Yeah?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
What'd you care?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Want a hit?
Four years?
I thought you were sixteen.
I don't like dancing.
Please.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
What do I do?
Sure.
What's your relationship?
Yep.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Uh-huh.
Then what?
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
I can see that. Why?
Somebody already did.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
What does she do for you?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
What's up with this shit.
I thought you might be asleep.
I'm alone.
How'd you find me?
And you did that to protect my interest?
This place stinks.
Where do you want to go?
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
It was the window.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
But the paper ...
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
What can I tell you?
Her knee acting up?
I can't relax.
What are you doing?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Ah!
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
No.  I see them.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Hell, you think I am?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
I'm not cold.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Who did?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
Where are you?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
I don't know.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
He's coming right over.
Are we in Brooklyn?
Why didn't you call me?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Where are they?
Where have they gone?
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Sit down, Jake.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
One drop?
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
He's burning up.
He's burning up.
Paul Gruneger!
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's wrong?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
You've seen them?
Bring it in.
Yes it does.
We're not leaving Crutch!
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Where have you been?!!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Then what do we do?!
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
My job.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Where is he?
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
You wanna release your air tanks?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Did you like it?
Old woman?
Well?
They'll make it.
You must shut down the engines.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
You killed him?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
I missed you too.
What?!!
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
What have you done?
You got it.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
He's comin' up -- !
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Don't forget these.
Where is he?
It's three feet deep, Martin
Can you do that?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
...Nothing.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
What's that, a ship?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Just keep kicking.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
We're not even sure what it was.
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Yep.
Well... is everything all right?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
What's that supposed to prove?
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
I'm okay...
Follow him!
You know how I feel about her.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
What's up?
Really? What are they like?
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Can we make out now?
Yup.
What is your job title, exactly?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
Yeah.
Commercials.
Cold feet.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
No.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Hi Dad.
Yeah, like people in love.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Keith's hot.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
You guys are playing music?
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
It's a loft.
You lose!
Adele for god sake please lis...
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
You dropped this.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
I'm cool.
No it is not!
Adele... are you serious?
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Vernon, Florida.
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
If you say so.
So tell me... what happened here?
...I do.
...just like that?
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Who said he's my good buddy?
How do you know that?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Any word from that gallery?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
Where's Adele?
You were plenty hot.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
What happened?
Could be.
...Diebold?
How old you?
Yes!
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
She can fuck?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
What for? That guys a dick.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Can you do it man?
Yep.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I hate this game.
Man, this guy is really good.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Darcy?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Nah.
Right here.
Na.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Sup. Sup.
Hey.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
You were?
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Why is that?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Yeah.
Miss, would I be prying?
Are you in trouble with the law?
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
I hate sucking dick!
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
You think so?
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
You want a wip-it?
So, how many people live here now?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
You are!  I don't like you.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You still having a problem with this?
What is it?
Why does he call Sanderson?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Where is she?
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
What?
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
The police haven't told you?
By that time the game will be over.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
Nope.  Nothing.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
What scars?
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
I just can't believe it.
Why did he what?
How long has she been dead?
What about prints?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Did you see his face?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
He knows you're aware of that.
It's a good play, but risky.
We got a problem?
I can check and call you back.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Do you?
I'm just curious.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
What is this?
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
What?
Why not?
It could be anything.
Frank told me.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Thank you, but I can wait.
You have not slept in two days.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
The Beast will kill her.
I chose the wrong passage.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
You!
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Would you desert your friends?
It's a lie!
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
It is important to assure the succession.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
A fine match.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Modred! Impossible!
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Why must you know?
I cannot stop the sand.
No.
...You moved too, didn't you?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Take...
Well, I don't need them...
130... 140...
The yellow and pink.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
Why?
Stop. Everyone is looking.
Mathilda?!
Where are you going?
A little...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
...Don't you drink?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
How are you, Miss?
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh, that's good!
You can't sit here like that.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Do you recognize him?
I have new dreams now.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
Nothing's going to happen.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
How long does this... Mania last?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Thank you.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
You have?
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Why?
Most certainly.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Not our problem.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
This guy's not a murderer.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
You're amazing.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Are they standing?
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Mind if I use the bathroom?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
This is the home of an angel.
Thank you. What time is it?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Oh, and what did you do?
Please!
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Don't hit me.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
No. I was in the shower.
How many, would you say?
Because they got wet.
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Did you get it?
You're hitting on me?
You can't even imagine.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
You ready?
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
I'm so happy for you!
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Our group is full.
The idiot speaks.
What?
Yes, you are.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Your scrunchie?
Josh proposed!
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
But maybe it's not what you think.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
So?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Almost.
Neither.
It's pink.
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
You're beautiful.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Thank you. Having fun?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Grotesque... monstrous...
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
You... you're a beast!
Like some vile toadstool.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
You're a beast!
Or looked so beautiful...
Cathay?
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
The princess is dead.
Shhhh!
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Blackheart?
My God!  Look!
God's blessing.
Is she... dead?
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Mean you to seek him out below?
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Will you explain what's going on?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
I may have said perhaps...
Stop complaining.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
No!  I won't let it happen...
You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Sunlight?
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Everywhere!  Ow!
I can't see a thing.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Be fair, Oona.
What's she doing?
Praise be to God.
How came you by this blade?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Is he a friend, then?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
I put him to work.
You'd better call and cancel.
He seems lonely.
No.
Did you feel anything?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Where's your dad?
I don't want you to!
What's the point of this?
I don't wanna go.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
A violation?
He buys and sells the world.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
I've been here twenty years.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Thank you.
I forgot where I put my keys.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You don't have a choice.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
You'll have money when you work.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
When are you going to be back?
Where is it?
Sit down for a second.
What are you now?
What would you be doing now?
Getting high, I guess.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I still don't know what that means.
Good for you.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
God, you look like crap, George.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
Oh.  Sorry.
Because Dad left?
Lock the door behind you.
He never answers.
Kurt's been feeding him.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
It makes me sad.
What?
Where's Sam?
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
Going on?
Is your back still killing you?
No.  Mostly me.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
I was talking about our marriage.
Despite you.
Do it now!
The door was open.
Is Mae Rose okay?
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Sure I do. What's your name again?
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Reward?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
What ain't there?
Winston. His name's Winston.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
No.
You drew this?!
I know people.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Is everyone here?
Lemonade?
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Me? Willie Long.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
And give you a good buzz.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
This is baloney!
I mean... tough break.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Easy, Liberace.
Which way did he go?
Come on. One more time.
You keep a bat under your seat?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
"Octopus people?"
Valerie?
I think I'm floating.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
Don't do it.
Nicky!
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
You callin' me a thief, my man?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
That's better.  How do you want us?
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
I'm very smart.
What's wrong, Available?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
K.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
Of course --
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
He's good, isn't he?
They won't listen.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
What's that?
Of course.
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
What does that water do?
What people?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
They're comin' with us.
You okay, man?
What do you mean by that?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Hello.
Okay...
Pete?
Me, too.
He'll kill us.
Set.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Andy, who is that guy?
I don't. I don't know him.
Yeah.
His physical condition.
That's it.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
So?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
At sixty?
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Okay.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
You want some company?
What do you want?
Hey... Sheila.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Yes, sir.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
buy and sell?
Who?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No porters here!!
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
How can we get in touch with them?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
What is it?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
Yes.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
That was easy. I read your books.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
I was just going to.
Why, he's speaking English.
How about you? Do you want to go?
You'll wait till you rot!
EXCUSE ME
The hell happened?
What the hell...
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Actually, sir--
Right.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
She didn't even know you. .
What?
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Now what?
Looks like a train ticket.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
Since how long?
You were saying?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Yeah, Kay?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
How's Dee?
Kay?  What's your 20?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
-- but he didn't.
Yeah --
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
What?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
We can't grab it...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Go ahead.
Did he close the front door?
Any ID on the shooter yet?
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
You set me up...
Are you reading my mind right now?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Rufus, play it back...
You gotta have faith, Dad.
You're alive?
Sean --
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
But you have to.  They said you would.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
What about the picture --
Kill me!
What's so funny?
You're talking about the precogs...
You want to bring it down.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Congratulations, sir.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
What?
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
What about your meeting?
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
What was it then?
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What does he want with a precog?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
What if I gave you forty?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Is he cute?
Should I fuck him?
What the fuck was that about?
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Oh my god. What happened?
Oh, please.
Yeah? You sure?
I never promised you anything.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Whu --
But what about them?
I -- I -- I... Don't...
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
5-5-1.
What's up? Jess ready?
Yeah.
Get away from her.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
What's his name?
Where is this happening?
Heard of them.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Sure. Yeah.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
You want --
Take a few days --
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
I can wait around if you want.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I got no idea.
Ask if he said anything to her.
Sorry coach.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
What's the movie?
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
So they said more than the address.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
You happy?
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You got that right.
What the fuck's going on?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Did you hear what he just said?
It was six in the fucking morning.
Why?
Calm down.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
The line's over there.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Drinks are free, right?
'Strapped?'
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Coke?
Here they are, then.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
I'm working on it.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
What you talking?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
I see your point.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
Let's talk about you for a change.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
I can handle it.
It won't be easy.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Yes, sir, I did.
Can I ask you something?
"His greatest greatness."
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
How long has this been going on?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
Head nigger in charge?
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
What do you want?
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[Who's the boss?]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[How much do you want?]
[Yes. Many times.]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
You been working?
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Who's Emilio?
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
The blocks.
Still not a question.
Be a swimmer.
Dyslexic?
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Creasy... Wait.
[Yes.]
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
I think it's fantastic.
Creasy.
[Who's that?]
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Oh, yeah.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
I don't think I remember him.
What happen?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
When was this?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Who?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Please...
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Hello, Ma.
Marty...
Put on your blue suit...
So these two girls come over to the bar...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
You  must  open  me  up  again?
Wisconsin.
What?
You got directions?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
What's that?
The chest-cutter.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
We're a good team.
Frank...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
I think I heard about that.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
How did you get called that?
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
You mean who hit who?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
What's wrong with you?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.
What's that, Henry?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Action?
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Oh. Yeah.
Me?
Can I help you pack?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
All set, Ann?
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Looks all right
I got it all ready. Here.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Has he been here?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Where'd you play?
Hey, Boss.
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
The heelots!
St-rike!
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
I trust him.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Huh? Get what?
What's your name?
Yes! I was paid! But the
Did you write itor didn't you?
Nineteen!
What do you mean, too bad?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Not that we know of.
Dinner's on you.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
You want me to go up with you?
Who is it?
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
You signed out twice.
Hi, Roper.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
Why?
The 6 horse is last.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
You like this place?
...the hell are you talking about?
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
Prude.
Stay up there, Girl...
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
You let us worry about that.
What do you think would be in order?
And a car.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
You were right.
Who are you?!
The guests are here.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
New York.
You're jumping to conclusions.
A hotel?
What did he tell you?
Then you had her killed.
Then how do you know about --
-- You told me.
Why?
But you were with me.
Destination?
-- Standard.
Program name?
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Wow.  Sand.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
NEW POWER COINS!!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
That was a CHEAP shot!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
You own a hotel, sir?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Whatever you say, Boss.
Are you frightened?
I guess I am. Just a little.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Who hired the bastard?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
Inside, they were talking of you.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Who'll make the rules?
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Not stupid. Fat.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Jesus.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Olive or eyeball?
Stu Miley.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Why?
Holy shit.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Uh huh. And?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Sure. Why?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I don't think so.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
Mother!
What happened?
What does he do?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Shut up, Diz.
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Do we *have* to?
Where?
Huh?
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Henry Hill.
I did. What about it?
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Will the Senator yield?
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Y-yes.
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Hello, Jefferson.
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Did you say--bus?
Most natural thing in the world!
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Punch?
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
How?
What's that?
What?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
No.
You mean--here?
Go right ahead.
Why?
I also answer to whistles.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Well--I--
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Ax?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What do you mean? What's going on?
I know that.
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Maybe he won't get up.
His first 'whiff'!
Do I actually *see* this--?
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Are you married?
No, no children.
You fainted.
I enjoy it.
Yes.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Yeah, I know.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Uh-huh.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Yes, sir.
Gold, eh?
Oh, yes sir.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Entertainment?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Now, where were we?
Uh-huh.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Huh?
Well, I don't know. I
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
You came home last night - without them.
What two policemen?
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
But she's on the telephone
Why are they ganging up against me?
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
What an asshole!
Ernest, what do you think?
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
What?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
I do.
What do you want to know?
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Just who is here, can you tell me?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
I've offended you!
Sore throat?
Is that like a party trick?
And this is legitimate therapy?
That's one way to put it.
I don't follow you.
I guess you saw the show...?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You feel violated?
...but first, you have to tell me something...
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I've got three big ones.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Amazing.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Who else knows?
"Get to know your therapist."
At least you pulled yourself out...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
No... no training.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
And how does one do that?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
Goin' somewhere?
You shall see.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
You bastards!
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Two hundred pounds.
A bright good morning to all.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Can you swim?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
No you're not.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
What do you suppose killed him?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
We didn't think this through very well.
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Me, too.
Sounds good to me.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
That boy's got talent.
Are you an actress?
Who's the artist?
What?
Alone tonight?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
It is not dead. It is hiding.
What are you talking about?
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
So you're chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Roy --
What's that?
You guys going to a costume party?
Here you go. 
I use it... to fight evil.
Who are they?
This looks like a job for Superman --
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
And there's the Sphinx.
The who?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Oh no.
We've got lift off!
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
Who is there?
Bertrand, sire.
Read it back.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Yes, sir?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
No, they're living in Nice now.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
Thank you.
Thank you, Napoleon.
Good evening, sir.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
Only Lisette?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Are you trying to insult me?
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
Were you in love with him?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
That's all I can say.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes, I wrote it.
My God, what do you think?
You mean you heard them making love?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Fuck, what's his name?
I ain't trying to rob you...
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
What's the matter?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You make it sound so easy.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Excuse me?
That the big one, huh?
Today ain't my day.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Rancho Cucamonga?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Don't remind me.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Somebody close?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
That's...a comfort to hear.
Ah.
You were very nervous.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
Could I see some identification, sir?
What's your point?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
How am I supposed to get away?
Are you sure?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
No way.
Nods.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
What?
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I'm not a baby.
Why?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
I been mindin' Pearl.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
I'll light the lamp.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How do you mean?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Tricked us!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
John don't like him much.
There's something else.
What?
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
You better not sing that song.
She's gone to Moundsville.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
John?
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Tell me what, boy?
I don't know nothin'!
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
Sure, that's no secret.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Can I have my supper please?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
None of your business, Madam.
Pearl and John.
Miz Cooper!
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
Much better.
Who?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
You used me, daddy!
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Dead and gone.
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
He's nuts about you.
What the hell you doing here?
Jungle man fix Jane.
Good evening, Anna.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
About what?
Well, a hat...
Evening gown?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Or it might be the firing squad!
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Which lawyer?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Good morning, Your Highness.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
Eight forty-two, sir.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Yes, General Savitzky?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Let's do that.
Get out of here!
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
Yes, Comrade.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
...and Kopalski.
You want me to go in there?
What business?
Private.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
But you had!
Yes!
No visa.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Can I help you?
How long does it take a man to land?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Yes, it is.
Then you don't want me to go there.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
I don't like your following me.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
No.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
What, darling?
Not white, darling.
Let's turn on the radio.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
What does he say?
What did he say?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Good morning.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
The future of the common people.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
How much do you need?
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
To protect his people.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Yeah?
McCord? ...
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
What about England?
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
That's right ...
What's Liddy got?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Sir?
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
I can't ...
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
What'd he say?
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
What ... ?
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Yes.
The lie?
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
That'll be the day.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Sir?
It makes us human ...
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
I'll concede in the morning.
I want a divorce.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
Tomorrow.
And what am I doing?
Hiding what?
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Lost.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
You heard it?
In Angola. Yeah.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Nineteen zero and nine.
No money in his room there?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
None of that explains your man though.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
You ain't heard from him?
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir.
Yes Sheriff.
Don't get hurt.
Okay.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Llewelyn --
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Llewelyn?
What should I do?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I know where it's going to be.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
How'd you find it?
You know she won't be there.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
You already asked me that.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
You live in that house behind the store?
For what?
I didn't put nothin' up.
What do you want to know?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
That's me.
Then you'll like me.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
What product.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
You never gave us a chance...
Why do they keep calling you George?
Lyla's very nice.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Ad lib?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
David, please --
George...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
She called you 'George,' George.
It's something I had to do. For David.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
It's not here. Let's go.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
I hope you're right...
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Like... us?
I know that.
Worse... you're in Texas.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Where? Where is she?
What doesn't?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Isn't that the point?
He's waiting...
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
You can't do this -
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Pete have a brother?
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete... I do apologize.
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
I been calling for four months.
Who gave you this idea?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
I wrote. Not every week...
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Joe!
I'm doing okay, sir.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
I didn't call you anything before that.
No.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
How did it go with you guys?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
And you turned him down??
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
You stayed after all.
I don't want you to move.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
Does it still hurt?
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
What's the matter?
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
I bet you do!
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
You're welcome.
God.
I have the gun.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Keep your voice down.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Shut up.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Yeah, whatever.
Master bath.
Push that button for me, will you?
How many more do we have after this?
Why?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Damn it!
Yeah.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
We're never getting out of here.
Blue is phones?
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
No...
Lemme see that rifle son...
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
What are you crazy?
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
I'm down.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
What are you saying?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Yeah... cop hit me...
What do you mean, old and ugly?
I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.
What unit?
We did.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
What now, sir?
Is it?
You know how old I am.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
No...
What?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
You know what happened.
Go on.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
I am, I think.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
For what?
How many came back?
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Father, you can't let them take him...
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Ellie? What's wrong?
Huh?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Was it Pascow?
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
You folks ready to go on?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
What do you mean?
Whose burying ground?
Doesn't look like they last long.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
I think it's rather extraordinary.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
That's forgotten.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
We got that part.  Anything else?
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
I'll watch my back.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
A fool's errand.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Raise the sails.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
That's not true.
Depends.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She says it's not.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
It will be an ascension.
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
You don't want this.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What did he want?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
Of course, sir.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
What's it smell like?
Really?  What have you been doing?
Same old Daniel.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
I guess I should be flattered.
Yeah.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
Mouse?  What mouse?
What happened to it?
Just like old times.
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
We've got to get the nanobot.
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
That's impossible.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
A little? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
Stewart!
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
That's an excellent idea.
Mother!
I knew your managing editor very well.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
What play?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Quite so. Quite.
I beg your pardon, sir?
I bet.
and that
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
What did he want?
You quit trying to stop anybody
Traps shut!
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Well done, sir. Very neat.
What do you mean?
Yes.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
I'm sorry ...
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
It's alright. Let me see.
But I really should get home.
... Lover's Lane.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Want some bridge mix?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
It's like the basketball team.
The basketball team?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
What did you do?
Just take deep breaths.
Play along?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
It's in your closet.
He won't notice anyway.
Nothing.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Yeah ...
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Don't get upset.
I can't.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
Just gimme the damn remote!
What's wrong?
I'm so glad you're here.
... Yeah.
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Hi.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
And what was this?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm trying to be your friend.
No.
Nothing.
No.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Not very late.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
They're not open yet?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Hi.
Business is good, you're busy?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Who is it?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Hello?
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
About six months ago. Why?
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
...what...?
This is funny.
For work.....
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
Did you do it?
You're hand is bleeding.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
Who is this?
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
Like a psychiatrist?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
Why you wearin' a suit?
Hi, Lance.
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
What's up?
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
What are you doing?
I know.
Seriously.
I'll see you there.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Are you sure?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Should I call you later?
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
Marquis? Is that you?
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
It's no secret that you loved her.
I saw the longing in your eye --
Who's to say I did not?
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
His wife's?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
You're a sentimental man.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
Quite.
I'll pass the word on, then.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
Is it terribly erotic?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
What thought is that?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
The actor
There's nothing to explain
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
Yes?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Sir, I-
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Magic
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Jesus
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
Christ.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Thank you-
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
It came.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Pardon?
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
You're not still mad at me, I hope
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
Oh, no--
We're from...
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Screw you, Jack.
What do you mean, "you"?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
Take off my pants.
But, Jake, I was just...
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What's the matter with you?
I went out.
What'd you see?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Why don't you just call him?
I dunno.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Jefferies.
Jefferies.
For getting rid of that cast.
You did.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
I knew it!
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Huh?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
Got a shovel?
Smart girl.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Mrs. Doyle?
You haven't even heard from him?
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
You mean "goodnight."
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
What is it you're looking for?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
I wonder where he's going now?
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
That's a suitcase?
Your name?
Nobody chickened.
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
You awake?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
We don't have time.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
What's that pounding?
Who's there?  Anyone there?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
You scared?
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
Who knows.  Plato?
It's me!
Isn't it crazy?
That's swell.  How are you?
My gun?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Do I have to spell it out?
No.
Chicken?
Who lives?
Won't mother be proud.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I felt like it.
Ever been in a place like this before?
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
It is for me too.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
Good evening.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Yes it was all you --
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
Nick, what are you talking about?
I'm glad it was me.
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
You what...
What college.
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
I said, who the hell made the map?
We walked the place for a week.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Nnn... nothing...
No gun.
You gotta be kidding me.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Cancer-sucker.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
What the hell was that about --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Yeah.
GUARD! GUARD!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
But... I had a five...
Alone at last.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
I'm sorry.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
You gonna put it away?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Don't ask me that.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Gun shot.
Uh-uh, just cops.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Why!
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Tell them to come on in.
Like what?
We can't stay here!
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Tell me, darling.
What?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
All my clothes --
What was he in jail for?
Can I have my gun back?
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
What did you come back for?
You'll live.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I said I didn't care.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
Where is he?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Well, Steve?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
But you're his brother.
She was only teasin'.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
What about you, Buddy?
Better try a little higher.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Listen to me I --
So, whatever happened to her?
Let her go, Cin.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
What the hell are you doing?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
I got it!
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Hello Dwight.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
You're not wearing a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
It's okay. I understand.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
No woman would!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
So you do drink?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Who wants fruit salad?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
You got your wish.
That's like your car, Beverly,
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
He's a good boy.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
I'll give you fifty cents.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
We can't stand here all night.
Yes, I understand.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
Why, Mary --
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
No. She asked about the trademark.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
 What have you done about Irving August?
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
I think it's time.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Why?
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
But he also wrote --
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Yes.
Graham is an unusual name.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Mother, father, sister.
I don't know.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
You are?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
All of these are interviews?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
What about sex?
Maybe you want to go.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
I fantasized about you.
No.
How come?
Why not?
But I don't understand --
Don't do that.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Bastard...
God damn you!!
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Is he still at your house?
What brought this on?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Do you want to leave therapy?
Why, so you can go after him?
Well, I wonder why.
Lose something?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Well, what, then?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Why did you do that?
I can't believe you did that!!
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
There's a phone here.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Okay.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I would.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
John?
Cynthia. John.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
I just... Ann is very...
You trust him.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
I know. Will you please leave now?
It'll just be me.
Everybody has a past.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Hi.
Is that the man who called you up here?
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
You bet, Bert.
You got it!
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
I'm not going, Janet.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I NEED SOME
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
CRIMINAL
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Huh.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
And?
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Let me call Christine.
What color is it supposed to be?
That's what you do with every one.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
How do you know?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what's the plan today?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Later.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
What?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
What?
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Is she sleeping or...?
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Oh. You mean... today?
Well...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Okay.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Hello?
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
See you, Miles. You take care.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...Tell Graham --
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Chicken Teriyaki.
Should we turn off the lights?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
He was only a year and half old.
We won't be able to get out of there.
How do they know it's over?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Morgan?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
What was the first thing?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
You'll never make it.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I almost didn't.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
This is a brutal land.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Ten A.M.
It's a town...
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
You own this land.
That's a lie.
You wanted to see me?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
That ain't right.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Hello, Rae.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I just got to town.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
You like a good saloon?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
I've got a place I can hide her.
That was my plan.
Of course.
What about it?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
... Simone.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Hello?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Well, I --
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
No, I'm okay.
Hello, Hal.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
How will you do our love scenes?
You can't.
I know what you mean.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I was misquoted.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
I don't know anything about computers.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Why?
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
I do okay.  How about you?
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I don't understand.
You could play the lead.
A star is...
You know what I'm talking about.
Are you calling me?
Why, Malcolm?
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Don't step in the horse manure.
You're a doctor. What kind?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Why?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Can I ask you then?
I don't know, Cole.
Just help.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Lots of things.
Communicate?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Fuck you.
I happen to be a professional.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Carl, what are you doing?
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Curt Cobain.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Amends...?
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
About what?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
You wouldn't understand.
Suzie... No.
Mac... let's get out of here.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
That's not funny.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
Where are you?!
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
Kate McConnell.
Who'd want to?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
I'm proud of you.
One to five?
See ya, Bandit.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
I'm all ears, good buddy.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
I'm all ears.
Bandit II?
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Shut up, Fred.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
That's the point, Dickey.
Oh.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Mmm-hmm.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
True?
What were you doin' here anyway?
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
What's wrong?
What's the time frame?
I can trust Rheya.
No?  Who am I, then?
Listen --
You killed her!
Why, who did you see?
How long can you go without sleep?
Rheya.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
I need to see Snow.
You're better when you take them.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
You don't want me.
No.
You should have told me.
You never said you wanted one.
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
I can't --
What does it want?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
You didn't like him?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Let's get a drink.
Yeah.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
Could be, I guess.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
Yeah.
Tell it like it is.
What do you want?
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Stop being nuts!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
What a memory.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
Long enough.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Keep what handy?
Okay?
I'd identify him.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I watched TV.
What about Tommy?
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
How about dinner tonight?
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
No, no.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
I was there.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Huh?
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
My my.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Do you mind if I come too?
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
I'll introduce you.
Absolutely no class.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Need any more help?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Ready?
In this barracks?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Then we're all in on it?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
It is.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Let me go!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
Harry -- I'm blind!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
May I have this dance, Miss?
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
You did!
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Ach so!
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Which one of us is the informer?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Captain=8A
Data, are you all right?
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
Data, this isn't the time.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Left behind?
Soran?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
That's right.
That's right.
And what would that be, sir?
A photon torpedo?
What's normal?
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Status!
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
David!... What went wrong?
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
That may be difficult...
Why?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott...
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
So!  Speak!
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Well done, Commander.
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Time's up, Admiral...
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Just barely, sir.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
How far?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
I do this because I was there,
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
What do you mean?
Bones --
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
I suppose they told you that...?
Then --
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Where could you take them?
... Who are you?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Steady, now. We need your help.
Spock...?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What are the variables...?
You've programmed that from memory...?
Explain.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
What is our condition?
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Systems report.  Communications?
Two?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Right on. You fly?
Why?
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
And our people?
Very funny...
She's stabilizing.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
I don't believe it happened that way.
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
If it works you mean.
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
You've not aged a day since then?
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
... Population three hundred million...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
But it's comfortable.
All hands. Battle stations!
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Not yet.
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Do you know what this is, Data?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
Yes...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Always am.
Entering the upper ionospere...
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
That's impossible.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
Agreed. Options?
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Or not to be -
Figures.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I didn't mean this future.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Are you carrying a surgeon?
It takes a lot of effort.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
My God, what happened here?
That isn't true...!
Are those your words?
Yes.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Your friends are late...
What took you so long?
How much time's left of your sentence?
Except us.
I always wanted to try that.
Just the prototype.
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
Never been this close.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
Are you dining on worms?
Close enough to beam down?
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
We've been ordered to -
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Can you remember our father?
Why?
Why?
Is he very much like you were?
That was another time.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
A weapon.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
No.
Cannon fodder.
Sir, we're being hailed.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Serving with you has been an honor.
You know I need to verify this.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Yes.
Report!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
I make maps.
Do you have children?
What was your last stop?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
Shermin...
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
What?
Money.
What?!
Gas.
Shit.
A drink.
What's the matter?
It was yellow.
Yes.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Yes.
I am not a good singer.
Put that back.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Where did you learn that?
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
I know how to gamble now.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
There.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
I don't know where he is.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Very beautiful country up here...
To the same woman?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Hey, fuck you, man.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Faith, call me, okay?
Tonight.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
We should talk alone.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
So've I.  Too much.
Is he dead?
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
What do you mean?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Jesus!
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Strickland.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
Is this great fabric or what?
So the guy's not a sicko.
Well, look at the plus side.
I'm not going.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
You see Tran?
Alright.  We're going up.
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Um... he was older.
Testa?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Hi there.
You have the body?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
What are you...?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
He was sitting here?
He said it was a clue?
I think I talked to him.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
I was visiting an old college friend.
I didn't use Low's name.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?
Not especially.
The other reason?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
I've been thinking about this.
Find the feet?
Jesus.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
Not the way I can.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
It's quite advanced.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
I already have an employer.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Yes, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Yes, sir.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Shit.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Well, thank you...?
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
No...
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Listen. I had a great time.
Why didn't you call?
Right.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
Kinda money, huh?
There are so many beautiful women here.
I got to at least try once.
I'm such an asshole.
What's dumb about it?
Then why won't she call...?
It's kinda money, actually.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Mike?
Hello?
I don't know...
VEGAS.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Whu?
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
Always.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
She likes you.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
...So give me the fuckin part...
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Michelle went for you, right.
I just need some time...
I hear she's getting real fat.
This version doesn't have fighting?
No.
We got the digits, baby.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
No.
You think?
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
It's on...
The bear's got his claws back.
But your daughter is still alive.
The food is on the table.
Understood.
You think we'll go for that last place?
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
Should I bring him in.
For bravery.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Then why have I become a man like you?
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
What about McCluskey?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Please say it.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
How can you be sure?
To the city.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
A million times.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
You straightened my brother out?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Is that good?
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
He's drowning me!
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Can you mix a martini?
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
This is so good of you.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Could we sail to Venice?
What?
I played piano in a few places.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I didn't mean with you in it.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
I've got plans!
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Marge and I are getting married.
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Hardly.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
Hello Marge.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Where does Dickie live?
What?
It's all true.
What?
What's your secret?
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Ditto.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
What rumour?
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Was who Meredith?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
You got a .44 Magnum?
Yes?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
Well... mostly...
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Just what?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
No, why?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Who's a killer?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Huh?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What's so important?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Yes I am.
Why, thank you Travis.
No Sir.
Yes.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
How's your driving record?
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
Why?
Shit.
Travis.
So howsit?
Wiz?
It happens.
He's got a gun, sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I'm a field agent.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Partners?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
That always used to work.
Me too.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
City hall?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
When did you start smoking?
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Who... are they?
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
Luke... what time is it?
Jesus...
The G-man?
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
Jesus.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Exactly.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
It's about me.
What happened?
I suppose.  Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
No.  Absolutely not.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Yes.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
I guess you knew that, anyway.
I suspected as much.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
I did.
Look.
No!
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Yes?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
What name?
Are you sure?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
You did say birds?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
Oh, my God, look at her!
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
I started to say... inside...
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Sixty...  Oh.
What?
Doesn't what make me...?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
How can you tell?
How?
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
What did it say?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
What?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.
I wrote the letter.
Why?
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
And Fridays? What do you do then?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Some cream?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Hear!
It's so damn quiet out there.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I'm frightened, Mitch.
How long have they been gathering there?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Santa Rosa?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
I'm not sure, but...
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I haven't finished my drink.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
I've heard of it.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
But you did promise.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
She's unconscious.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
What?
Where shall we put it? In the back?
This is not a woman!
I will not have you use that name to me.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I take no gifts from you.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
I come from Lisbon.
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye --
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
We won't.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Someone else did it.
You killed that cop Dutton.
... it connects you to me...
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Fucking crow.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
An accident, Nathan.
Anything wrong?
You want me to walk a straight line?
What were you yelling about?
Are you ok?
What? What is it?
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
I leave that in your hands.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
What does that mean?
Did all these people die in wars?
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Hello--
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
What is it you want?
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
They would have killed this man?
All day.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
I can't beat a Triumph.
What is this, David?
Oh, no...
Ouch, my hair...
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
Did we have a date tonight?
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Okay?
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Ohmygod...
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Say hello to Thorn.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Does it burn?
What's your name?
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
You've got to put this on.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Nanook...
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
What you doin'?
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
How you doin', old boy?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
We got to burn 'em.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.
MacReady!
Garry's missing!
Spaceship of some kind.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
What are you doing?
A couple of hours.
No.
We're on fire!
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
I had an accident.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
Yes.
Vox --
Vox...
Alexander.
How do you control the Morlocks?
And what of the Eloi?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
A man can change his history.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Let's walk through the park...
I'm sorry, David.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
Good night, David.
This... was my home.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Is he all right?
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
Thank you.
I don't understand.
You liked it there.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
It was different then.
Yes, sir, he --
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
Why?
New Yorkers.
We don't know.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
We choose to believe it.
How did you get hurt?
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Sir?
You ok?
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
I don't understand...
This is really happening, isn't it?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
You two ok?
[Beat] What's your name?
But I like it I guess.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
Do you really believe me?
I don't believe a thing she just said.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
I've been ok.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
My God you look exactly like him.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
It doesn't look all that different.
How...how do you know?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Beat] How do you know?
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Well, where are you from?
No.
[Beat] Why?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
You want anything special for dinner?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
What?
On what?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Who's the nut?
Who do you think did it?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
We're both fine.
Hey.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
No!
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
What did ya do?
You're a bank robber?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Am I in trouble?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Try to.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Sorry!
You do?
What'd I say again?
Good.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
You too, sweetie, the best.
Isn't it beautiful?!!
Oh, Jesus!
What?
I'll try to be more careful.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
No harm, no foul?
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Well why don't you look her up?
Why not?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
How'd you know that?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
That sounds like fun.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Miami?
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Your turn?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Meaning?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Magda!
You don't think they're too big?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
Huh?
Ted, are you okay?
Really? I never got a message.
Oh... are you... ?
Now by killer, you mean...?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Why not?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Mary, come on...
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Well, there's only one thing to do.
No! I was pissing!
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Well, I'm not.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
Jesus...
And?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
Yeah.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
When are you going to be home?
How's my favorite President?
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
No you weren't.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
You're my hero, Carl.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
What's this about?
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Six rounds. 357.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
I'll sleep around a little.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Ray...
Bullshit.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
What did he say?
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Sorry.
What's that?
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
I desecrated it?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
There you go with those moves again.
I can't.
How about what?
How about anything, anything you want to do.
You're an animal.
Does it bother you?
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
It's just as I thought.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
I want it back.
It does.
I sit. I think. I play games.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
Want to play the game?
Now?
That's three.
Well?
Well what?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Yes, Sergeant?
Remember one thing.
Can't shake him.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
I'm pulling up.
Not anymore.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
I've got it -- hold on!
No! Not again!
Is there something I should know?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
We did it!
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
That's because you don't have any women.
What now?
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
Who is the best.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Just below ten thousand.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You didn't help.
Sir?
Why?
No bother.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
Fuck you.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Suppose I do...then what?
Pull them out.
They sell fake memories.
Hey, Quaid!
Harry!
What trip?
I want that fucker dead.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Quit while you're ahead.
Nobody.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
You went to those brain butchers?!
It was implanted by the Agency.
I suppose you're not here either.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
No options.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
I don't need Kuato for that.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
You know, up the jeep trail.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Road's in!
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
What?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Burt!  Heather!
Yeah, Val.
What?
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Ms. Vin's sister.
Don't hurt him.
-- With objection!
I noticed.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I can describe it.
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Not the whole time, of course. I --
We have a full caseload, Rog.
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
I embellished.
I haven't paid you.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Want to tell me what went down here?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
About Chinatown. What went down.
No.
See-cil.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
-- Every word.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No... No, go away.
I'm nearly out.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
OK, Gordon.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
What?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Sorry to hear it.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Shorthand. Really?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I don't know, Sam.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Are you going to see James tonight?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Well, why not?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
No, you should forget about last night.
No.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Oh, Laura.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
When he finds out.
You want to see...
You'd think so.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Laura.
What were you doing in my room?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Did you get this from your lover?
There's no one here.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
He was accused of jury tampering.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
And no one will know the truth.
What does it mean?
No.
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
No.
How is that?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...I made a reservation at...
I didn't do too well for you.
No, you did fine.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Yes.
Do you know who her doctors were?
Who told you that?
Yes.
Why is that?
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
And what are you? A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Why don't you get some rest?
I...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
What are you going to do?
Mr. Alito, please.
How come you're calling me from...?
Kathy Price.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
No.
I didn't do it, Mister.
...I'm sure you do...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
...hey, I don't need your charity...
What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
I'm going to help her.
Mick. Mick. Mick...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
The broad has disappeared...
...four years ago...
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Hey, how about that!
Did you see it come down?
Did it do you any good?
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
What's he like?
They've all stopped at the same time.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
How long was I out?
Nothing there now.
What was it like?
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They've blocked it!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
He's had some sort of...episode.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Does he have to stay here over night?
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Right 'cross the freeway.
Dylan, where's the man?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
When do you think it'll be done?
Really?
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
I know how Chase really died.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Then what is he doing?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Yes sir.
Make us proud.
Where's Mom?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Gieg, Chuck.
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
You know, I never had friends like this.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Hey, shut up will ya?
Is it true Phil?
Ah... Northeast... sir.
What's on your mind?
Of what?
They have every right Chuck.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
Twice.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Don't ever call me stupid.
What?
Tie it off!!
Swing up, son.
I understand.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Why? He's right in the groove.
What's Cao Ben?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
You black?
No... I don't think so, man.
That's right... Take one of these.
Nice of you to drop by.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
What's the name of it?
Club Zanzibar.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
In what capacity?
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
I'm scared, mama.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
And you never told nobody about it?
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
They sure do stink.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Oh shit...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
Lula, you there?
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Now what?
You sick?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
You must be my son.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
LULA!!!!
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Six.
Got any plans?
What if I asked you not to?
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Yes.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
You got nice tits.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
So I hear.
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
He lives with his mother.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
How bad is it for you?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
You cold, James?
A little.
Heaven?
Is that really it?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Who?
The guy on the phone.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Blocked.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Carvel.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
No thanks.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
When?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Yes, Hannah?
Me? Sure. Why?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
That good, huh?
You go first.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Well...
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
What's he doing out there?
What is it, Grady?
Do you get high, Sam?
I was thinking of you.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Are you riding with me, James?
Beautiful. How's business?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
How old is Anna?
Cherry.
It was a beautiful present.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Their sound is quite musical.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
I think you do.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
You can't talk to me like --
They grow outside, don't they?
You walked home.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
I don't know.
I could take you downtown.
The passionate one?
Yes.
Apartment's okay.
But you are taking it?
Yeah, like the bird.
Do you have many friends?
It sounds like you were banished.
Robin?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Why not?
I don't understand.
We have a lot of work to do.
They usually tell me.
Fuck you, Rosen!
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Where?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
There's something wrong with this picture.
What?
What about bears?
You're still here.
It's been a while since...
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
You mean the time you're locked away?
Their power. They seduce me.
And what do you tell yourself now?
What?
You're scared.
Do you want to talk about it?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Nice shot, Lins.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Jesus, Lindsey--
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
You dumb jarhead motherf--
They'll come out after us.
I don't know how!
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Do we just leave him there?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
You better not say you missed that.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
How many are there?
How deep?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
You already know what they are.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Well, what?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Oh, Sandro...
Claudia, listen to me...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
No, Sandro... Please...
Why?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
I love you.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
I'll stay here also.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
And where do you find the models?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Zuria?
I would like to ask you something.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
It's a sin to be fat.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Who?
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
I'm being punished.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
That wasn't me.
Let's talk about something else.
Well, who in particular?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Oh, I know he does.
He's told you?
At least once a week.
Would you like to talk about it?
Did it hurt?
Yes.
What baby?
Then let's talk about something else...
Would you like to ask them?
Would you like some?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Who?
Why not?
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Not my fault.
Everything... I don't have children.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
She tells you you're ugly?
Why?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Yes.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
I'm frightened.
Yes.
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
We went to chapel for vespers.
A crucifix.
What do you feel?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Which one?
She said Michael.
Are you frightened?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Yes.
Who?
It was dead.
She took the baby in her arms?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
What?
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Marty, what are you doing here?
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
What's his name?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
I've already told you what I thought.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Was the child full term?
When was that?
Sister Paul?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know... 
Don't deny it!
I'd like to begin.
Of course.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
You're what?
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
But how did it happen?
She is an innocent.
Is it because she's a nun?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The baby?
And the baby.
They're yours.
Shurrup!
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
The police station.
I'll murder that Lennon.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I don't care.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
It's Paul's grandfather.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
The big hammer?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
But that's not like a real person at all.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
You're only right.
What are you doing?
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Clean though, isn't he?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Let's go and muck in.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
I'm not, no.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
It's not my fault.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Nerves.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Where's Irth?
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Breathe deeply.
A transmission?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Hey, guess what?
It's clear.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
Can you do anything for him?
Oh my God.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
Look at that.
This is horrible.
That must have been when he got it.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
It won't come -- it's stuck.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
Are they close?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
What the hell happened?
Oh well... you know me.
Where did the parasites come from?
Now what?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
Two down, four to go.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
What did it do to you?
I'll get you out of there.
What is it?
Thanks.
Shit.  When?
What's going on?
Deal.
Hey, Guttierez?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Is it still moving?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Okay.
Is this the suit?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
What is that?
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Agreed.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Give me a yell is something happens.
Phoebe?
You're more than modest.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
It needn't be.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Yes. I do.
D-day.
Just like it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
We're?
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
She was a liar, she was a liar!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Yes, Addison.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Huh?
Nothing?
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Bill...
You're my girl, aren't you?
When - when are you coming back?
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
How is Eve? Okay?
I thought you were going to be late-
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So she seems.
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
No heart to burn.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I've been aware of that for some time.
Lemme fix you a drink.
But she just got here...
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
Birdie-
Why not?
Night an' day.
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
How did you get in here?
I might.
That's the door.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Oh, no...
Hollywood.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
But the raves about your performance-
- an understudy's performance.
Over my dead body...
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
Did you see it here in New York?
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
I've got it.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
They're your fans, your audience-
Harrington.
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
He's in love with you.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Well...
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
With gestures, of course.
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
What's so funny?
Who's left out there?
How do you mean?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I have no intention of having an accident!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
That depends.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Would you?
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
Hey?
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
Why didn't we get that?
Sure.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--shit--
--I know, I know--
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--Teddy Kennedy?
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--that was awhile ago--
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
I think.
There's always a later plane.
FBI too?
You've really got to go.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Who were they?
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
--this'll only take one second--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Mitchell knew then.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
I think so.
It may never come out.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
You can't believe that.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
No, it was good.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Sure.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Me too.  For the most part.
Of course, I didn't --
You can call me Ostreicher.
Nice car.
Hi...
Onions?
What?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
What?
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Went home to shit.
You can send me the address too.
But, but -- what would I do?
Dad!  I know!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Jim...
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
But you don't love me.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Ready for what?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Also like sex with my wife.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
What the fuck!? You too!?
I know where he'll go.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Before the coma!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Because Gaston was after it.
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Well?
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Noooo....
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
What happened to your parents?
Come on up!
It's the best fork of all
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Do you remember this?
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
Don't you, child?
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Bartok... a question.
What was that?
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
What do you mean?
So where will you go?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Perhaps you could convince her?
What's your name?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
What do you mean, next?
Yes.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Yes.
We've been through this.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
M'm.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Nice car.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Fifteen years?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
I know.
Yeah.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
We can digest our-
Yeah?
No.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah.
You see, like you and I...
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Yes, it is.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
You're so sure about it.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
What's- It's me, open up.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Yeah.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
That's sick!
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
You like this house, Max?
There are no twos, Max.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
You fired the cleaning woman?
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
What?
I'll change back before we leave.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
So where is young Jonah?
Let's get the kids.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
I'm the hired help.
That for us?
Sally?
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Just did.  Jealous?
When does he graduate high school?
The suspense is killing me.
And?
Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.
Monica.
Oh yeah?
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Probably not.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
You only made half your quote this year.
Kiss the back of my knees.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
It's an unfair advantage.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Love?
And how hard it hit?
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
I know.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Don't I find what?
Ah.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
And you know, he really does not.
And Ryan works at home.
Are you okay?
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
What am I, five?
That's very nice.
I like you.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Sorry?
How do you do, Skye?
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Excuse me?
What?
I'm sorry.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
If he were still alive, maybe.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Like your business managers?
It's our anniversary, Panes.
We're just feeling our way back.
What does that mean?
Thank you, Panes.
Yes.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
And here they are!
He's a novelist.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
How should <u>I know</u>?
Well I guess that makes us even.
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
And only you can become a Queen?
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Of course not --
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
That's correct, sir!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
ARREST HIM!
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
What did you do to your hair?
That makes me feel just terrible.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Your phone.
Two o'clock.
No -- I don't want anything.
His apartment?
As soon as I can walk.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Cut.
I just want some fresh air.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Over a girl?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Fine. How's your eye?
How's everything at the apartment?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I guess so.
That's very wise.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Baxter?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
How would you like to go tonight?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
No I didn't.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
It's regulations.
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
No.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
I took sleeping pills.
Will you excuse me?
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
You know I liked it better long.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Handle what?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Yeah, we better.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Where do you live?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Lovely. You were a big help.
Where are you headed?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
I like all of them --
No -- absolutely not --
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Fat. That's real fat.
We do.
Probably is.
Yeah, I know.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
What is it?
Would he remember you ?
Touchy.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
No, sir.
Yeah.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Change.
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
No water.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
Yes...
And you admired him?
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
What?
Nah.
Which one's the Colonel's?
You think he'd of shot us?
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
You're Australian?
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
What will you do after the war?
What if I say no.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
What?
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?

Six months.
Where'd you say Eric is?
He's coming around fine.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
-- Permanently?
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Be my guest.
Forget it.  It would take days.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Too bad we're heading west.
How many do you see?
Where's my ELT?
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
It's Sam Wilder!
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Yes.
How old are you?
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
So you'll be at work?
No, sir...
I can't. I work.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
I was going to do that for you.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Stop asking everyone.
Yeah... Well...
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
What job?
What a break...
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
One night with me!
What the heck are those for?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
What?
About a dog.
Absolutely.
Oh, is he dead?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
No, I didn't.
Go away.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Uh, Fontella's
No shit.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
We go around once.
Okay.
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Who?
Know what?
I bet you fucking know!
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Bullshit.
Okay.  How did you find me?
With computers.
It's not the same, is it?
Why?
Where you wanted to be?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
I was just different.
Ahhhh...
They tried to kill you?
Why?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except --
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I went into their room this afternoon.
No.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
What are you doing?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
When did it start?
Uh-huh.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
What?
I wasn't watching television.
Hi.  Did you call --
I prefer it like this.
Sometimes.
All the time.
Then, I'll sail alone.
Is that all you want?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Why not?
A dime.
Taken.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
Anything in it?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
I thought that was part of the charm!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Need any disks?
We're going to need it all.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Damn!
Now you're using that word.
What do you want me to do?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
Good morning.
So am I.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
No, I love you, really.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
They'll do it.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
I had it coming from someone.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
You will wish you hadn't.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
We had a deal!
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Sure!
I think we should be going honey.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
You are quite sure it's secure?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
Late night.  You?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
I'm thinking.
You.
Get yourself a glass.
'Is it really me?'
Why?
You're really into God, right?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
I haven't been nice to you.
Hey.
I might do it wrong.
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
I'm sick.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Did you give him a gift?
No.
It was a play.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
You've been well?
When do I get time for me?
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Thank you.
So what did we just make?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
How was school today?
Learn anything?
How are you?
Fine..
I'm going to be at the dance.
And where am I gonna be?
Your line, George!
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Not a holocaust --
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Eight thirty.
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Pardon me?
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
An atomic bomb.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
No way!
I used to throw trash for the City.
Mmmmm.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
What're you doing?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Think I got 'em?
Everybody loves trout.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I just don't want to go.
Really?
Hi.
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Let her out. In my custody.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You.  Like the papers all say.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Please, Barton.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
I want to know!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
Yeah, he's funny that way.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 
Ever act?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
I didn't say anything-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
Go ahead, son.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
You're leaving?
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
...Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
Yeah.
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Mr. Lipnik, I 
I apologize, Barton.
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Where were you tonight?
All night?
How about the coke?
What was she like?
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
I don't need any help.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Yes.
I don't smoke.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
Sure.
Didn't you study it in school?
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
What did you think?
What happens to them?
I hate rugrats.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
What was the weapon?
I don't know.
You feeling better?
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
I'm going with you.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
On what basis?
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Yes I did.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
What about the shit they write?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Do you still love her?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Is Jean Michel here?
MOTHAFUCKAH!
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
They're just words.
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
Not what?
Out?
Still not here.
You got a date already?
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
We got beat.
You gonna carry that around all night?
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
You do! You definitely do.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
Hi.
I really... admire you.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
That's a beautiful name. French?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Admiring your handiwork?
Well that's a ... long story ...
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
Nope, I told her everything.
Photojournalist.
Nor I, on the second.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
You buy this "blurry" business?
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
I'm on break from-
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
Umm-hmmmm.
Can he save her?
She knows who we are.
If we could relay the sunlight-
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
And?
What?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Where is my wife?
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
He ran away?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
How are you feeling, young man?
...Afraid.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
To kill me.
Like normal folks.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
And now....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
Touchy, touchy.
Excuse me.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
A hit.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Please.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
And you want a --
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Are they paying you for all this?
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Yeah. Deja vu.
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
It's the last thing we need.
Scottish.
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
0 my god.
shhh...
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Here, let me do that.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Howls he getting on with the family?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Maybe two cars.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Welsh again.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
Yes?
It is urgent, sir.
off the peg?
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Of course he is.
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
She sure does.
I am sitting.
Two hours.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Handbook?  When...?
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Why not?
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
I cannot believe this.
Any particular kind?
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
What's wrong?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Attic space.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Otho, that's terrible.
Oh, fine.
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Thank you.
Yes. I am.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Yes. I was.
Oh, I like that very much.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
I see.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
I certainly do.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
I feel very good in here.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Thank you, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes. I like to watch.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
... Evening, Chance.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
I see.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
I live here.
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
Correct.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
... Nothing.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
Yes? What have you found?
Gardiner, yes, sir.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Thank you, Colonel.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Yeah.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
What?
Is the trial date set?
Hi.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I have to go back.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Suck my dick!
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
My God!
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
You're insane.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Emily Dickinson.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
I've fallen in love.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
No. Don't be an ass.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Impressions? Those are hard.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
I love you, Lotte.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
Yeah, I saw them
Who's calling?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
You've got to be kidding.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
I want somethin' sweet.
Don't pay to complain.
I miss her.
Well, what can you do?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Could be that fall you took.
Till she showed herself.
What run him off? Tell me that!
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Jesus.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
No, You looking good.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
NUSSING!
Can we just rent it from you?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
What--
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Please!  Please!
And what do you do, sir?
No.  Here.
Ahh, not so good, man.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yeah, but my-
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
So...that doctor.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
What the fuck?
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
The nail polish, Walter.
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Now Dude--
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Not exactly a lightweight.
And the fucking money!
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
There weren't any shots.
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Walter Sobchak.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Brandt, give him the envelope.
You come all the way down here to roust--
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
You're hurt.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
You don't want to go there.
Why do you hate us so much?
It means "bloodbrother."
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
So?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
His name is Jared Nomak.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
What about you?  You're not coming?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Don't try to talk --
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Is something wrong, my friend?
It worked, didn't it?
It's dark in here.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
That's weird --
What?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
What -- ?
What happened to the power?
What're you doing there?
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
--Christ almighty--
That's a joke?
Jesus.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
You don't want it though.
I want to see the tapes.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I can't.
Then I'm going--
--like you hurt the baby--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
I know, I know.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
What I never could figure about the movie?
Yeah?
What're you, crazy??
--yeah, a hand or something--
What about night?
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Fucking owl!
For "James?"
What?
Oooh. Oooh.
Dad...?
What?
Sure. I'm sorry.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
What the fuck's going on here?
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Uh-huh.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Ray?... What time is it?
...Ray?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...You leaving?
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
What night is it?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Uh-huh.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
...Just doin' my job.
Well what?
What do you think?
What.
Don't throw that out.
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Where was I?
Tuesday.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
It must be great.
What is this? What color is it?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Is Sandy part of this?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Not yet.
Hello, baby.
Who's this fuck?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Don?
See my nipples?
Yes.
Hi. can I come in?
I sure don't hate you.
Do you like my body?
Yes.
I love you Don with all my heart.
Oh no.
Who, Dorothy?
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Here's to Ben.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
That's too bad.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I've gotta go in.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
You really want to do this, don't you?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Okay. yeah, call.
Yeah?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
I'm really sorry.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Yeah?
I'm going out for awhile.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
He what?
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
You happy, baby?
Should we buy it?
Are you kidding?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Surprise.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Excuse me?
The coca is my responsibility!
No.
I don't think so.
I heard.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
What?
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Please, continue.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
George.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Today.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
Keep them coming.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
What do you guys want?
Figured it out.
Figured what out?
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
I said, I've seen it before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
No, that's alright.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
But I've got school.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Yes, I do.
Who's the co-pilot?
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
The strike is a success; but ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
I don't even know your name yet ...
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Of course. As soon as possible.
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
It could've happened to anyone.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Yes.
Like cats and dogs.
Sex.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
No questions.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Aren't they all?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Objection!
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
No -- never.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
I was angry.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
No.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Did he make your life miserable?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
I suppose.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
P.M.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
Frank!
How?
Is it against the law?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
You don't need anybody.
I'm dropping the case.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
The witness will answer the question.
Why did you lie to me?
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Well, I'd like to read them.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Not yet. You want to go?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Why, do you think?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
I'll pick you up.
Oh, how is he?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
How about if I set the table?
How about Bari?
Nobody's asking you to.
I can't do this, honey.
Where was she?
Yes, thanks.
What?
Yes. And I've accepted.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Died there?  How?
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Is this Hell?
I want you to do something for me, baby.
But.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
It's alright, baby.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Why?
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Let me see it.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Not that I remember.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
But the place burned to the ground.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Know what?
The same way you did before.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
He didn't see you, did he?
...  maybe three hours.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
We were in a car accident --
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
I should have let him kill you.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Hello?
Truck.
Truck.  Of course.
Caesar is your husband?
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Because it's the truth.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Yes.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
What happened?
He does it right in front of him.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
I was so afraid you ...
Hey.
No.
Oh, God.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
What do you mean?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Yes.
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
Look, maybe I should just...
...yes -- oui -- uh...
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
-- sir? --
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
I need a ride out of here.
I want to go home.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Okay, so you're a victim.
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
I don't remember any of this.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
He's dead isn't he?
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
xxxxxx.
Who is it?
xxxxxx
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What?
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
What if it doesn't come back?
...Be back.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
Er ... Thanks ...
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Gillian Layton?
Ah ...
What has Tuttle done?
Tell me about Layton.
Take her off the list.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Jack?... Jack?
Where do I get it stamped?
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Turn!
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
Would you really, Sam?
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
I never signed the form.
What! Shit!
She didn't say anything about it to me.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Sam!!! 
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Are we?
What the - ? How did you - ?
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You know each other a long time?
She asked me to pick her up.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
No.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
I know him. That's Noel.
Did you see my father?
You look so different.
He's better, though, right?
How long you been doing this?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I need to sit down a minute.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
I hate vodka.
Where you going?
I quit! I'm through!
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
How can that be? He was getting better.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
You okay?
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Frank!
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
Shit, shit, shit...
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
You're feeling good, aren't you?
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
I don't think so.
Hold it down, okay?
It's nice to see you.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Yes.
I didn't know you were going with him.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
What?
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
How?
Let's go...
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Do it then.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I wish it were you giving the story.
That's okay.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
If we could just eat first.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
You okay?
Nervous?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
No.  Were you going to you?
It's incredible who's here.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
Then give me a minute...
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
A picnic?
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I didn't finish talking to you!
What's up, Walter?
Is it murdered man?
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Walter...there's...
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Are you alright?
Why not?
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Man this is heavy!
What is it, your laundry?
I didn't mean to.
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
You know what that proves?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
A show..how soon can we go?
Did you see my cat?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
T-tell him that?
If you see him.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Well, um... litter?
No, we didn't.
It's coffee.
You didn't like them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Wheels?
Excellent.
Nothing.
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Hi.
You want some water or something?
Not exactly.
Hey, Buffy...
I know.
He did what he was supposed to.
I crashed your party.
Are you okay?
Beverly Center.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
What, um...  What do we do?
Not a pressing issue.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
A what?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
No THX.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I can't!
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Well, I hope so.
And Spring Fling.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Except for Prom.
And the January Semi-formal --
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Switch nostrils?
How was that?
A little better.
No.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Yes I do...
We lost.
See my hips?
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Will that work for me?
You spit on me!
Beg me again!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
C ' mon!
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Step outside, pal.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
It's a damn convention.
Looking for Crash Davis.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
You were never my guest?!
He even played golf with the President.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
No, you're not calm.
Oh, good.
Stop -
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
I can't! I'm tied!
Mommy.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Somethin', huh?
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
...very difficult to get in.
You think he got the point?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Practice enough this week, you prick?
What people?
Back -
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
You never - ?
Hello.
Yeah, she's here.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
Now, he's really pissed.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Yeah, I know all that.
You're with me now.
Uh-huh.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Hi. Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Huh?
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
What do you mean?
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
I gotta tell ya...
...under?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
I threw it away.
I put her to bed.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
Oh...
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You are not threatening me anymore!
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Well...
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
You can't talk to me like...
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
Pitch-black?! It -
Hey!
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
He's comin' over.
He's gone?
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
Hey, Frankie.
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
Of course, Remo.
Mm.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Am I right?
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I do.
Hm.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Yes.
All right.
Do you know that?
You do?
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Mm-hm.
You know why, right?
Come here, come here.
You must have drunk too much.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
You're probably right.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Selina, are you okay?
We're waiting.
Wha-at?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
Next time, call...
Nothing. How's your hand?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
Any place.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Say something ...
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
That's your "rep."
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
My name is --
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
Please.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
It's locked.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
L.A.P.D.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
He wants 75 back.
259-7881.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I don't want it.
Just relax.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
We're waiting on you.
Negative.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
There's two police cars now.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Scottish?
So let's call this the usual.
He gave me a look.
Did I?
Thank you.
Take your clothes.
No.
And what's it like?
Who's she?
Jimmy.
You know.
What would he think?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Details, baby, details.
He'd bring me carnations.
Come on...
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You knew which man?
You killed my Jody
Whatever you say, Dil.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
I promise.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
That's wise, Tommy.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
Leave her out of this.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
And what if I say no?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Who's the old geezer?
So?
You OK about that?
Would make me feel better about it.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Should blow you away, you know that?
Am I?
Do what?
Not in your nature.
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
No.
She'd be anyone's type.
Absolutely not.
You make a nice couple.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
Can't. Once I signed up.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Can't.
Shut up, would you?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Having two pints in the Rock.
It's as simple as that?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
You stupid bastard --
I said you bastard -- stop --
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Who gives a fuck.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
Where are you, ol' buddy?
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Reggie -- please believe me!
Then say it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
But --
Caf.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Steal it how?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
But you're -- divorced?
Very pretty. Now what?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Your --
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who told you to do that?
Maybe.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
What -- like Scobie?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Yes, I know.
What? Assassinate somebody?
What are you doing?
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Yes.
How much is it worth?
Not unless we're blind.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Is that all? Can I go now?
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
Voil what?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Quitter.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
What are you doing in here?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
You do?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I get all your CDs.
You said that two weeks ago.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
Ok.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
You found her?
What are you doing?
This will relax her.
Can you get inside?
No.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Pay no attention to me.
What?
I'm sure you should have failed.
Then you should go.
_ Your father raped someone?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
FINE. Are you?
What party?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Are you O.K.?
I did.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
My dad's down there!
Mom?
Yes?
Did he say anything else about her?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Yes.
On what side of the family?
I got to go.

Where do you want this stuff?
...moron.
What did I say?
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
I need your truck!

Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
 Excuse me...
You stole this truck! That's...
...the ice cream for money!
I ain't playin' that.
...-damn!

    Elvis is on ice again.
...I'm not the psycho.
Holy shit...
...man!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Oh, shit.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
...easy, easy, easy.
...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
 Go, go.

...yeah.
 Listen!  Listen...

Oh, no!


...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
Hey, just shut up.
 Come on!


We!
  I've got the real thing!
...tunnel!
Whoo!
What the hell?
Shoot me. 
What?
 Vitelli! Vitelli!

Sorry.

Who had to put a gun to your head?
Us.  Owes us.
I think so too.
Thank you.
...us.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
But...
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Doc-...
...-lar.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
...destroyer of worlds."
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
Grateful?
"Went away."  I like that.
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Of which we have more than enough.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him.

Shit.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
You know the suspect?
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...scientists.
...gear?
Mornin'.
...to die for a country that's...
I don't see my container.
Your fellow hero, untouched...

 
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
You got thirty minutes.
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Hit it...
No sign of 'em...
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!

Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
And where are you going?
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.

My secret?
He's brains without ambition...
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
...you answer mine.
...hands!
...stole a truck under arrest.
...on the other end of this phone.
The Army, sealin' us in.
Get in 


 Talk to me.
Oh.
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Would you call him a capable man?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
What for?
No.
My daughter.
What about her?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
Where is she?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
They don't kill a guy for that.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I've been wanting to meet you.
The apple core?
How do they do that?
Oh yes.
No?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
How do you happen to know her?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
And why's that?
It's too late.
What for?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
Of course.
A complete surprise?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Not that Mulwray?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
I can't tell you.
For very long?
Another satisfied client?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
The Valley?
No, I think I'd remember.
I gave everybody the night off.
Just... I have to.
The Albacore Club.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
It's possible.
The police?
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
I am not!
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
I want to see her.
...no...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
I'm all right.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
When did you come in?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
A Miss Sessions calling.
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
That's for sure.
Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Hi, Elena!
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
I don't care. I'll wait.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
So what's that got to do with it?
Mr. Kane -
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
I didn't see that.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Yes -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
I'm sure that's it. 
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Oh yes, there is.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
You're very easily amused.
Oh!
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
You really don't know who I am?
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
You're my wife, Susan, and -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I won't let you go.
You goin', Mom?
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
It's been a tough day.
Charlie -
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Why, Brad?
She's going to leave you -
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
Mr. Leland, you were -
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
What did you get?
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Am I sure about what?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
It's not the same.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
So where is he?
No, this is great.
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Train. It took eight hours.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
But you were.
I'm giving him his ring back.
I just told you.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Sang.
How'd you get here so fast?
Like what?
Stop this. This isn't funny.
With this guy locked in?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Your mother.
I'm talking to myself here.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Yeah.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
What did he say?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Thirty-seven!
I'm going to miss the game.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Julie Dwyer died.
Jesus.
Number six.
It's today.
You hardly knew her!
You hate people.
She meant nothing to you!
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
An embarrassing way to die.
Who found him?
He made it, hunhh?
Listen to you.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Why should I loan you my car?
Let me borrow your car.
And this is what you rented?
Living proof.
Holy shit. That girl?
There's no lights back there.
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
As if it's that easy.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
You didn't have to choke me.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Excuse me?
How do you know that?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
With you? I don't think so.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Jesus... go ahead.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
What were you doing?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
I'm not the pig you are.
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
He requested this?
That's because I never had sex with him!
You sucked his dick!
HOW MANY?
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
What's this?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
No way.
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
I think the lady called it.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
To an Asian design major.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
I beg your pardon!
That's the price, my brother.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Twenty bucks?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
What?
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
Surprise me.
What the hell are you doing here?!
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
You can stop right there.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't expect you to understand.
Excuse me?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Gabe are you alright?
I won't do it.  No way.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Just kidding.
What about you?!
No, he's gone.
On top of the peak.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Where's the rest of the team?
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
This way.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Well, shall we get down to it?
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
You've not been to school all week, son.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Do you feel that way now?
Do you still feel suicidal?
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
I did, sir.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Good.
What job and how much?
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Well - I'm back.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
We're going to friends now, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
When was the last time you took one?
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
...he's two floors below you.
What kind of question?
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Very generous.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
I was with Max when he got the call.
What's your name?
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Who is this?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
I don't think I can do this.
Two...
I tried it.
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
I can't believe this.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Jazz.  Music.
No.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Would you have called her?
I don't know.
Then what are you?
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow down.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Them who?
Yes.
That's it?
You're certifiable.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Has this happened to you before?
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
He's why you punish yourself.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Jerry, I --
Now what?
Where are we going, Jerry?
Liza?
At a horse show.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Without a song in my heart.
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
Do I know you?
I'm a very patient man.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
And what did I say?
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay.  I'm game.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
We've lost contact.
Is it possible...?
Hope there's a cartoon.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Ellie...
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
You mean --
Ellie.
I don't understand.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
You...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
So who...?
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
Am I one... or many?
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
Now... you go home.
No more stalling, Captain.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
-- I'm moving to Washington.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
But what about your research -- ?
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
I read your book.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
Ellie --
How do you mean?
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
-- I don't know --
Hi.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
Meaning...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
But I made this arrangement --
Gotta have kings.
We saw the broads.
I don't know, Boss.
You got your mind right, Luke?
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Go git it, Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
So then you just call him.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Somebody say somethin'?
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Like an elephant.
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
Cuter again.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
No. No chains either.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I was?  How you spell that?
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
We'll show that to...
Maybe you should...
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
Are you always so bold?
You know how to use this?
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Because it's your job, that's all.
It's none of my business anymore...
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
You messed with the scene.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
And her husband? What was he?
What!? They brought the car here?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Are we allowed to park here?
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
I did this already.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
I want to see my mother immediately.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
What's all the dreck?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
You're slowing.
Tell us every detail.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
Which flowers did you order?
Mom, please.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Don't be fresh.
I'm really not that hungry.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
Letty.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
Really, this isn't funny.
For a price.
We'll get caught.
What's my rap?
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
Tell the doctor.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
This must be Beast.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Michael, take it easy.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Yeah?
What are you doing?
Can you loan me a 20?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Yes, I suppose so.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
All tapped out.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Where did they go?
It's Elvis...
It's me...
You're calling me on is phone?
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Hello?
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Why are you here?
Uh, no --
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
Get that, will you?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Turn on the flashlight.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
Do I?
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
All right, knock it off.
What do you want now?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
-- Did you set it up?
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
I just thought that--
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Yes.
What is it you do, Sami?
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Anybody know about that car outside?
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
And you don't speak French?
What does arresting us get them?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Who's gonna see it there?
Why?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
And if I use them to kill you?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
What's it to you?
You don't seem to understand.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Go.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
Then, why did you come?
Save your strength.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
I went to see a friend of mine.
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Are you okay?
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
I must say I found it rather appalling.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Oh really?
You've read The Fountainhead?
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
How's the water?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I never said that.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Thank you.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You're naked.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
And that's a bad thing?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
I'm busy.
Yes.
Of Human Bondage.
I do.
Lighten up.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Because I'm in love with you.
I have feelings for you.
I think that's for the best.
Why aren't you understanding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
I don't think that bothered him.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Well do you like him?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Excellent.
Just taking your photo.
But -
Where are you going?
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Blow me.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
You amaze me.
Yeah.
What's your problem?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Exactly the opposite.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Where'd she go?
Tell me all the details.
Oh come on. For her first time?
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Why so nervous?
To my triumph, of course.
It's Cecile.
I can't thank you enough.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
I've already told you, she's not home.
I did?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
Did you ever make a wish?
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Yes, daddy.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
They ran away.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
What'd you get for Christmas?
I'm your friend.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
No, thank you.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
I like to see her happy.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Waiter! She needs more water.
There was a sale.
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
No it's mom.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Or if there's a full moon.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
I wonder if he's married.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Holy shit, I don't know.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
I guess you'll find out.
I didn't have to pee then.
My apartment's just such a mess.
It's a matter of life and death.
The Nielson's?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
I really gotta get going.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
Except Mark of course.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
Hello?
You at least owe me the truth.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I'm going to take a shower.
I think I'm a werewolf.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Yes... I... we had dinner.
No, it was our first date.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
You got a dog?
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Not really...
They don't speak English...
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Please, they'll kill me...
What is this place?
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Sorry, sir.
What is that door?
Where does it lead?
No.  I, ah...
Then we must call the police.
Water?
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
What's with her?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Choices???
Nightmare...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Just don't call him, Alan!
Bob...
I was a senator, you know.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
So you want to go swimming?
I don't think so
Choices?
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Will he be alright?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
In the car.
A teleprompter.
What?
This is wrong, Alan!
Fertility beads.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Really?
What?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
Where's home?
How were you gonna get home?
Yes.
I never thought I'd...
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
Ain't no place safe.
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
This stuff really works? No shit?
He is dying. He knows it.
Dios mia.
TONY....TONY....
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
Tricks...Jesus...
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
I don't think they're in school.
Women swoon!
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
At Chet Danburry's house.
What is the point?
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
So, uh, where are you in school?
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Uh-huh.
What is that?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
I didn't know you taught.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
What is this, a midnight study group?
What is it?
I'll take him over mine.
Want to come to the study group?
And now he will?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
I will be with thee straight.
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
No thanks.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Yes.
Who are you?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
What the hell are you talking about?
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Did you clear this?
What other bunch?
I'm not a thief.
What are you people talking about?
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Noooo!
Jesus Christ lady...
You don't have to be so touchy.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Quite a few.
How do you know that?
Looking good...
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Where's you friend?
So?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
Joey...it's okay...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
And what have you come up with?
Man, don't go up there...
Joey...
What the hell does that mean?
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
She fucked us both.
They did not!
What the --!
She does not!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
It won't open.
Fucking A.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Get anything?
Yeah?
Hey, guys...
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Rough, huh?
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
No-o-o!
This is horrible!
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Pow.
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Watch it, shithead!
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
No.
No!
Yeah.
What'cha got, Bennett?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
I want to see my wife and kid.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
Give it to me.
You're working a partner on this.
I'm not voting for you.
Remember my promise.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
You sure?  I can help you.
Yeah.
She's pretty.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
You want to be a good detective?
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
I'm here.
...What are you talking about...?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You never want to find out.
You all right?
Jabez! Careful --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Lying to you -- Why should I?
You know that you're in my house.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Gee -- that Fair --
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Opportunities?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
No, no! Give it to me!
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
About what?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Oh, Jabez.
We can still use my butter money.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Tired?
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I'm serious.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Why don't they come --
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Hullooo!
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
I wanted to give it all to the church.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
It's okay, it's okay.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
The police...?
How about his job?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Bad for your health anyway.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Hans.  Your Hans.
How long?
Yo!
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
I...have a request.
Oh...Where does he live?
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
So whatsa deal?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Don't call yourself fat.
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
So... that sure is something.
What are you talking about?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
What am I supposed to do?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Look... who's on the phone?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
He's makin' threats in there.
What kind of things, Leon?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
What are you doin' in there?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
I frisk you?
He wanted to kill me!
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
He's all doped up.
I want to talk to him.
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Hey... let him out!
What's the matter with you?
It's all we got.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
Are you a lawyer?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
How did you know your son was involved?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
He's gone?
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.

Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Sal?
What'd he say?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
Did it hurt?
What?
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
I don't know.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
God help us. God help us all.
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
Really? Did you play in a band?
We are so fucked.
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
I own a brownstone on this block.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
You the man.
What makes Sammy run?
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Sal, I want my money.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Mookie?
OK.  OK.
Shit!  I forgot.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Feels good.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Be a man.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
I didn't know you could read.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.

That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
What?
Shut up!
You're not my real dad.
Collins is a great man!
These are really cold, huh?
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Sure I do. On one condition.
You can't marry my mom.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
You're always your harshest critic.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Captain Rob came back?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
You certainly did.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
You take her.
That's gross.
So can I come along?
Oh, you're good.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
You had some questions.
Yes, what?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
I'm so close I can feel it.
He passed away three years ago.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
What?
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
Knock knock.
So what do you keep in there?
My thanks.
We felt his presence.
Yes?
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Is he....?
Stop him yourself.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
I have no next picture.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
I didn't feel well...
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
What are you doing?
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Um, okay... roll camera
I don't understand.
It's that easy?
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Dolores, wait!
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Did you find it boring?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Oh.  Okay.
Stop!
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Yes?
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Yeah...?
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
What the heck is THIS?!!
Do they show it?
At what point?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
Yes!
You think she really likes him?
Excuse me.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Sure.
Yeah?!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Yeah.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Right, right...
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Yes.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
Oh God. What hospital?
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
But Al is your husband now!
Hi. Is Shari here?
What is she, at work?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
How much less?
I hear the dog really liked him.
What do you want?!
I know, I ...
So...?
Page three of the Post.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
Everybody's someone.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Why do you do that?
Screw off.
Marcia's living with a singer?
What's the dif --
Me?! That's you!
Hi, Shari.
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
No.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
So what brings you here?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
I did it.
And how did you get in the school?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Yeah.
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
For what?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Yeah.
Can I sign yours too?
You dumbshit!
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
How's the left these days?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Did you talk to Exley?
Lad, may I have a word with you?
This business, Captain?
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
You know him?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Ellis Loew.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Of course...
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
What little studio?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Should I?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Say what?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Why?
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
What about you?
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
No.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Why not?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Something good?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Working whores with squad two.
Brill?
Oh Jesus.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
When can you get it here?
A direct one.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Yes.
What do they have to do with this?
Okay.
Wait.
No shit.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
Jesus!
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
What's going on?
What the fuck?!
That wasn't so hard.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
So what do we do now?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Pardon?
Eight.  Size eight.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
About what?
What kind of trouble.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Did he give you anything?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
Not a very good one, but--
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
He's got his priorities?
Stacy--
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
Was that doctored-up, too?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
What is it?
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
He doesn't work that way.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
What's his name?
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
Good point.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
He's kidding.
Where's mom?
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
Into what?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
Jerry--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Are you okay?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
It means who's side are you on?
Fuck you.
What happened?
We found the originals.
There was a transfer.
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
He had help.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
We don't know.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Then let's assume I don't.
Excuse me?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Actually, you sing.
Shall we be all right?
You sew very badly.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Arabic?
Shall we be all right?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
What kind of photographs?
If I could just see some identification.
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Don't cut me.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Irving Berlin.
Top Hat.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Never heard of it.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Is something funny?
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
What are you up to?
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
Why Picton?
He's gone, hasn't he?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Kip?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
I don't want to waste your time.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
The Empress Death Mask.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Roki has a vivid imagination.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
We're going to die, aren't we...
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
You bought this for me?
To us. To the Mask.
They moved it.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
What's that?
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
You shouldn't have.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Jesus God, it's going through.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
This is big enough.
She's calling the shots now.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Thought you had to use some of these.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
There's more than one?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
All I have is hundreds.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Erin --
It's not about working hard --
And that's what caused the contamination?
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Really?  It makes me sick.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Someone's following me.
What?  Who?
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Morning!
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Nope.  Maiden.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What kind of chromium is it?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Whose number do you need?
You want my number?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
I didn't say that.
I can't leave my job, George.
Thank you.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
Think you could learn?
Someone stole my stuff.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Howls.
Barks at Han.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
We?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Hyperdrive.
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
What about Han?
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
My mind fills with so many images.
It won't get through the blockade.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
What are they doing here?
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
Humans?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
See you in hell, Snake.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
75% power.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Location.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
How do we get out of here?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Is he coming?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Good day to you, sir.
Yield. I have the advantage.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Of Merlin?
Whose son am I?
I want to thank you.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Yes.
But, I'm here.
Rise, Mordred.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Why?
You.
Me?
Very well. Climb up.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
A lovestruck page!
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
What honey?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
Yes.
Here.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Where do you want this?
Want to ask him?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Thank you.
There is nothing.
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Why the math?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
So, what causes this?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
What kind of stuff?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Oh look at that.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Yeah
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
How do you know?
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
You might loosen the straps then.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
Intensely.
In time.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
No I probably wouldn't.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Who's in it?
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...look down in pity...
What're you saying, Charlie?
Just the same.
Well, look at this.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Beasley.
Baker.
What's our friend's problem?
How many?
My brother and I. One each.
Oh my God ...
When they coming in?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
No thanks.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
Says who?
What do you mean?
It's not family.  It's business.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
She'll get here.
Get out of here.
It's not gonna hurt you.
Very realistic.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
November.  '71.
Last?
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
We're gonna be here a week?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Because I can hear it.
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
What disease?
I don't know.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Yeah?
Thrilling.  Both of you.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
This is show business?
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
When?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
That!  You can't wear that!
It's orange!
Come on.
Nine!
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
I said I was sorry.
Hey!
Virgins.
Go ahead.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Huh?
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
Born and bred.
Black.  Labrador.
You never sang before?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Where's egghead?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
In and out.
Like a baby. You?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
All I said was you were good.
You were good.
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Soap convention.
He called her.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Look, if you want to leave...
You don't pick your brother.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Fine.  You?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
You mean if I get sick?
... Thanks.
My place.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
Now what?
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You killed them?
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
What about me?
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
Gone?
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
Im having kind of a bad day.
You see, its like were in each others heads...
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Cmon Jack...
No.
You just said everyone needs something.
Miss me, Jack?
What?!
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
No, I didnt...thats great.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Where were you?
What are you doing?
Why not?
Here you go...
Youre kidding me...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Do what?
She got those shoes...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I could stay here forever...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
You cant go!
Jesus, Jack...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Not by a long shot.
Can I help you?
Of course I did.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Relax, it's casual.
What about his first born?
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
He's made a few changes.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
We had a tough year.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
What's wrong with me?
What do you want, Vic?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
What are you doing --
Then what is it?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
That's good.  That's uh...good.
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I can...make it work.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Oh, I think you already have.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
What is it?
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
And take a little trip with them...
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Doctor...
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Look at that...they're changing color...
What can we do?
I've done all I could with the laser.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
If there's any chance --
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I can't tell you.
What happened?
Uh -- what?
That's it...
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Certainly -
Where is Pancakes Hause?
What?
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
One of us pays the other for half.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Just a general way.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Uh-huh.
Uhn.
You know what a disparity is?
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Yah!
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah, okay.
Okay.
Whatcha watchin' there?
I know it's a lot.
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Yah.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
You're darned tootin'!
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
How's it look, Marge?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Geez! You look great!
...What can I get ya?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
No, I didn't...
Anyone else residing there?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Oh. Geez.
The day of our homicides.
And this guy is...
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Whose car?
...Chief Gunderson?
Yah?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
It's just the three cent.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Yah, I guess.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
This is do-able.
That wouldn't interest you.
You are a moron.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
No.  I found something new.
Yeah, both of us.
Hmm?
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
The dynamite...
Dynamite?
I'd like to thank the academy...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
Should we?
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
This could go on for hours.
There?
Chloe's dead.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
... A person.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
What happened... ?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
... You know me?
What?
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
What?
...no ...no ...
Would that be a problem?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Same here.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Good answer.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
You get rid of her.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
I'm pulling the green wire.
I quit.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
His name is Robert Paulson!
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
You have to tell us now.
You were there?
What about that?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Want me to drive?
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
I'm... really sorry.
That's why I was there last night.
Most kids do, I guess.
I'll remove him.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Wow!
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Ever do this from a jet?
Ninety.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Alright.  Home run.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Black.  No sugar.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
What?
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
No, I'm fine... really...
And who's Lydia?
What?
How have you been?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Yes... I... I agree...
.....Me neither.
I was nine in the sixties.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Who are you talking to Jack?
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Excuse me...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
You're married.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Cerveza.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Is it my turn again?
No.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Just finish eating.
Sure you don't want anything?
Alaska.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
No. We have tomatoes.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
I don't make the rules.
Well, you seem very professional...
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Yeah... I guess so...
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Do you want some gingerbread?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
The day after tomorrow.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Wait...
You think I'm a fake.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
That's right.
Robert?
I have to talk to you.
Will you let me talk to you, please?
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
Well...
Steam.
If you want to call it that.
Look at me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Who are you?
What are you doin' here?
So what you think of me?
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Come down!
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
She lives near Eddie?
How does he look up close?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You looking for somebody?
She didn't say she had no man.
Positive.
You sure?
What?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Not a prayer.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Right.
Margaret.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
I'd have been long gone.
Harry S. Truman?
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
I know.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Cute young thing, too.
I'm sorry?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
So were my parents.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
Hi.
I saved his life during the war.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
Two...
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
How could you call him?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Who's Frieda?
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
You're saying you need money.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
Contacts.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Three hundred.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
This is boring, guys.
This way...
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
So, did you find my dad?
Two words.  Disco Express.
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
That's cute.  You're funny.
What?
Everything is everything.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
It has to be by the end of this week.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Regarde mon pcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire trs froid cet hiver.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
He got off on six.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Why is it called Hellgate?
It was a crematorium.
What I know is what I told you.
So what?
They around?
You okay, man?
You alright?
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
How was your tour?
Where's Johnny?
I love you, Bud.
I'm serious.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
I think you know, Frank.
I swear, Satch.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Deleon.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Where are you transmitting from?
Huh?
What'd you just say?
Uh huh...
What?
Oh my god.
What?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
You sound...ground up...?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What are you talking about?
But that's tomorrow.
Whatta you mean...
I don't know...  What about the other women?
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Yeah, you betcha.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Please, Dad, just do it.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
What?
Got a minute?
Are you a good cop, John?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Going?  How do you mean?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
It's dark down there.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Is that so bad?
What?
Could we move a little faster?
Hi.
I have to.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
What it is?
Daddy, what is going on?
No.  No, it's not...
It's all over.
That's debatable.
But what I get scared again?
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Well, let's hope not!
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
I'm here.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Steven buggin' you?
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
Yeah...
Don't do anything stupid.
Oh, my dear God...
I know what it sounds like.
About Jessica.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
No thanks.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
What are you going to do?
Well...how do you feel?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
You had me worried to death!
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
But I didn't get you one...
Where are they?
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Don't wait Efor me.
Had to be him.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
In and out of bed.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I have a class. I'm late.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
What's sexy?
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Joanne Bourne.
What did it say?
Life is true.
Pop, will you let me in?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
A grandmother. God bless you.
That's a simple subject.
You're a family man, Frankie?
I want to believe.
Mine was cobalt blue.
There was a review.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Yes.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
God gave you ten thumbs.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
What was he like?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
You've done me a great service.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
All right. Fine.
Er, no...
How much extra?
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
What a pity.
That's the last.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Is that all?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Hello?
How the hell did you get here.
Why not?
Hugo!  I've found him!
We were just looking.
Friend?
Of course I think about it every day.
My medication.  I left it back there.
What happened?
What is it?
--when you go away.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I've got enough here.
I get my own help.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
That's your problem.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
You okay?
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
You been okay?
Wait... give me a minute.
Why are you laughing?
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
At least you were outside.
I mean it.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
What do we do?
Why, there's nothing on the news?
You can't trust anything these days.
How much?
No scars?
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Can we make it?
Are we going to make it?
What now?
No, I'm not.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
What do you have in mind?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
What did you do?  Albert?
What happened to this car?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
Jack?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
How were things between you and Frank?
Once a week?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
While he was here. You went about together?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Have another?
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Yeah.
It just would. He was always the same.
What happened to you, then?
Get knotted.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Is he staying the night?
You don't look it.
They came back?
What you going to do?
Are you awake?
Do you want breakfast?
What you going to do?
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Meaning what?
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Still got a sense of humour?
Yep.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
What's that? A hundred?
I'll see you, then.
Mmm...
Eh?
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
No.
He is?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What?
No.
Yes...?
What could somebody get for them?
You're going to steal the leads?
For five thousand?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
I...
Oh, yes, George.
Fine.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
You think so?
That they're going to be upset.
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Excuse me, sir...
Moss...Who told him?
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
You have a problem?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Shelly, you blew the last...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Murray said...
Murray said...
Either way.  You're out.
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
And what if you don't close.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
What are we going to say?
Because I say so.
That's alright.
What are you talking about?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
When?
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Gimlet.
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
To change our minds.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
Yest...
It's not me, it's my wife.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
I...
What...?  Say the words.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
Why not?
Yes.
We had a slight burglary last night.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
To do business.
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
What position did you occupy?
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
We were all upset about that.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
What do you want me to do?
What is it?  Can I help?
I've always taken care of you.
Beautiful.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
Kay... Kay...
What do you mean gone?
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
They can come in now.
And Kay...she's all right?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
This committee owes an apology!
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
How's the baby?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
You would have killed his brother?
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Yes.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What about Michael Corleone?
What's this?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
I accept your generosity...
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
I wasn't going to try anything.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
It never crossed your mind?
You liked it too.
Sure.  I loved it.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
You ever been married, Hanna?
No!
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
We have his note.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
Or would you prefer a beer?
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
No.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Did you kill anyone?
No.  I could have, though.
Does that surprise you?
Ah.  A philosopher.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
You're talking through your hat now.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
What did I tell you?  Listen.
What was that about?
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
I don't know.
Did I hurt you?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
No.  I expect you can't.
Sure.
This is the studio where I paint.
Can that count as one question?
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Fish.
I'm not interested --
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
You want to come along quiet?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
A little family emergency --
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
It's all microchips and shit ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
How's it going -- ?
How you know that?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
You getting my checks ... ?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
We'll take it...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Yeah -
Nah. It's a scratch.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
Call 'em here -- ?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
So I was replaced by Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
What kind of trouble -- ?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Hey.
She's trouble --
You mentioned that in your letters
No way ...
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
So, you seeing anybody?
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Let me worry about The Club ...
This time it's for real?
What -- ?
Some crew you got ...
What happened to Sway?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Which way's out, man -- ?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
What're you doing? What about the car?
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
What happened? You okay?
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Jimmy.
Don't worry about it.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
Where'd you find such creeps?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
What? Come on!
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
She didn't do it again did she?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
Thanks, Chuck.
No, I had to talk him down.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
Chuck, let's go.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
What is it?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
What're you doing?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Really?
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
Half-red, half-black--
--that?--
No.
Good to meet you.
Uh-oh.
Good to see you.
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Seems like it's going well.
Jobs doing what?
He married his cousin.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
--And confuse him--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
He won't be a failure!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
What does?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
You've never been on a plane.
I don't know.
My wife's dead.
When did you know she was the one?
That's right.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
I guess.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Don't give me you line of shit.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
You want to read it?
I used to go with the wrench.
Which one did you take, Will?
No. Thank you.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Yes you were.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
I swear to God.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Do you keep in touch with them?
All right, all right. We'll go.
Want me to take a look?
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Some, a little.
Like me?
At least you have a mother.
No, you don't want to hear that.
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Want to work?
How many men?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
They're all gone--or dead.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Where you think you're going?
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
We gonna live here?
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Ya say we're acrost?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
Got any more, Ma?
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Man bones?
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
What's this?
Morning.
You don't...
What do you do?
--No.
Wonderful.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
That's part of it.
Bad experiences.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
How do you know?
You know where I live?
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
I work alone.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Well?
I don't think so.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
It's a place where religious people--
So what happened to you?
How's that?
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
You sleeping all right in that house?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
I have a way with animals.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Shit.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Yeah.
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Ever think of moving there full time?
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Mom?
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Who is it?
How's everything?
What did he say?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
I don't understa-
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Sounds like something Tom would say.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Mmm. An editor.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No!
You want to go to a movie tonight?
Jude, you okay?
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Let's keep her.
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Cereal.
Mm-hmm.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
That's Razor and Blade.
Oh, shit! He got me.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
What the hell are you doing?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
If I win, you become my slave.
Make it my first born.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
What?
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
You would have looked better.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Homicidal?
There's a new virus in the database.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Never fear. I is here.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Any questions?
Phreak?
A hacker planted the virus.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
What is it? What's wrong?
Hello, operator services.
Just one moment.
So?
This morning.
Is there another key?
Brady!
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Why not?
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
I don't want to look pushy.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
It isn't a man.
How's it powered?
What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
I have a place for that.
Hello?
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
I can't.
Wait a minute here...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
TOTALLY!
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Right.
I promise.
I killed him...
There's nothing else I can do.
What does that mean?
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Mmm?
It depends on what way you want to go.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Yeah.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
We--
Oh, my goodness!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, you would.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No?
Oh.
Elliot!  Don't!
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
But not over me?
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
Lee... uh...
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Elliot lusts after you.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
You're just realizing this now?
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
I know...I know.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
What are you talking about?
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Okay.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
You know.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
What's the matter?
Hey, what's the matter?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Good.  How are you?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Yeah, it was.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
Oh, I'm fine.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Hmm.
Oh!
It's all right.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Take our literature...
They're offering... 
...I was <u>working</u>...
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
Well.  Word gets around.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
...very good.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Yeah, so where is he?
Where was the call from.
...sir...?
He is...?
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
I said how's your baby...?
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
...should love to correct your error. 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
I require...
Where do you live?
We got KittyKat...
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
I came to pay my...
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
...but will that satisfy you?
You're <u>free</u>...
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Then we cannot go.
"Because we don't have any money."
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...I feel that...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
You think you're so...but you're just...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
What are you doing?
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
God, you're beautiful.
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
What are you doing here?!
Veronica, you look like hell.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
Chick-en.
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Perrier water!
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on through.
 Got an A, Mum!
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!
Look, Mother!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
looks startled at the outburst.
Fruit.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Let's go overseas . . .
I'm coming with you.
Are you a dream too?
Your insight is enlightening.
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
It's inside a moving car.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
Must be nice.
What's the occasion?
How much time off?
Yeah? You and who else?
Hello I'm Dr...
Have we met?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
What evidence?
I don't work here.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Wait... what the hell is this...
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
Yes.
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Gale...
He lost a shoe!
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
You didn't?
He's pretty... remarkable.
What about?
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
I'm looking for some perfume.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Sure.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
I found a cent!
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What's that?
Stop knowing me so well.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Did you hear what he said?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
How was lunch?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
I thought we'd be happy here.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Neil, do you mind?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Even better.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Tough.
What?
Lieutenant.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Sing.
I hear you.
That is what bothers me.
She's the King's cousin.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
I stood up first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
The past?
I remember you.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You got me.
On the back it has--
Where will you go now?
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
What will you do?
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
I guess not.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That woman's gonna call the cops.
Jesus.  What is this?
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
We can take it with us.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
What if it goes south?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Yeah.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
Louise?
I know the one.
Go.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
It's mine.  Talley.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I thought they locked you in your room.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Who are you?
I guess we do.
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
I will see what I can do.
No.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Very good.
Lets go, Jock.
Mr. Manager.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
What is it, Paul.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Any luck?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
No, no.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
A car.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.
A little longer, Paul?
Please do not talk like this.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Rutaganda's place?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
What do we do with all these people?
What is this about no water?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Prove it.
Thanks.
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
-- that's the fact, bud --
Price!!
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Fascinated.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
The lockdown thing.
Rewind that.
Oh, no.
Sara...?
Something....happened --
They don't build them like this anymore.
My angel!
What's he doing daddy?
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
The heater's here.
No.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Should I...
You don't think I know?
Maura, what is this!
What was she afraid of?
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
How long will it take!
What?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Every day.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Sure.  Why?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Terri?
Wow.  Thank you.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
JP?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah right.  Look ...
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
What the hell....
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
Wha--
I wanna know...
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
The Hudswinger!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
I'm happy enough.
About seven minutes.
A sawbuck!
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
You're from Muncie?!
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Now, Aim --
Now, Amy --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Ya know, entry level!
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
Awwww, buddy --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Yes sir...
Sir?
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Thank you for waking me.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
Yes -- on the boat.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
I like her already.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
It's my day off.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
And charming?
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
Wesley!
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
What about her?
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
What do you mean?
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
All right.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
What?
Fascist!
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
Your toes cold?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
-- 73
But what?
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
I don't like coffee.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Educated guess.
Yes.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
But not too ashamed.
Flame on, asshole.
Huh?
Major.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Out.
Want some gum?
You're parents at that party?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Charles.
With who?
What time is it?
Communist Viet Cong.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Didn't want to miss anything.
This murder was in the papers, right?
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
What time was that?
We're sure it's hers?
Where you signed this?
What happened at that signing?
They're all over everybody.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
You know I remember that.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Did you love her?
Huh?
I told you I don't remember.
No game.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Oh?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Yes.  Like that.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Ah! You have questions?
Nothing if not vampires...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
I couldn't prevent it.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
I want more.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
And you never cried -
It can't be -
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You know her?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Then my luck would have changed.
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
You're not lying to me, are you?
Yes.
You can't look at them...
What about coffins?
Shall we go on?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Yes.
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
You get any sleep at all?
Ray, I can't...
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Never do that again.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It was one year ago...
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Julie? What's wrong?
What do you mean, Julie?
There was a body! I swear it!
To a great weekend --
Rio de Janeiro!
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Not anymore.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
Can't talk right now.
We'll only be a second, okay?
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
He is exhausted.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
I felt he did not like me.
That should decide it or you --
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
It was, the plague
How do you know what my father thought - -
What if he is?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
She's not too well.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Thea, what's wrong?
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Yes, George?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
What's that book you've got there?
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Well, sure I do.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Yes, you bet.
You want a martini?
He's pretty young for that job.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
All of it?
Pop!
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Well, I don't.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Too young or too old?
You may kiss my hand.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh, Mary . . .
Is it snowing?
I can't wait to get there.
It's okay, it's okay....
We're carrying weight.
I thought you said she was going with us?
What is it?  What's there?
Aren't you off-duty?
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Sean's still out there.
Did you get any pictures?
Is that what it is?
So there's one around here.
Where the hell were you?
Let's get the kid home.
It's good with coffee.
It was bad, wasn't it.
That's great.
What's wrong?
That you were fired.
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Two of them are still missing!
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Where the hell is Air One?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Hang on!
Nope.
Me neither.
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
What Kids?  Who went out?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Be careful....
I thought you were grounded.
Maybe.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
It's Miller time!
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Don't forget you have your brother.
That macho pompous English --
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Where's the rubber band?
No.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Up.
Yes.
Here.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Sounds wonderful.
What's up?
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
I will.
You look like an orange worm.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Some miss all their shots.
That's because I am the shark.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Get ready to go.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
Give me a ride?
He's missing.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
... Massachussettans aren't.
You were great out there!
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Now what's this do?
Take it up.
Don't you dare.
What?
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Five hundred yards.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
He needs a haircut.
Something wrong?
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Turn it off....
Henny Youngman....
You want to try your hand at something...?
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
He heard that.
I never....
Sit down, Ma....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
I have to get this finished.
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
Promise me....
Flies the plane....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
It was no accident....
Where do I pull off...?
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
You're not going to bet it all....
Won't you get in trouble...?
Let me speak to Ellen....
How many...?
You tagging them...?
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
We got it together, Jake....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
What about Carla's gig?
You getting a reading on them?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
You don't like my voice...?
Holy Christ....
I'll do it, Jake.
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
That bad, huh?
Did you like that, Mama?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
The van?
The <u>dogs</u>?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Did I say he did?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Stop it.
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
You don't really believe this?
Ease off, John ..
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
What exactly you doing, John?
Bits.
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
I know what a "witness" is.
Can I see your hands?
Me?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Which is what?
He doesn't need my help.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
I don't want them to arrest you.
You got a warrant for this?
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Is that Margie?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Can I help?
Well, thanks.
Oh no.
Oh tsht. Yes.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
I'm working with you because of that memo...
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
First you gotta tell me something.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
What are you doing with me, Rod?
I understand your anxiety.
You're telling me to dance.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
I'm asking you a question --
I have to ask.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
You gonna get that --
Marcee --
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
I don't see any.
ERRR-IIIC!
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Eric!
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Nothing.
That's him. Thats Eric!
It's not safe.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
They never got that big.
I CAN GET HIM!
You remember the sounds they made?
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Know what this is?
Why?
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Is that kid still bothering you?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Where does it say that?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
How close do you have to be?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
Our chance to do what?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Funded by whom?
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
What?
The door security systems are shutting down.
How many lines of code are there?
But would we get the phones back?
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Oh my God.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
They smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Alan?
Dino droppings?
Hola, Juanito
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Are they heavy?
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I read your book.
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
Why?
What'd I touch?!
I didn't say you were scared.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
I'm a hacker!
You want to put in chain saws?
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
You have a map.
Hello?
I don't know...
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
_Krueger_...
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Oh?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
Uh-huh...
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
Ten minutes...
You work in the insurance department?
Did you?
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
-- You appreciate my writing.
Another one?
I gave it to him yesterday.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
It's what I'm paid to do.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
In a small way.
Was there something else?
I suspected that he -- well.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
I -- I found your jailer.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
Maybe it's true then what she said.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
It's gone out so quickly?
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
It's ... lovely.
Ann ... Ann!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Native costume?
Are you gonna start it up?
What's that?
Yes?
Sorry. 
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
So do I.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
No, that's not --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
Yes.
No, I'm look --
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Most of them.
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
What? This?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Yeah, you got to me.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
What am I supposed to say?
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
How do you know how bad it was?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I better keep looking.
How is it back there?
Someone's been doing all these things.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Well --
I wanted to give it to you first.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Mr. Kramer?
Not particularly.
When is mommy coming back?
Wow!  French toast, really?
When is mommy coming back?
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I'm sorry.
Salisbury steak.
I hate it.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
All it is is onions and gravy.
No.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
See you in the morning light.
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Did mommy ever see this?
Like a principal?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Sustained.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
And would you describe those years as happy?
Did you wish to?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes.  Very much.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Eight, almost nine years.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Is that...permanent?
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
How's the new job?
You've been living here, in the city?
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Yes.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
What?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
It's going to cost.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Sure.
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
But, I am in charge.
Here. We'll collect them.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
I miss my brother.
Will we be in this war?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Ask whatever you will.
Can India help us?
America, we shall see.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
Me?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
What do you think?
Things change, Kundun.
You will not come?
Completely.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
Too young?
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
And what would he do come winter?
Around here.  Yeah.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
And again.  How would you get him on land?
You ready on shore?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Where is he?
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
They could try to tranq him on land.
Guess I finally got bit.
Never been to Maine before?
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Good.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
He's mooing.
You think?
We set?
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
You talk to the married couple?
I got nothing against--
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
With what?
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
What?
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Are you on drugs?
No.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Lecter said a lot of things.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Not yet.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Miggs has been murdered.
Why not?
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
Yes.
Five... so far.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
Why? Do you know something about him?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
I never thought about it.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
He kills w-
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
What did you do?
Thank you, Clarice.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Can we rest soon?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
How did you learn English?
Will you consider that?
Yes. Go ahead.
Dark haired...
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
That is the truth!
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Any powder?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
Sir!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Yes.
Yes.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Go on!
Your suit, Becky!
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
What are you doing?
It hit me!  Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
Excuse me, sir...
And it killed Bo?
Thank you, Martin.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
You got money in this tub?
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
What are you going to do to him?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
How is he?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Like what?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Yes?
Just carrying a bag.
Yeah?
What can I do for you?
The stupid bastards! Count it!
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
So do you know these geezers well?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Well, what's going on?
What do you mean?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Why, what's up?
Right as rain.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I will.
You will what?
You know how much it is, Nick.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
How many feet?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
How the fuck should I know?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
You really want to know, sir?
Please.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
So you knew this young man before?
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Yeah.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
A .45--
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
They fought against the Indians?
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
You own this place?
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Maybe.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
So.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Protection?
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Tell that one, Hollis--
Your mother was a saint.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
Fellas.
Sam--
Well, you hire illegals--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
I never said that.
Not if I can help it.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
And my father?
Okay? He's not here?
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Three months.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Like your story is over.
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
We start from scratch--
I been working on a few things.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
No--
Who is he?
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
You heard right.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Thanks, Billy.
Right.
Why would I do that?
So tell me where Nix is buried.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
So why did you marry him?
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
What did you find?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I wasn't.
And they all came...
What about me?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Are you finished with me?
Shit.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Yes.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
What about?
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
You know Vinovich?
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
Are they all in the business?
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
Why's that?
Yes! Yes!
Swann?  What are you doing?
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You'll do it?
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Of course.
No, its easy.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Oh, for her show?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Yeah.
Yes.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Ok, well... I love you.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
It's ok.
No, what are you talking about.
I don't know what to do.
Its bad for you.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
What're these?
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
What's that got to do with you?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
It's useless...look at him.
You don't want to face it.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Taste this.
What?
So what do I do?
No I don't.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
Can I take your coat?
Sort of.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Nah.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
No.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Mom tell you to do this?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
What's up, Sidra.
I just can.
Oh.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
You don't look half-bad.
None of your business.
What was that about?
What?
What are we playing for?
What's up?
Sorry about your game.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Yup.
Tried calling you a couple times.
Actually, I don't...
A rest?
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Getting there.
You asked me what was missing.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
Then why are you so upset?
You're out of your mind.
So you're gonna bitch up?
No.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Zeke.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Not great.
What?
We were just studying.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Guess he talked to you.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
You came out early.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Good.
Yeah.
Does this sound weird?
It's a helluva disease.
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
What the fuck do you want?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
OPEN THE DOOR.
For what?
You mind if I check things back here?
Yeah.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
Not enough, what do you want?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
No.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
What's up?
What happend?
Is it real love?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
I have love.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
You see?
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
You mind your own bussines.
I need to sit down.
Yeah.
Graduation?
Hello?
Yes.
Not really.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
Yeah.
Right.
...this close...
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
How long...you think?
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
What does it look like?
Marcie.
No.
No.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
No.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
...say it, Jimmy...
Do you know the answer to this?
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
I'm sorry.
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
I can't.
Where will the money go?
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
What would you like?
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
..sorry...
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
I am preparing for a ball!
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
A body.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Three days.
Three days??!!
Hang himself?!
We must stop him!
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
You're a fool!
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
And why are you so glum?
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
D'Artagnan!
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
What is its antidote?
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Your Majesty...
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Sire!  I -- How did you --
The food doesn't please you?
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Who is it?
Mind if I turn out the light?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
No...I'm in some trouble...
I've got a better idea...
Did you have sex with her?
What about him?
What's the bottom line?
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
Why?
Tell me now.
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
You got the message Lecktor called...
There has to be.
He's a very shy boy...
It's not over yet.
Parking permits...
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
I'll see you later. All right?
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
No.
I don't want to know.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
You will tell the truth?
No.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
'Intimate? !"
To yourself...
And you said?
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
No.
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
You going back down to Florida after?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Go on to the house.
Yeah...
Did you get my card?
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Cue the commercial!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Why Memphis?
Go away.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
It is apparently not working.
Are you sure?
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Is he in his room?
You got the money?
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
Dead.  All dead.
I got you.
What do you know?
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
For what?
You -- you're too fast.
The beginning?
How does she know?
What did she tell you?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Tank.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
My name is Trinity.
I just thought... you were a guy.
They're watching you, Neo.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
See who?
Sounds good.
No.
No, all we got is $40.
Riverdale.
No.
Look at her.
Kennedy.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
You got some mouth!
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Hey, shut up.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
What's a'matter?
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Hey, where you been?
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Wha?
Well...
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Take your time.  I don't care.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
I know...I know.
And you could care less --
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
It's for the party, Dad --
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
Paillarde of veal.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Yeah, but --
But what?
Yes, sir?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
...See you tomorrow night.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Hot or cold.
No, I don't --
I'm all excited --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Shall we adjourn?
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Doctor lady make it irey.
My Doctor Lady?
Yah.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Jennifer.
Black.
I didn't know that.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Love.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Oh yes, I do.
What are you doing here?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Yes?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Excuse me?
I don't know.
I love your smell.
And is your heart beating strangely?
Well -- I --
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
We know all that we need to know --
'Love will find out the way'?
I - uh --
That's it?
No --
What do you mean?
Of course.
Joe --?
Yes, Bill.
Can you keep a secret?
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
Truly - uh - splendid.
And more.
Okay.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
About Susan?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
Joe, don't do this --
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Not exactly.
You are --?
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
I'm sorry, I --
I am, this is it.  B Day.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
This one.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
We're all here, Bill --
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
How did you know?
...There's a start for a meeting.
Don't get carried away.
Uh oh --
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
What is it, Daddy --?
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
I'm sorry --
What's the way?
Not at all.
38.
Burt.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't my room?
Who did this to you?
Take the money and walk away!
Why would you do that?
Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
On the house.
What do you want?
There's a dress code?
Are you Teddy?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
This is your car.
Yup?
Lenny, is that you?
Things change.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
You don't know him?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Why?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
My wife wasn't diabetic.
Yeah.
What's your twenty?
"And" what?
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
My end?
Make it 40%.
No.
Died in childbirth, having me...
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Would you find me...?
No part of it wasn't real.
What...?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Verdado where?
No.
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
How will it stand up?
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
What's it say?
Why?
Then what were we talking to you for?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Lotta rich women back there...
Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
For what?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Tell her, Ratso.
They wrong?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I'm going to Florida.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
You bet I do, sir.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
... and taxi fare for me.
The kids? Why are they...
History, man, history. How much?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Tunnel?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Stupid.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Just Erich.
And you?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
What?
What?
Whose?
What?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
What is it? . . . Billy?
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Work, work, work, that's all do
Who got the Frenchman out?
Look, I showed you my badge...
Oh, that's gonna work.
What?
Wait a minute-
You feel anything?
A mistake.
But the power...
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Please.
It's me. Can you hear me?
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
The scent won't last...
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Here.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
What's your new book called?
My daughter must be going nuts.
I'm...
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
Well, I hope you like it.
I DIDN'T...
Perfect.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
You want me to burn my book?
No, just the paper will be fine.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
What about a bee...?
Annie, what is it?
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
Maybe.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
You think he might be missing?
You're still a writer.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
Then don't say it.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Ethan Hunt.
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
You don't trust me.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
What did you think you were doing!
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
And then what?
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Let's start from the inside out.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
You have Bellerophon.
Do I?
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
You knew about Jim?
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
I'm walking.
What?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What are we downloading?
Information.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
That depends.
Like Job?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Jack.  Jack.
Higher.  Higher.
Would you remove your hat please?
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Such a nice ass.
Connection denied.
Try it again.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
Who's dead?
I have no money!
Rita. Pass the wine.
Have I been a good wife?
And go to confession.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
You look tired.
Johnny Cammareri.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
It's temporary.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
That's it.
I'm making you a steak.
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
I'm telling you you can't.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Kinda gaudy.
So. Where are we sitting?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
What's the matter?
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
I was.
No, I'll tell him.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Hi Loretta.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
Yes?
Yes, on the floor.
Seven-thirty.
How near is she to death?
What?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
No.
Everything's different.
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
What sins have you to confess?
So.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Yes?
What happened?
Thanks, comrade.
Will you join me for dinner?
Don't shit where you eat.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
I'm too old for you.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
I'm freezing
Yes.
My God, it's a mansion!
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo.
Through ... We found them.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Yes ...
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
'Tis but a scratch.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
What with?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
By what name are you known?
What?
I'm thirty-seven.
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
Sorry ...
What is the capital of Assyria?
When's your next round?
They cost fifty pounds each!
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Herbert.
Who are you?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
The Prince ... ?
Yes ...  make sure ...
Where are you going?
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
We must examine you.
Well ... yes ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Brave, Sir Rob ...
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
We --
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
There are important papers from --
Nobody has any rights over me.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Do you hunt?
You sent for me.
For Her Majesty.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
Who by?
What does he know about the Highlands?
Yes, ma'am?
I'm breaking no promises!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Well, both.
Just them?
Why?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Again?
Who told them that?
Why not?
There is one other matter.
What do they want?
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Something's happened to them.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
Virgin sacrifices?
You got the schematics?
Dante's Inferno.
What are you looking for?
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
The clock's already ticking.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Of course I am.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Howdy!
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
It will work out.
I...
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's unbelievable!
I told ya.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
No. I can't.
Was anyone hurt?
But it said #12.
No.
But, this could be serious.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Okay... but just...just to see.
What's wrong with that?
I'm not sure about this.
"Before I kill you."
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.
No... but...
No, we don't.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
I just wanted to come here.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
The one of 'em still alive?
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Good morning. What do you have today ?
What's going on ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
I'm listening.
We drown.
He hired you to build this place ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Where are we going ?
What about you ?
Are you Matthew Parker ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
What's next Walt ?
Where ?
Don't.
When will that be ?
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
Well ?
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
Then what do you want ?
Was that the Old Man ?
Thank you very much.
Really ? On a date ?
Yes.
Are you okay ?
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Shut up ! It's me.
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What do you remember about her.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Hi Dad.
Never heard of him. 
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
What are you staring at?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
Hi.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Don't wake up Vada.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Woah, watch it!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
Like what?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Wow!
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Maybe.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
I'm just tired.
Well maybe for you.
You couldn't?
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Let me hold him.
Beidermeyer?
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
What?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
You don't like it?
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Dance with me?
What are you wearing?
Ahem.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
When?
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Why not?
What was my mama like?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Please.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Do you think she is?
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Yes it is.
Who's winning?
He won't give it to me.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Have you ever tried any?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
What are you saving for?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
What's wrong with your eyes?
It's my mother.
THIS!! 
What do you want it for anyway?
But I have my clothes on!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Not true.
No.
You don't miss much.
I've lost interest.
Blood oath.
I have a suggestion...
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
Go figure you.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Two words.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
I was gonna predict that.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
... look good on Kimberly.
I saw the show.
Ex-cuse me?
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Please come, please.
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Quite the little eccentric.
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Michael...
Because I could come...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Grand Old Opera --
You're from out of town?
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Third party?
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Where'd he ever see us?
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
What is a turkey shoot.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Can I help you?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Parts.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Does their hair fall out?
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
When did you start singing?
No, I don't.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Hello.
Who is thin?
What?
Fifteen minutes?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
You know Bill is really mad at you.
I mean...
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
You sure do it loud.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Which do you recommend?
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Divine intervention.
You been followin' the news coverage?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
Who's the song bird?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Do you miss Mallory?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
No fuckin' way!
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
Roger?
And where do you keep Mickey?
Who?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
I can't do that. Five guys.
And me.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Out.
You think so, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
All right, you get out of here, man!
What d'you think?
Where's Wilma?
They say your dad's 'round town.
Name's Duff.
Have anything in mind?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
No. I'm new in town.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
How d'you mean?
No thanks.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
What?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
What the hell could you do?
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Like what?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Good-bye, Frankie.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
How you doin', boy?
She don't look no worse to me.
Okay.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Come on, Will.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Your Raoul?
Easy...
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
What are you talking about?
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Yeah, well it's working.
You've got your orders.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
It's coming.
What about the route to the core?
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
I think you're full of shit.
What is it?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
I gotta know... did it work>
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
It sounds like you.
He projects with neural implants.
...And if I guess wrong?
My God... these people are insane.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Petty good.
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Right. 7:30.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Forget it.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Uhh, no.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
Hey--what are you thinking about?
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
So what are you thinking for college?
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Yes.
Why?
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
Wow - I-
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
I know.
Just what?
Can't you make other creations?
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
It's getting there.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Oh, come on Dad...
I'll kill you now.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What is it - What's wrong?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
I'm not hungry.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Who, Jesse?
What's so funny?
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Jennifer --
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Anything?
Ms. Thompson.
Just until we get things under control.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Science...I suppose.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
I'm in.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Really?
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
What did you say?
So who left who?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Cartwright.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
How are you doing?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
Okay.
Well... how have you been?
I thought I'd give it to you.
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Yes.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Anna Scott?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Do you want to stay?
Da Vinci?
Me?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
Still, not sparkling.
What's your name?
I agree.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Right -- want another one?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
What?
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Why not?
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
How was she?
Fabulous.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Y-y-y-yes...
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes, ma'am.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Go on...
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
Marry who?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Mine, too!
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
I don't trust you!
Don't you have any clubs?
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
He's not!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Oh, yeah...
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Bet!
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
A very large pig.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
You...
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
WAIT!!  Where are you?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Why are you asking me this?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Nice dress.
What?...
I'm sorry.
Hi.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
I can't believe you did that!
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Wait.
Faith, this is my mother.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
But somebody wrote those songs.
So, what's your point?
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Is that bad?...
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Live happily ever after.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
You think he misses me at all?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Sure you did.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Like a detective.
It was a ouija board, remember?
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
You sure you'll be okay?
My God... you're right.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
I came after the woman I love.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
It'll do.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Give it to me my Pop's job
None of your business.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
How would you've done it?
What?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
How do you like that one?
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Wham... .
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
What are you going to do?
Pigeons... .
I just told the Father.
You... .
What I did to Joey.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Well, it's over.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Who is he, Pop?
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
But you've got to listen to me.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
Raise a hand to me and... .
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
I told you lay off.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Give me a double.
So-so, Johnny.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Aw, Johnny... .
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Keep Charley out of this.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Nothing is worth your life.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
What kind of symbol?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
No. No! No!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
Oh, man.
Now that's a really big house.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
Hello, Daniel.
Is that what you would've done?
You're gonna use a ram?
Call and tell you.
Leave it where it is.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Who was the friend?
Hello?
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Let's go outside and talk.
Good luck, Richard.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
You don't act like it.
Uh-huh.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
You won't do that.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Those guys bother you?
It smelled.
Well, does it make sense to you?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
Where?
I don't think we should get into that.
You getting serious on me now?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
I thought you guys were busted.
When?
It's a little late for me.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
What's going on, Glenn?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Gee, I wonder why not.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
You there?
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
I can tell.
You a lawyer?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
It's a --
Technically.  They're separated.
No thanks.
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
You wave back?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
He was that good?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
So what are you saying?
Get me into a plane!
Fun today.  Like old times.
Danny...
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
You were more like brothers.
So beautiful!
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Welcome to the singles scene.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Peggy Sue!
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Yeah. Like that.
Charlie, how are you?
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
What are you doing here?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
That's real big of you.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
Oh, Charlie.
I thought you were...for a while.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Thank God for that.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Oh, you're both so naive.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mom!
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
What are you doing?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I	know what a burrito is.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Did you break up with Charlie?
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
What do they do up there?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
What's his name?
Why not?
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
I gotta go back and do my chores...
Thanks, Walter.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Thanks, you guys.
We're not skipping this treatment.
Maybe you should think about it.
I know that, Charles.
Take it easy, Walter.
Little baby girl.
Nine.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
I've considered that.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
What kind of person is that?
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
I still am.
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Something like that.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
No.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Answer the question, please.
We're going to draw blood.
Why are we going to do that?
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Who?
Since when?
Joe?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Charles...
Don't wanna miss this.
Tell me that was you.
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Power cells.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
What about her?
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Let's just be sure.
Little ratty-ass.
60 years ago.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Dancin' on razor blades here...
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Well? Is it just the pump?
I don't suppose....
One is all?
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Which half?
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Think about that reward, Johns.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Take it.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Yo!
But how long is a day?
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Huh?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
I want her.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
What?
The Hunt Club.
Why special?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
Read it yourself.
With one of them.
Then there is another jungle?
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
He's moving his fingers!
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Taylor! Francis!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
...But what'd she do?
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
I volunteered.
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
I didn't like it.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
You wanted to see me sir?
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Very nice Mitchell turns.
Yes?
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
Not tonight.
I'm sure you have.
I haven't been invited.
You're drinking it.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Certainly not to me.
Is this the best you can do?
Why not?
Couldn't be.
Absolutely sure.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
They'll look for you.
This must have cost a fortune.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Ale. I don't mind.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Is it a crime?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
What does he see?
They call me Jeff.
Sometimes.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Private eye?
What are your rates?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
What's this in favor of?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Could be.
Information.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
How would you know, Brandon?
What are you doing here?
I don't think you locked your door.
That's not enough.
With what motive?
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
You can find out.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Not if it clears the air.
How about Magruder?
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
Yes.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
What went wrong?
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Terrific.
Attributed?
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
And some of that.  Sorry.
Good.
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Who?
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
You're so gross.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Okay, I will.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Not bad.
Hello, Jimmy.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Utah, you copy bruddah?
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
I say when it's over!
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Good move.
They don't go for the vault?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Time for lunch.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Look at you.
What story did you give to Davis?
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Thanks.
What have you got in mind, General.
What's that, General?
Georgia.
He's not really my uncle.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
What's that long building over there?
You've got a lot of nerve.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
You're not from L.A., huh?
Fine.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Right.  So!  In town on business?
What do you like?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
You still mad at'm?
I think it's exciting.
He's good at what he does.
Shush.  Of course you can.
I've never been on a plane before.
I more than liked it.
I got tired of hating my father.
You're packing.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Edward, did you hear me?
What time's diner tonight?
We just did.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Carlos had some great rock.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Looks slow tonight.
'Lo.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
I pray for that.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Couple a hours.
You bullshittin' me?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
But I always eat like this.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Excuse me?
Then why bother curing me?
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Should I be?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Why should that make such a difference?
Who's Guilder?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Where did you get that?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Westley's only faking, right?
Sire.
Rise and report.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Hah?
No one of consequence.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
I accept.
You guessed wrong.
I'm not listening.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
But that's cheating!
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
What???
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
I already have.  Come on.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Coney Island??
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
Liebkind, no!
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Always.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
By the sacred memory...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
Vat?
Where are you going vit the light?
I mean in show business.
We won.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
How early?
No.
No! Of all...
Not at all!
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Of course not. Please.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
What should I know?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Arbogast said...
Sam! Why call when we can go?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
This is the old highway.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
For what?
I can come down next week.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
A man should have a hobby.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
She sounded strong...
That's it. 
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I'll get your bags.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
You didn't find anything.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
You mean he doesn't work for you?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Who are you? What is your name?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
What's that?
That called ... commanded ...
The child!
No?
But what about lunch?
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Meaning what?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Which one is me? The horse?
I am right! I know I'm right!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Let it go.
What do you mean?
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
What do you mean police dog?
I told you he was a sore.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
That happens to be the truth.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
But I have some friends waiting.
You did.
You did miss --
Of what?
Is Rose here?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Buddy, you're just a child.
But Rose...
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
All right, what do you know?
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
There goes Mother.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
He had his hand on her titty.
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
No, son, she is dead.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Of course.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
What time is it?
Is she all right?
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Who?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Got yourself up?
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
You don't know where you're going?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
You mean a farm?
No, you're not.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Illusions, Madam?
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
Rose, you don't have to.
Indivisible and inseparable.
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
She's fine, as if you cared.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
No you can't.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
"A.D."
What about him?
Where we going?
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
There'll be other chances.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Arriving tonight
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
We got him.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
What the hell's his problem?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
The gang's all here!
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
Yoda spoke of another.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
I have felt him, my Master.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Luke.
I'm sorry.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Yes.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Here we go again.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet!
Yes.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
We must have a blow-out.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Oh Brad.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
You know this earth - this person.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Some people are very shy by nature.
Morning after?
...T-thank you.
I always knew you was pretty.
I thought it might be cute.
...Can't do it.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
...Like you?
Why?
Oh, Rocky!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Don't do that again!
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Of wa?
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
...That's an old one.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Sparrin'?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Make your teeth yella --
I like yella teeth.
What?
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Did ya win?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
Ya always in a bad mood --
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Maroon, right?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
No...
Does it hurt?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Hold on a second.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
I don't work in Toontown.
Does this help?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
I'll get it.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Have patience!
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
But new struck cuz.
In love?
Farewell, my cuz.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Where is my Lady's lord?
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Ay me!
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
And so did I.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
What?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
About time!
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Who are you?  IRA?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Do you have it?
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
And more importantly --
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
He's tough, your American friend.
You shoot alright.
They call me Swede.
Eat shit and die slowly...
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
Same thing, isn't it?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I needed to know.
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You would have done that?
What the fuck happened?
Business keeps you on the road?
Would you stop with that...
Let's get him out of here...
You slept with her!
Doing well.  This is?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Sort of!
Oh, you would have done great.
Ten thousand right here.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
At the expense of six people.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
Shhh!
I don't know...
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Here it is.
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
No.  Why?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing happened?
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
You're worth every last penny.
How are we going to do all this?
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Why?
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
About what?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Hey where's the hot pad?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Oh Jesus Christ...
I didn't know you were coming.
Give me the bad news.
There was more than that.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
I said get on your feet!
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Who died?
Not Yu.  You!
Is it hot in here?
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
I did!
No you didn't!
Ricky Tan is alive.
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
What is this?
New York City?
Just trying to make it look real.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
And that, of course, would be me.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
That silly-ass look on your face.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Shortcut?
What plate?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Yeah, it's good.
What?!
Oh my god. Griffin.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
The Feds?!
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
At this point we don't have much.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You sonuvabitch.
Yes.
Yes.
I am so sorry about your men.
I'm not running.
Yes.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Maggie!
Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's running after her.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
I don't think that's why she ran.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Twice...
How romantic.
Give me that!
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
I think so.
You afraid to try?
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Of course.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Yes.
I already explained about that.
Lost!
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
And the church.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Lighten up, wahine.
He's going to be the pastor?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Let's go.
What?
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
-- it was a betrayal.
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Thank you.  I love you.
But he saw you, right?
So I mailed your letter.
What about the letter?
I know.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Are you Annie?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Grace heard it.
Have you had any relationship since?
I don't think I could really describe it.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Does red pepper go under R or P?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Will she scratch up your back?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Bye bye blackbird.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
I can't believe you flew first class.
Hi.
Take a drink. Calm down!
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
This water's cold again.
What?
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
You are no good to me -- in jail.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Be still ...
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Go on. Spill it.
I thought maybe you forgot...
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
What attitude?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
I can't.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
You get off on abuse or something?
Fuck you.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
What do you want from me, Colette?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
I'm kind of busy.
I need my paycheck.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
Colette, go.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
You're going to have to explain that one.
When? When did you ever see me use?
You don't trust me?
If you say so.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
What the hell are you doing here?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
You've got no choice.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Please ... don't do this ...
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
You're lucky, Flynne.
When is the deal going down?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Nervous?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
What is it, drugs?
Don't worry about it.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Good luck, John.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
Shut up, will you?
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
He ain't Wade.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Senator's son?
Pass.
You know classical music?
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Worked, didn't it?
You get a translator, Captain?
Maybe.
Nope.
You think they'll be alright?
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
I don't think so, Captain.
Trust me, you're the best.
Yeah, how so?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
What's the profile?
Because he's guilty.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
What's a scam?
I'm gonna call her.
Yes.
Come on, it's graduation.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd is doomed.
Meaning?
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Why?
Visit her at the home.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Dad.
You're going.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
What happened to you?
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
You think you know what this money is?
What are these?
Have a good sleep.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
What?
You think so?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Yes.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
You're shaking.
You shared it with a dick.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
Okay.
It's your castle, man.
No.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Thanks Lloyd.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
I called her up.
Now you're back.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
You want these people.
You asked for shoe polish.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Better this month than last?
Don't ever do that to me again.
Can't we hold him?
I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Cici. Who's this?
That's okay.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Its over, Cotton.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
But youll never get away with it.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Where's Sid?
He seemed harmless.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
He hates Oliver Stone.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
What are we looking for?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Who is this?
That's not the way we play the game.
Oh--a God complex
Gotta.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Who is this?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Did you request this case?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Hmm.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
What?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Sid I can see you!
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Who's phone?
What the hell are you doing?
No really?
Possibly.
Just because you knew her?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Yes.
How do I know their voices are --
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
I thought she was dead.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Are you serious?
I called my dad.
You don't still think it was me?
What?
You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
That's not what you said.
Dial someone else, okay?
Where are you?
Come on. It'll be fun.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Michael... Michael Myers.
Now for the real question.
But you're doing so well.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Deputy... good evening.
Then what are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Afraid not.
I was first to respond.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
I'll look for it.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
I have no idea.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
Have a good trip.
Stu was with me last night.
She's saving herself for you.
Which is you...
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
What's Leatherface doing here?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
It's past seven.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
I'm not worried.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
I thought you dumped her for me.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
Announcing what?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Already.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
How you feeling?
What?  What?
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Murderers?
A woman...
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Just keep leading the way.
Here he comes.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
Is there any blood in it?
No.
It's too soon for him.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
He's preaching.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
He just may be nuts enough.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Well, that was money well spent.
You got to be kidding.
So they ran our list.
It's not what you think it is.
Are you alright?
We could use about fifty more men here.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Where's the victory?
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Oh, you want to stay now?
I want to have children.  It's just...
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
He cometh forth like a...
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Told ya, didn't I?
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
That's what I said.
Easy on that!
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
What you goin' to do?
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
I think maybe we oughta...
Well, you're a widower now...
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
What's that got to do with us?
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Finish your breakfast...
Do you have a better idea?
We just have to make a new beginning.
I miss Tommi so much.
So do I, believe me.
Who was that?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
She was old.
How did you get me out of there?
I really hate to bother him, but...
But what is the truth?
Hammer?
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
The title won't do.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Follow that boat!
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Yes.
Do you know that house?
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
A woman of property?
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
There's never any
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
It is over.
She is always Aphrodite.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
The show must  you know
What is the story?
"Good morrow, cousin."
Two hours at prayer!
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Your mother, and your father
Your Majesty
And I love poetry above all.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
I have, Master Shakespeare.
The same, alas.
There is time. It is still dark.
Oh, Will!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
My lord.
You flatter, my lord.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Good morning, my lord!
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
He's still here.
But not quite.
I don't know.
Security.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
What? Yes, that's fine.
What's wrong?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Not at all.
But there's no --
What does it look like?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
I think you're lying.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Hugo.
You want me to kick it open?
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
Will you calm down.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Later. But first -- him.
It's about me and David.
Interesting.
Burglary?
Two?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Why do you want a room here?
That's what it cost, David.
What?
Right here?
Working nights?
A certain weakness.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
No. I haven't seen them.
Yes.
Chicken salad.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
-- is that right?
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
George --
What kind of treatment?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Why?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Right.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
You're late, George.
Jesus...
No, thanks.
Jill's coming with us.
Great.
It's hot in here.
And what?
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
-- don't you want to --
Am I entertaining you?
-- yes, you --
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
-- It's Malone's.
No --
So I'm saying it...
Don't leave me...
Oh yeah?
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- how did you get here?
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
Honey?
Okay, baby. Okay...
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
When I get off work.
When is that?
Neither do I, baby.
Jill says nothing.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
How come you took your own car?
Baby, please don't... I love you.
... well I'm glad you told me.
Please!... that's not like you.
Did you?
Thank you.
Sorry, honey, I...
But...
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
I know.
Oh yeah...
What about Jackie?
Wasn't sure it was you.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Is that right?
I am?
Steve?
I'd like a drink.
-- you phony asshole --
Hi, Leonard.
Oh yeah?
Fine.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
Oh. thank you.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
What's wrong?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- I'll get in the back --
No.
Everything okay, son?
Where to, Les?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.
Yes.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Talking to Tony.
Sure.
Delbert Grady.
Who?
A nigger!
She eh... interferes.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Beg pardon?
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
No charge?
What time is it?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Wendy!
Stay away...!
Go away.
Well...
five months of peace is just what I want.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Thanks.
Hi.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Eight thirty.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
What's the money for?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Went shopping. Why?
What's that?
What kind of noises?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
A tracer. You'll like it.
Was it a prescription?
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
There! You see!
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Oh?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
LET THY SPIRIT
Yes, Mary?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Soprano or alto?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Excuse me?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Who are all these people?
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Run!  Take off!
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
And whom would you call?
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
A vote?
You sent for me?
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
He's a businessman.
No nothing.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
I am?
What're you doing?
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
But you didn't tell me!
And if she runs?
Get her!
Yes?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
But, Bishop...
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
You must have missed your mark.
What is that?
... Brom Bones...
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Damn... damn... damn...
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
Out there.  What do you see?
Listen.
I hear nothing.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
Baltus Van Tassel.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What now?
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Other people?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
I insist that you have it.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
People have put their trust in you.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
It was not butchery.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
I have not been able to face him yet.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Where are we going?
You are from the Hollow?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
She did not do it... please listen...
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
All right then.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
You have any biscuits for sale?
Yeah.
It's too big.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
How'd your baptizin' go?
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
What's in your bag?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
But maybe just for awhile --
I reckon I feel all right.
You told me to come by.
They still around, your folks?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Maybe they needed it.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
No sir.
You all right, Mama?
I know he does.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
I didn't aim to.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Why are you here now?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
He just got out of the state hospital.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Do you smell shit?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Better make it charge. 
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Not an easy book.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
What about for you?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Are you closed?
It's yours?
They're all the same.
You're looking good, Auggie.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
Where to?
You what?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Jesus.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It was just a thought.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Thomas.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
Drawing's a good thing.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Thanks. 
The inspiration.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
Yeah, I picked it up.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Oh, yeh?
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Greedy.
Yes.  Initially.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
You're wondering why I held it.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
You wouldn't even see it move.
You want me to say that.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
I believe so.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Can I say something, here?
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Are these your bags?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Why?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Okay. 
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
I think they got me.
My name is Josephine.
Done what?
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Good night, honey.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I have a very low resistance.
I'll carry the instruments.
What do you think you're doing?
We don't have to run.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
This is where I get off.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
And I can never have children.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, we couldn't!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Oh.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Really?
Happy days.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Who are you?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Are you staying at the hotel?
Which one is yours - the big one?
- opening of the Opera -
Oh?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Three?
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
What's on Thursdays?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Have you tried?
Nothing at all?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Anything this time?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
I never join nothin'.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Perfect. All ginny.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
Hey.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
I thought you said you were crap.
What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Hey.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
You shit!
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Oh, cut the crap!
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I am now, sir.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
You could? How?
Yes mam...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
It's cold, Daddy!
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Come, I'll take you home.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Whatcha got there?
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Tired.
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
Will they give him a trial?
Pillow.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
Why the fuck not?
Dude!
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
You're late, Cartman!
Your behind?
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Cartman?!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Oh yeah.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
What's going on, Chef?
Look at that!
Oh no, it's that kid.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
Uhh... I don't know.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Be careful, dude.
It's so very cold...
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Oh dear God...
What about air strikes?
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
I know.
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
And ze rope?
Check.
Oh yeah...
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
It's time we lock coordinates.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Sure.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Well now what are we gonna do!
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
I'm not on the tour this year.
Need some advice, huh.
What do you think I can do?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
The small ball.
What the fuck is this?
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I never saw you.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
No!
What if he wants to get out?
I like the sport the way it is.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
132, 154.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
I came here to have a word with your dad.
What do you want with my dad?
Everything has it's drawbacks.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
He said he'd sponsor me.
Sheila, please.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
You told Junior that we did it.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
I am a professional man.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
It's burning...
Hold on --
What is it?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
What have you been told so far?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Edmunds?
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
It's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
She's not gonna know.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
We had considered it.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
Sir, about leaving --
What was Edmunds doing outside?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Because when we get down there --
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
What do you mean -- not normal?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
You did, didn't you?
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Tarazine?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
For what?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
You tell me.
You're lying --
You manifested that, Beth.
I never went in that sphere.
That's bullshit.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
I promise --
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Top shelf, is it?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
You're staring at me.
What?
Don't be defensive.
You sound defensive.
This answers one of our questions.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Norman, where are you?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
You didn't say that about the food?
Wisconsin?
How do we decode it?
Nine hundred feet to surface.
How's that working out, by the way?
What is it, Harry?
English?
Does this mean what I think it means?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
You want me to try?
Try this one.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
What kind of a crash was it?
No, not anymore.
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Your father will never let you.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
So what are you doing later ?
I'm all ears.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Johnny, wait...
Where are you going ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Why not ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
Sure.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
How bad are you, pal ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Mister Rasczak ?
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Disclose the information.
What does that mean?
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Then you acted properly, of course.
You saved the ship.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Nope.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
I want to rent this one.
Who?
You quit.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
But, but but but...
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
Yes...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
You can do it.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Press still works.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
If I go to jail...?
Drama Group?
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Mornin, sister.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
You have no right to...
But not that <u>way</u>...
...we had a script conference...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
This is Joe White.
Yeah.
Yes, yes, but...
You can't do what?
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
That's cor...
That isn't very nice.
-- she's got 'religion.'
Who got their heads cut?
Doug...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
What?
I...?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
For what cause?
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
They're coming Fedex...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?

She wasn't in...you were al...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
You think so?
Zat true?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
...why do you think?
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
That happens.  To families.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
This'll work, huh?
I don't want to say goodbye.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
This is my daddy's house --
This is my house too!
She still packing for her trip?
That doesn't bother me.
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
Then have a donut --
But you told us to starve.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Mommy?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Yes.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
No.
You have the WORST flu since...
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
No!  I have to get there.
Before you.
But you can still see him.
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Not to me.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
However many.  It's not enough.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
You feeling all right?
Look, you've never liked me...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
So.  Hopeful.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
And her...?
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
You weren't passing 'em out.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Ben never mentioned it.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
They don't hate you --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Rache, it may take time.
What a great surpri...
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
Out! Leave the table!
There are some rumors...
Like what?
Nice to have you here.
I'm still poor.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
But still, you can't be sure.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
It's all about who you know.
You mean, again?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
So? How was school today?
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
One in a million recover.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Gee, you're home early!
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah.
How'd you get it?
I know.
Yeah?
So where'd you get in?
He did?
I said I'll lead.
Forget about it.
What do you think?
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I have a lighter!
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Get your men to do it!
I have your word, Mister President?
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Give that back to me.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Didn't they tell you?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
What is your name, young lady?
Well, Mister President.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
Plan-R????
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
What shall we drink to, sir?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Ask away, Major.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I guess so.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Go on, Major.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Do you think we'd cheat?
To peace on earth, Major.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
How many planes did we lose?
What?
Call them every five miles.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Where'd they get you?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Like hell it does.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
Are you sure?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
I don't anymore.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Mm-hm.
Was it okay?
Uh-huh.
Responsibility, progress.
A cloud.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
No, no.
Jesus Christ.
That sounds so depressing.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No. Life is too short.
What, they're looking for her?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
She's in the van.
Ah, you know people there?
Come on man.
Your his publicist?
Yes! Free concert!
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Whoa!
Yeah!
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
You rich?
He is?
He is.
Yeah. So, what about you?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Really?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
Oh, sure.
We were?
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Who were you talking to?
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
No.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
No.
Jeff, stay there.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Like what?
Hey!
It was a racial incident.
So what do you wanna do?
My goal is to make art.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
No, no.
Yes, you do.
Mm-hm.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
For a ride.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah.
Yeah, really.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Is that your driver?
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
Yep.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Is that Jeff?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About what?
Could you give me a ride?
I'm in, too.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Hello?
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
That you?
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
Uh...maybe?
More proof God's a guy...
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
Thanks.
Thank you.
You'll be waiting for me?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Why not?
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
Hello, Betty.
Hers.
Her own movie theatre.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
And you'll play Salome?
This is fascinating.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
What month?
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Don't bend back like that.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
You think this is all very funny.
What's that?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
That's what I told them.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Eliminate her.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Whatever you say.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Maybe it was just an accident.
Like it?
What's that?
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Away. From you.
But why?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
Can I give you a lift?
Someone's chasing him.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Where is Earth?
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
No, MR. Danvers.
A cheap trick.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Goodbye...
The kid needs a man to show him --
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
But Lana, you could --
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You thought that?
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
Kent!
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
So where is all them half-centses?
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
First question got to be "Where."
And then shut down the pipe lines.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
We back in Metropolis?
What about me?
What about you?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
I can't see anything.
Turn on the light.
Gus?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Missing????
Small potatoes.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Lois, what are you doing?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
I was right. you are Superman.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Hi.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
Everything on it?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Gee. But --
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
He has powers as we do . . .
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Yes, but will you honor it?
So this is the planet Houston . . .
You are master of all you survey.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Impossible? Why?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Yes, darling?
Is he for real?
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
Who?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
What's he going to say?
But why the hair?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
He's . . . cold. . .
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
We'll all fry.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Bunkers!
Lois isn't here?
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Know what?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
What now, my love?
Oh.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Jealous? Of what?
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
What're you writing, Lois?
Gets you where you live, huh?
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
How good it felt!
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
It must feel great.
How old are you?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Very much.
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
I still don't get it.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Luthor  --
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Ally.  That's right.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
I...don't think so.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
I understand.
I can help you.
Case?
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
I have to.
About the Ottos?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
You want a cup of tea or something?
What happened to summer?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
How was it?
Did he say what about?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Here we go.
I'm in a car wash.
So what's the problem?
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
Oh God, I'm scared.
What is it?
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
No.
Are you a reporter?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
You remember this?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
The door needs a lock.
Great.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
I don't know.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Alone or surrounded?
He's somewhere...
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
See my mother?
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
No, I wouldn't...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Can I come in for a minute?
I know Manny Davis.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
In his apartment -
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
What would you think of me if -
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
I'm used to you...
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
You haven't told him yet...
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
You going to work all day?
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Do you know about the chip?
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
No.
Pain causes it?
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Remember what I said, you can't...
Is it dead?
No!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
Eating is eating... and...
I guess so, sir.
So, what does the Russki want?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Colonel. Pleasure.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
No can do.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
No. Ours was damaged.
I can't do this. It's not right.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
May I ask a question?
Why were they going to arrest you?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Who?
And what was that?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
And what did he say?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I have illegitimate children.
Helmuth.
Show you?
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
He did?
The Miracle Kid.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
What about it?
That's not my mission.
And who was the enemy?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Why?
Why were the other two women killed?
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
The stock will turn.
Are you finished?
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Don't just stand there, get help!
Alright... okay...
If there was one.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Can we talk?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Well... the red bra.
Get out.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Claire.
I have to get to the airport...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Big family... small?
No.
Are you still on mediction?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Yes.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
And if nothing's lacking?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Guess!
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Did you worry about him?
What's the trouble?
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
What gentleman, Maria?
Attractive...
Just what I told you.
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
All the carvings.
Hmm.
Are you coming to confess?
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Yes.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
Fifteen dollars.
I don't know what to think anymore.
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
I don't think I want any.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Why?
Italian?
I like the colors.
What's the matter?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Fuck you.
Huh?
Yeah?
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Y'what?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
She didn't write to me, did she.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What post office?
Not much -- you?
Didn't get it.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
Something like that, yeah.
That's what was estimated.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
Hey?
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
What about your grandmother?
He alive to see this?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
How far?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Been away a lot.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
What d'you mean, any happier?
Something's on.
You know I don't live with him.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Yes?
Who?
Hello, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Ah yes, a music lover.
...she can go up there.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Huh.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
Cash.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
...Ed, I...
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
...Huh?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Dave.
So?
...What's so damn strange about that?
Should I... should I tell you why?
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
It was Big Dave's.
So... who... who actually--
He a good man?
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
...Ed?
Uh-huh.
Yeah--
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
Homicide.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Anything missin'?
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
Behind you.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
What's left of it.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
What is it?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
How many storage areas are there?
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Not that big.
They've got something.
Jesus, what is this?
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Maybe not.
A monster?
Then it won't go after the others?
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
Close up?
All prop cars accounted for?
We're not watching the sea.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
The memory of who?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
I've got to talk to you.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
How did it go today?
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I made macaroni.
Oh, my God!
You hate gambling.
Truman, what about that sign?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
How are you, Mother?
--Darling--
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
How can this be?
Have you examined them?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Before the bomb went off?
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
I think you're full of shit.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
That would be my guess.
What's wrong, Scully?
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
How's that?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
All I told them was the truth.
You're... quitting?
What are you implying, Scully?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
You think they went left?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
Yeah, well they may this one.
Been where?
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Scully....?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Where are we?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Are we being watched?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
What's wrong?
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
Why'd you bring him here?
COME ON!
That went well.
He's mine?
You liked him?
Already there.
Agent Novak.
Awaiting his arrival.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
I wish I knew.
What happened to your hand?
...is there?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
That's his headache.
Why are you lying?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Where's Harry?
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Listen, Callaghan.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Bring him in.
Well?...
Of course.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Shall I go over there, sir?
Mr. Crabbin.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You told them, didn't you?
...you.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Could he have been conscious?
Yes.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Okay.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
I don't know - I'm American.
Everyone ok?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
It's on an island that no one get to.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Two.
Not too bad.
So from there to there?
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
Watch your language....
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Why no silencer?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Why won't you talk to me?
When can I see you?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Why?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
You wouldn't announce it?
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I always won.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
You're lying.
I don't do that.
What part of Germany are you people from?
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
This will be a different kind of device.
Who even knew?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Are you an artist?
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
So what?
We tested the new bomb.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
No.
Well, good night, then...
... It's a comfortable place.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Roberto?  How long?
Madame...
No.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Why?
Anybody can have a bad day!
... I was right about what?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
... Not at all.
I didn't dive.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
... Are you sure?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
In my apartment?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
... And those?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Wait!  Professor...?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
So. Do you have a name?
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Any sign of Santa?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
So, how was I?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Sure!
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
Who?
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
It's about the leopard.
Yes?
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
To the eye? Like other men.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Wait 
Go on foot.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Clo-Clo?
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
And that is the last time any...
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
What... What are you talking about?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
When did you get back?
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
Leon hung himself.
Leon could still have hung himself.
Should I?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
What...?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Hi...
Im calling about the puppies.
Have we done business before?
May I have your phone number?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
On the bed!
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Ever seen him before?
Where are we?
And who does Friedman work for?
What company?
What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?
B-Black...
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No.
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Your secretary, huh!
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
The 1,000 is on account.
Five to three. Youre early.
Have you?
An Austrian.
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
Whats the date?
Uh-huh.
Quest-ce que tu veux?
The acid bath?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Now?
Well...
What... what do you mean?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
No no, I'm fine, really...
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Not long ago...
What were you doing when the voice came?
You will??
You did well...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
5,000 gold crowns.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Well...?  Shall we go?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Jeanne, look behind you.
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
I don't know... I thought...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
They won't come anyway.
Yes... lots of things!
What signs?
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Him?
Who is this "he"?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
How long have you been married?
I'm on the run!
Tough luck.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
I know.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Yes, but what good did it do?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
What about you?
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
She looks tired.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
You'd have to organise it up here.
I don't want to learn.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
It's my mother's piano.
We can't leave the piano
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
They workin' for anybody?
They're still looking for him.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
You just worry about your end, kid.
What do ya mean?
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Looks like he's sulking.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
See and raise 1,000.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Why not?
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Don't cry.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
He wouldn't say.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Where did you hit her?
She fell down.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
This gun yours?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
No.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Get anything?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
I didn't know they had a fight.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Well, let me do that for you.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Hello, Mimi.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
I had him out this morning.
If you like 'em like that.
No.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
Finished with these?
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
You talk as if I were Asta.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
It was his body that was buried there.
Couple of months anyway.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Who do you think did it?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I hope you're well.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
I'm sorry...  but...
I'm fired.
Turn the car around.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Ready?
Maybe I do.
You said he was a deserter.
I out rank you, that's why.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
We're not going to do anything.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Wes might be right about that.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Just let me rest for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Can you ride a horse?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
Well?
How do we do that?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
What does that mean?
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Jaeger?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Yeah!  Yeah!
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Stress category.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
What did you get?
Now?
I've never been under the table before.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
THX!
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
We're leaving.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Well?
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I'll report you.  It's....
What kind of answer is that?
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
She's not there
Where's LUH?
No...no you're wrong.
What do you want?
And you are...?
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Just do it.
How long are we going to stay?
What?
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Computer device?
Then why tell me?
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
He is!
Mike...
Goddamit, Reilly--
Yes, sir.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
So you lost a handbag, madame?
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
No!
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
No, not at all!
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
The tennis player?
No--no.
Thank you!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
The pepper, too?
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Gaston Monescu.
What?
Ah!
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Now, Lily--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
But, Lily--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
You know the main staircase in the opera?
I know that niche.
I remember.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Um-hum ...
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
I <u>must</u> go.
Yes, Gaston?
And you expect me to believe that?
Lovely.
About what?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
That's true.
No--I'm sorry.
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
The ship will sink.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Something serious has happened.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
She had beautiful hands.
And...?
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
What is it? A sapphire?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
This is horseshit.
I promise.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
I'm sorry.
Rose, get in the boat!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Oh--a hundred times--
Feeling a little better, I see.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
You'll excuse me. 
Will you pardon me?
What did you want a gun for?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I'm so sorry!
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Where have you been hiding?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
A little.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Sally--!
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
Lose?--I won a little--
You can live that down, can't you?
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Nix, the law!
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
I thought you were a sucker--
That goes two ways.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Hello, young fellow!
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Knots!
Everything O.K.?
Do what--
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
So what?
Eh?... Oh.
The country boy's about due.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
"Smooth's" the word.
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Let me look at it.
Not now.  I don't have time.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Come and get him.
I want them spitting blood!
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Yeah, you look it.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Very instructive
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Colorado's closer
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
'Least you admit it.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
I don't like it.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Morg, use your head.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I see.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Is this another one of your games?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
... Kids?
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Are you listening to me?
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Sleep well?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
I am. What do you want?
I was an attorney!
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
No -
How is it now?
Approaching the first gate.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Now how far would further out be?
Your feet are cold.
Just stay in bed and rest.
It's good to be able to hear that.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
What happened to your hand?
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
What's the problem here?
Hattie is a different person now.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Next stop...
Where was the last place you left him?
But what if we leave them behind?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
What are you doing over there?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
According to my nava-computer, the --
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
But why would Andy want me?
Ha-ha!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
B-3.
Did I get my package in the mail?
Hey!!
No she's NOT --
Oh, no!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
What the heck is up there?
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
I got it, Woody!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Woody!  Speed up!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
H'm?
Everything is gone, now.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I was just waiting for the right time.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
Me, too.
Why?
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Is this bad for him?
Hi.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
So does half of San Diego.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
I don't know, sir.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
An informant.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
But will he be house-trained?
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
She hasn't called you?
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Like you protected Landry?
I'll get there as soon as I can.
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Shag her senseless.
I'm going home.
Great.
Right. You can't sleep here.
Come on.
Yes.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So why have you told me about it?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Do you recall the school motto?
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Who wrote it?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Roald Dahl.
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
What?
He made me lick it.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Fuck you.
I can't believe you did that.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
you'll need one more hit.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Six weeks and no sex?
So what's it going to be?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
The ship....
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Your vision?
No special conditions?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...


Borgus Frat.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Each man's pain is unique.
I don't understand...
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Senior exec.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Come on in...
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
I'm your program?
Flynn?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Well I want to communicate --
Alan!
Did we make it?
How about you?
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
You think we can make it there?
That's all going to change, Yori...
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
That's not true, honey--
Dana, are you listening to me?
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
It can't be.
I still don't believe it.
But you didn't.  Why not?
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
What?
Yes or no.
17 years.
Did you pork her Harry?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
You working on someone right now?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Get going! 
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
We're going to Paris?
I don't know.  I have to think...
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Tell him to look through it.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Would you like to get some pie?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
I do.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
What?
You don't know him -
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Why Cancoon?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
I'm hip.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
No thanks.
The zoo.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Look, Dick, I don't -
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
What makes you think I would do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
No.
Uh-huh.
McTeague.
Uh-huh.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Wake up, Cole.
Him?  You saw that man?
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
I need to go now.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
I have to go.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
No, 1995 is the past.
What?
No more drugs.  Please...
"Never cry wolf!"
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
What does this mean to you?
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
JOSE!
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
You really want to know?
He's been tested for drugs?
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
You want something?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
Yep.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You son of a bitch!
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Open up!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Taking a little trip?
Who was that on the phone?
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
It's Grace.
Yes, I have.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
All right, Grace.  No more games.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You love him?
I don't know how.
Have you ever been there before?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
What?
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
But I want to say with you,
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, throw me the keys.
Husband . . .?
A lot that means.
Accident.
I'm a solid man.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Nice office you've got.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Make it twenty.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
How much could you get?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
You didn't kill her?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Yeah, well, me too.
Trouble with the car again?
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
What happened to your hand?
I've had time to get over it.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
You're fucked.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Senor, you need a doctor.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no!
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Maybe I do.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Mister!
Now, what's this?
Who the hell is this!?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
What the fuck do you want?
Accident.
An overheated car.
Live there?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
What happened to your hand?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Harlin around?
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hey.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Don't look like nothing.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Darrell.
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
You're not from around here, are you?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
But I thought --
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Hope is a four-letter word.
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
Why's that?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
You got a beer?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
I axed you a question.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Is Noel in?
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Okay.
Yes.
I've come to a decision.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
You've never been sick?
What do you want?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
I'm going to work out.
No?
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
He didn't say nothin', huh?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Your wife?
Alive?
Hit your finger, huh?
All week?
You could run off them two cowboys.
I could run off them whores.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
But... if he doesn't miss?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Ned's share?
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
No.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
Did... you... get... him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
I can't see 'em.
Wha... what f-for?
Lemmee see it.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Eleven.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Shit.
Yeah... you said that last night.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Who's he?
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Say, Ned... ?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Yeah?
I don't get it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
I love you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
Then who goes?
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Don't hurt me.
What is it Keaton?
Keaton, I can't just -
The answer is no.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Then why didn't you help him?
But Keaton...
He wanted me to live.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Yes.
And no one will know the truth.
What does it mean?
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Anything special about the case?
Thank you.  When Debby...
We went to Code Blue...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Nothing further, your Honor.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
They lied.
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
... that's all right.
It's all right, Mickey.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
The Doctors were not negligent.
...I made a reservation at...
...What difference would...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
I didn't do too well for you.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
) I'm sorry ...?
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
I understand.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
...things change.
I need an extension for my case.
Ready, your Honor.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
What?
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Yes.  Price...
Missus...
D'you find an apartment?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What happened...?
Isn't there something you...
And what makes you so tough?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What is that to you...?
Thank you.
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
...I have to stand up for her...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
What the hell are you doing here?
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yeah.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Yes.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
Almost a year.
Would you like a drink now?
From whom?
I didn't mean to be that rough.
How can I see her, to know her?
Yes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Did she hurt herself?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
Just let me talk to you.
What do you want to know?
Your name. And --
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
They're none of them right.
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
Yes.
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Can't you see?
Some money.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Why am I here? What happened?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
One shouldn't live alone.
How old?
No... it's in shadow.
I know.
There's a name on the gravestone.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
Go on.
Why?
Madeleine --
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
It wasn't your fault.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
I think I can lick it.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
I've told you enough.
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
Mm. Better.
Yeah.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh... this and that.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
But you said grey, sir.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
We can't do this.
How do you figure?
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
What does that mean?
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
Later.
There is no candy!
Real times.
Don't ever stare him down.
I know...
What.
I got you.
Don't sweet lip me.
She's not here.
Where is she?
So who's the lucky guy?
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Oh God. This is insane.
He's cracked up.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Your ideas never work out.
What's your point?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
This is ridiculous.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
Charles Moore for instants.
Of course.
With all my heart.
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Honey I don't have the time...
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
How late?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Do you love me?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
You did all right dad.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I think so.
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace?
There.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
Right.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
What's that?
Which couch?
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
You must think I am a monster.
Unfortunately ...
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
You're lying.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Nothing.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
Leave him alone.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
She's left.
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
Don't talk like that!
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
Have I slept long?
Today, a good girl.
How did you see me?
In English, please.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
What about them?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
I haven't been working on anything.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
What are you doing?
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
What's the problem?
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Come on.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
We're going to have to explain away the...
<u>Do</u> it...
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
...the... 
...you want us to go to War...
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
What did Albania ever do to us?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
The Hostages...?
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Get on this, right now...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
How long you been up, you need a nap.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
Pride of a job-well-done...
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Why do people go to war?
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
How much...?
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Why Albania?
I never won an Oscar.
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
...that's what it is.
What do we have that they want?
The War ain't over. 
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
No, I didn't think so.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
Watch me.
Deal's changed.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
Oh really.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Coulda been a contender.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
...Got a 100 on me, you...
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
Another cup of coffee?
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Excuse me.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
He did?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
And uh, your nicotine sir
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Then why do you still like her?
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Of course you will.
What do you mean?
Did you?
What?
Then why did you?
What does she look like?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
At the party.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Tell me.  I can help you.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
This fence...it's so...
I wanted to apologize.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
She never mentioned her father.
How you holding up?
Yep.
Seance.
Jody, no...
What?
Sit down here.
It's alright.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Okay.  Okay.
Why?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
I think three...
Not the focus.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
That's not what I'm sug--
Did you call the police?
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Well, that's nice.
Oh, no...
I'm so sorry.
Did you tell her?
See?
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
But then you've been so much better...
Do I have everything?
I...
Stop...
...Please stop...
I take it your not mad at me.
Claire--
So you fucked a student?!
We don't know that for sure.
We have to get out of here.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
Adamant.
Do you know it?
With his hands!
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Who is this...?
Who the hel1 -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
Eighty million doll --- ?
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
FAST.
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Lie...?
It is from love.
Only you...
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
HARDER!
All I meant was -
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
That's GREAT!
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
He's got great hands.
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
So what do you do?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
How long have you been watching me?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
Where are you going?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Just put it in my room
I thought it was you - how are you?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Dr STECKLER?
See? Did you see that?
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
Yeah? You like?
Do it?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Finally, some gratitude.
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
I miss them, too.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
I didn't forget.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Your article sucked.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Wow...you clean up nice.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
He didn't. He had it built.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Tell me more.
Maybe someday.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Well? Surprised?
You promise you'll finish school?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
I'm warning you.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
Really? You'd do that for me?
My parents? What do you mean?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
It's our job, Gloria.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
It's those rocks, up there.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
You, Kelly, Sam.
The one you bought at school.
But she ran away.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Didn't you see her this morning?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
All that jumping and kicking.
You might have mentioned you had that.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Not again.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
Hey...!
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
They look like acorns.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I do what I'm told.
Who is that girl, anyway?
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Who are you!  Who are you!
She needs to be changed.
Talk!  Say something!
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
John, why?...
I saw him.
He was... like him.
Are they going to kill you?
Who else knows?
Just us.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Whacking?
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why would they murder...
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Only the elders.
Your husband's?
We had some lemonade and he left.
You know carpentry?
What else can you do?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
I hear you.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Everything okay?
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
My son is out there!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
From now on you'll be history
...have you come back?
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Hickory!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
...Toto, too?
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Oh, no -- no!
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
We might.
And him a brain.
Oh.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
They're coming back!
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Oh -- Oh --
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
What if it were a brontosaurus?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
And you're going to lead us.
You don't get around us that easy!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
What the hell are you talking about?
Whos she?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
...yes?...
Old friend?
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Who is it?
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
I cant stay here.
No. Youll be safe here.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
He used your exact words.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Now...where were we?
Wheres the sub going?!
The Maidens Tower.
How appropriate.
Warm.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Don't call me that.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Blake?  Dead?
I could stay and go.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
I won't do that.
What -- am I --
Its very strange.  Times flowing backwards . . .
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
His . . . whatever.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
No comment.
Their real names, please.
What does this mean?  What does it --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
What do you have?
How will you fix it?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Hey, you're good.
What are you?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
Toadies right behind.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
You know, you --
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
He takes himself seriously.
The intention of registration act -
What do you want?
Where am I?
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
Where are we going?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
How?
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Oh, shit.
And who might you be?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
MMMmm!
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
And your passport?
Promise??
Darling!?!
What a strange fellow.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
What?
I didn't do that.
One week at the most!?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But, sir...
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
I thought you wanted to.
Wockers with the knockers???
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Did you see anyone else down here?
Could be worse!
Why?
If you like -- just hurry!
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Inga, wake up!
All right -- give it to him!
I think so.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
Yes, I know.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
How do you know they're done?
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Food!!
Foooooood!
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
