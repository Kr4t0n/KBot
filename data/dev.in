You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
You got something on your mind?
Have fun tonight?
What crap?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Queen Harry?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Why?
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
That I'm used to.
You know French?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Assail your ears for one night.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Hey.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
That's never been proven
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Why 're you doing this?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
So what's your excuse?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
You up for it?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Wait I...
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Is that right?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
Right.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
Touch of the flu.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The Judgment is ours!
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
My letters of appointment.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I'm not bargaining!
Say not here!  Cuba!
To bring the word of God.
How can you be so certain?
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
How long?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
You think I don't know that?
The land is there.  I know it!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
No.  No way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Who do you think, Chief?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Mind if I ride along with you?
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Yeah.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You're ruthless.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
That's unique.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Ready?
Okay.  You ready?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Where's Czech girl?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
How much money are you carrying with you?
We are both from Prague.
Two weeks.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Did you hear what I said?
What is it?
No, I don't get that!
We spent it!
As a plumber?!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Well, he...
No.  Go ahead.
Well, he killed my partner!
I'll send a cop back for you.
Yeah?  What kind?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Aren't you tired?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE

Sure, what is it?
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes, I thought so.
Well, that's something.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
What is it, Hal?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Certainly.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
That's true
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
I hear you've got visitors.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
This prison gives out $400 suits?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Now, where we goin', convict?
Well?
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
That was in style a couple years back, man.
That was quick.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
That's what you say, Cates...
Billy Bear...
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Call me later.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Hello.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Stall.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Let her go.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Give it back.
Corn-i-Lius?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
So you do know her.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
We have to save the world.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
How many points you got left on your license?
Hello?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
So, just how big was this fare?
Hi Ma...
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
You little sleaze bag!
You have nine points left on your license..
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Where have I heard this song before?
Don't you open your messages?
Love...
Which one?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Actually only one cell survived..
I want your best man on this!
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Am I disturbing you?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I love you.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
What you see is what I got, mister.
You brought the money?
... sorry...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Why don't they come to me?
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Who is this.
Who is Machine?
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Do it.
Don't think I won't.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
You are a private investigator?
Shut your mouth and drive!
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Interesting theory.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
What's next?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
My condolences.
No.
Okay...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
I don't know.  I think so.
Who is this... ?
Do you know what happened to her?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Then what else can we do?
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
I don't get it.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Feeling better now?
You just stay put.  You need rest.
What do you mean?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
About him?
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
But if they <u>do</u>?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Huh?
We're stuck tight!
'Us?'
Yeah?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Course and speed?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Right <u>at</u> him?
But - what can we accomplish?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Yeah. I know about that.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Oh.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
I just think you used to be bad.
It's fun.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
What's the hurry?
You mean Twombley?
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
I won't. You interested?
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Did you get his number?
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Of course! I would've heard.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
You remember Margie Fogg?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Twombley.
You think Jack shot him?
How was she?
Who?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
It's cut.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Yes, Mr. President.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
why did they do that?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
I know he left you behind.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
What's going on?
Yeah, right.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
You give me ulcers.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
Yes I did...
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Who's that, Ted?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Elaine.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine!
Elaine, what's going on?
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
I guess this is a first for you.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Yes.
Striker.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
No.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
And that fits?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Back off, George.
I believe he is probably lying.
Yeah... I know the routine.
To the... to the beach?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
... It's Harcourt.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
The human?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
Still nothing from the colony?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
We got problems.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Thanks.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
A Turkish brothel.
What?
Don't bother.
No, she's fine.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Now?
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Eat
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Why not?
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
What for?
But! I'm a married woman!
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
I was at hand.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Oh, yes.
Gertrude!
What a strange young man.
What a charming idea. May I see?
A-flat, Majesty.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Sire.
Why not?
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Majesty!
What? On one hearing only?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
I have no idea.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Do you always live like this?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Yes.
What's that?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Well?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Madame.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Love, Sire!
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
I can't say. Really
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
With all my heart, Mozart.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
Shall I answer it?
Who?
What?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly. A dance.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
No, but I'm the best.
Who is on this committee?
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Mozart -
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
All Vienna has heard that.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
Oh my son, my poor son!
Exactly.
Are you absolutely sure?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Herr Salieri.
Yes, Doctor?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
What shall we do?
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
How is that?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Twenty-eight.
Hello. You all right?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Charming.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
I've left those pills for you.
I should be committed.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
He all right?
Has he been refusing food?
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Some, everyone does.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Lunatic?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
You're talking about the woman I love.
Hello.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Yeah?
It's moving.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Thanks a lot.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
You're not real.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Get out of here, Jack!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
If I was still alive, I probably would.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Because this must be stopped.
No, thank you, Doctor.
You were saying?
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
No kidding?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
know, but
What is?
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Good morning.
I don't know.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Mr. Dickson?
Yes, sir.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
I already told him I was home.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Hello, Helen!
Oh, ten dollars
Yes.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
What time was it?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
I ain't done --
Damn!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Not now.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
What the --
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Of St. Louis?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Where the hell were you?
Boys...
That just might work.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
You shouldn't be up.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
You didn't want to farm?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Don't turn around.
What?
Last February?
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I guess so.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
THEN WHO DID?!
Your men knew the risks.
With my money!
Stop it. I'm...
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
I know. Stop it.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
You like it there, don't you?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Pull out.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Take it off.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Patrick?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Is your Evian spiked?
No-I can't take the time off work.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Where are you going?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
SHUT UP!
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
Hmmm.
Oh.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
I've questioned him.
Yes.
He does? You're sure?
So who was he with?
I lost my job...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
It's...it's...all right.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
...But?
When's Brian coming for the TV?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
What?
No.
Right... What's that mean again?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Okay.
You're interfaced with our dish.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
I heard what happened.
You look a little tired.
'Have a look?
You could've handwritten it.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Cool!
Did you wanna be alone?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Time?
What'd he say?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
What d'you mean?
So how'd you like the house?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Is it about my teeth?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Good luck, Austin.
We won, Austin.
Yes?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Be careful.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
Are you crazy?
What are you saying, son?
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Dr. Evil?
An evil petting zoo?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Did you ever...
Really?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
Knight ...
Black...
Secret ...
Have we met?
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
An unholy trinity ...
I'm already married ...
And just what is the game?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
June, July ... August?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Why should they think that?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
For you, Mrs. Peel.
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Where am I?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
What kept you?
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our chaperon.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
I shall need a small plane.
Global warming?
Anyone particular in mind?
Guilty until proven innocent?
You with Mother or Father?
Rules are made to be broken.
That's what we're going to find out...
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Man, you're losing your audience.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Five thousand dollars.
I love that car.
Maybe it had something to do.
Hello?
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes I did.
Nice shot.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Good...
Why is Cole here?
Great bathing suit.
What are you talking about, asshole?
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
So, Larry, how have you been?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I just want to be alone.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Ha, ha, ha.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
No, Brett, I...
What the hell is that?
Hey, you guys...
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
My Debbie?
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Is he...
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
It doesn't go like that.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
I'll handle it.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
When I was twenty.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Hey.
Thanks for the invite.
Then why did you quit?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
I want another shot, Sir.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
So what do you want me to do?
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Dad!
He's got piano lessons.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
-- Burn them.
Got a cause?
You don't know... nobody knows...
Investigator Rimgale.
Inspector.
"Don?"
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Are you all right, honey?
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
He gots to be did.
Ho!
Give me some?
Who are you revolting against?
Please.
Delacroix.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
And I'm the feet.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
I'm sorry I'm late.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
That's a great handle.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
How did you end up here?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
I didn't mean that, in life.
So what's up with you?
He never showed it.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Hello.
You okay?
We both lied to him.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
A gift.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Why'd you do that?
Light?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
No.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
He said that?
Not at all?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
To come back to our roots.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
I fell out of my bed last night.
Oh you do, huh?
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
What is your uncle's name?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Your honor must lower his voice.
I have no luggage.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
No.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
It is my only object.
Agreed.
By name only.
Does this assignment interest you?
Was he cheated?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Bill Styles...
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What about Pike?
You killed him you fucking faggot --
You saved Kendall's life --
Do what?
What business?
Where?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Cadet, what's your name!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
We just want to check your pack --
Right?
Why... why didn't you tell me?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
MAYBE WHAT --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Home, I'm done.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Excuse me?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Dunbar.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
We need to talk --
This isn't the time --
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Pike never confessed.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
How long have you known my father?
How old are you?
So I've heard.
I'll...
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
She was a witch.
You mean, while I'm here.
How what happens?
Where are we headed?
Daffodils?
'Fraid so.
I talked with your father last night.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
You're not.
Mom?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Good. 
You must have a visa or something...
I understand. I'm so sorry
He wants the money from your bank.
Oh Jesus.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
You don't understand anything.
I know you just want to punish me --
What? No you're not..
It's none of your business.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes neither.
So now you hate all women?
I got what I paid for.
No.
Nobody's that unhappy.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
It's not mine.
Yeah, I know.
Oh! Gave me a start.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
When? Now? Oh. No.
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Sure.
She's around. Always is.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
You gonna steal my truck?
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Better'n me?
Let go...
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Let go of my arm...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
What do you want?
No ma'am.
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Want another?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
You need some weed?
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Huh?
What'chu sayin'?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Why she got a chain on her?
Thank you.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
Rae...
Yeah?
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Maybe we should do something?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
Let's go.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Why the hell not?
How'd you get this?
Nick...
Ichiro --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
It's illegal, Nick.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Start it.
I couldn't tell.
Why's that?
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
Don't be an ass.
He drinks.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
I want a gun.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
Let's go while there is still time.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
We have a lot in common.
You could help us.
No.
I want to do it.
What was he after?
Yeah.
Okay, but...
Do you have something against science?
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Prosit.
These aren't just...
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Book the good ones for where?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
It would be my child.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
So?
Do you dream?
Ten years.
May I ask a personal question?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Oh, now, that's a great one!
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Dickhead?
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
What is it?!
How's that?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Thank you.
Name it.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
The big one!
Everybody's divorced.
When do you need her by?
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Sure.
Do I look crazy?
I thought I was here to meet women.
Not that one!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
You wanted to see me!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
There.
Really?  Okay!
I've got to go, now.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Uh-huh.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
1959.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
What?!
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
You don't look thirty-five.
Twenty-five? Around there.
What?  What is it?!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Really?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Oh, no.
Let's eat our cake.
Yes...
In the generator room again?
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
No.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
You came back for these?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
I don't know.
What's that supposed to mean?
Always good advice.
To bed?
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
He left with Sophie.
What?!!
I don't think so.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
To your health, Frank.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
It must be great.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Yes? What is it?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
No.
Yes.
No.
You don't?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
I want you to hurt me.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'll call you.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
I don't want to go.
What are you lookin' at?
Okay Frank.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
What?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Nothing. I'm fine.
No. No thank you.
Well.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Alright.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
What's the plan.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
He got a little jealous.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
You worry about me really?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
It's okay.
I can't dance fast.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Hey, I just...
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What happened?
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Where the fuck are you going?
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Nine bodies.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Can she I.D. them?
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
So what are you thinkin' here?
The fat man.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
What?
Twist of lemon!
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey Murph.
Hello?
We'll keep going, Roc.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
What is it my son?
Has he now?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I guess not.
Father, I'll do you right here.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
This is he?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Yeah, I saw it.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Where's the manager?
Like he meant it.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
May I have a word with you, please?
Which one was that?
He's gone. He stole the car.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
We said 48 hours.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Dignan. Take it easy.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
I don't know.
It's going back down.
Nobody move!
I don't know.
I'll see you there.
What?
Scale the --
You mean like techniques?
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
What do you mean?
Did Dignan take the test?
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
There's a million places to hide around here.
You think he got my license plates?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Sixty days?
Like silk?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Uh-uh.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
The front stairs.
Wait. Did he see us?
What?
No.
OK, Bob.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
That's my responsibility.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Way to go, Bob!
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
Give me the keys, Dignan.
What's his name?
Bob, you're lying!
I'm sorry, Bob.
I know it, man. Hang on.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
He's having a heart attack or something.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Where's Applejack?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
What do you mean grammar?
Well, I think --
Where?
The world needs dreamers, son.
And what are we looking for?
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
That's not what happened to your parents.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
Is this really happening?
So why didn't you kill me then?
Who sent you to Greece?
Pamela Landy?
I'm sorry.
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Sleep. Sleep now.
But we were so careful.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I wanted to kill him.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Yes.
Why is she trying to kill me?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Oh, shit...
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
What?
What kind of problems?
If you say so.
Let's give him half an hour.
Anything?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
But if we have not caught Wallace --
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
You fancy him.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
You'll move
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Where is my son?
Shall I leave, M'lord?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Treason. Against whom?
Thank you for inviting.
Tonight then.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
We can't stop!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
No dances, just tell me.
Um... can dad come this time?
Can't he come out for one day?
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
Ouch.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
And you are...?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Destroy it?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Does he know that?
Goodnight.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Er, good luck, yes.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Uh huh.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
How did you get in?
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No, not yet.
But Richard, no, I, I --
But what about us?
And I said I would never leave you.
Where is Rick?
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
How do you do?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
We'll come again.
Well, this might come in handy.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I slept very well.
I believe you have a message for him?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Even in Berlin.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
His escape.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Yeah, you were saying?
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
You're late.
Sam's piano.
You think of everything, don't you?
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
What's that you're playing?
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Get water!
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Oh?  You've tried?
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Her name's Hannah.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
When's the next Jumbo?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Yes, yes he did.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
To Wilson.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
To life.
What, then?
Only if you can afford it.
These *credentials* are against the law!
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Burma!
So. Not bored yet?
I better go.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
At what altitude?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
In other words, scurvy.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
Do you like to read?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
But you don't look very happy.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
And you have this letter of intent?
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Just the last three weeks.
Keeping the Fix happy.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Ten is standard, sir.
Jake...
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
It can buy you a new and better you.
And what about Big Al?
How much we going after?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
You'll be there?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
I'll worry about Customs.
He's gone.
Lighten up.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Do you have something to prove?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
You tell them the "Tale".
What do you want? An apology?
It's bad luck.
Uh...
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Is it all fugasi?
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Ten percent.
That's it?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You sell it.
To who?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
Maybe another time.
I despise the job.
The Indian rope-trick.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You want me drunk?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
You're my prisoner.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Probably.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
You're my conscience.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I don't like it.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
So how are you doing, dad?
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Near the casino.
In the casino.
I'm in trouble.
I know that. But you can now.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
But if it does.
I don't think we should meet again.
You did?
Have I?
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I put them on together.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
I make it six.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
You can start Monday week.
How do you feel, Jack?
What flickering light?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Oh, God...
It didn't go off.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Energy shielding positive function.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Doolittle...
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Out where?
-- Remark.
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
No wire.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
None of your business.
Move it.
But I'm afraid of--
I ain't mad at you...
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
But why can't we stay here?
What makes you cry?
Mommy, where are you?
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
How do I know you didn't?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Yes on all counts.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
You lost me.
Your basic hodge-podge.
What's in it for you?
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
How long you and me known each other?
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
I'm the victim here.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
I'm a toy to her.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
What about this?
What the hell is that?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
More than anything in the world.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
I-I c-can't...
Beth? I can't believe it.
Ann Arbor?
Yeah.
Namely?
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Cool.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
It was stolen!
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
But we took the keys?
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeah.
Good morning...
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Who is... we?
Where did you come from?
Why do they call you Frank?
Hey...
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Where are we going?
Donnie?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Where is she?
What?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Oh, shit!
I know, Dad.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
How so?
Follow him where?
I met a girl.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
I have the power to build a time machine.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
You-betcha.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Really?
This came for you, sweetie.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
We was robbed.
What?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
You don't know where this is gonna...
That's right.
What?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Gladys! Stop it!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
My dear President...  read it back...
Is that all?
Father...
Did you shoot the rapids?
No, but I shot some ducks.
What other job you got?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Sure.
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
$50?
Excellency, may I present my niece.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Now -- er --
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
They have noble faces.
That I am very little different from him.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
What do you mean?
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
I want my man back.
I want him back!
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Don't we?
How are you feeling today?
I feel much better. Thank you.
What is it, Treves?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Good day...!
Tell me about it, please!
Romance!
y-y-yes--
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
I'll have to find some more.
Yyess.
Righteousness...
You look splendid, John.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Yes, John?
Yes, John.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
A dressing bag.
Are you the proprietor?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Ah! It's my father!
WHAT did you say?
Those things in your hands.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
"The fifth one this week"!
We blew the Horn Resounding.
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Why should you care?
What's wrong with making friends?
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Faster!
It's magic.
But you're the Gods!
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Now stop it!
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
A magic dishcloth.
I AM one, Dad!
I came to find my grandfather.
It can't do you any HARM...
Vanish into thin air?
No, I'm not.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
Sh! Hurry!
Made by YOU, Loki!
So did my father and his father before him.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And something to sharpen them with?
No, Mother.
You rat.
How are you today?
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Okay.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
No. I --
Thanks.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Let's talk about it later.
What?!
Oh, thank God. It's going.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
Such a beautiful view.
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
We did talk about Naomi.
Not yet. Not married.
Probably.
Hi there.
Yeah, like that.
yeah?
Me too. There's this poem --
I think, before.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Yeah.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Oh, um...
Hey, Joel --
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Oddly enough, I do.
I probably got the same thing as you.
How's it going?
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Naomi.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Nothing.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
You made me have an abortion.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Oh, hi.
Yeah?
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
This one's history. Moving on...
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Where are the others?
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
...do you copy?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
From what?
But Justin...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
Will it work?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Please... kill...
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
Justin, finish your sweep.
This is Weir.
Alive?
...how's the client?
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
What does it say?
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
It's complicated...
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
What about my ship?
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
But...
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
I'll do it --
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
You can't do that.
Explosive decompression.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I mean...
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
What the --!
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Hey! That's a prototype!
What do you mean "complete"?
Not this again --
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
What is that thing?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
What are you doing --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Feeling better?
That's good. That's uh... good.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
That's what we're here to find out.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben did this?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
First door on your left!
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Yes, sir.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Poor guy.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Yes.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Who's that?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
My brother's car!
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
He was hot, wasn't he?
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
What do you think it is?
I want romance.
Not coming? What happened?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
What about the notes?
Hi, Mark.
Anything to drink?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Rum and ice, please.
Las Vegas.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
GO?
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Me?
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Spare me.
Careful.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Well, it don't look pretty.
We'll be food, dickheads!
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
Ohhh.
Your parents of relation?
What's in the back?
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
What is this?
Sure.
He's dead.
Seven.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
Bullshit.
'Eh, Chief?
What?!
Yeah, maybe.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
What's wrong?
Let's go!
Oh. I mean, good.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
My clothes?
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Huh.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
GET OUT!
Fired?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Are you... are you hungry?
Oh, Kurt!
Fifteen.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
How'd I look?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
How ya doin', Farmer?
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
What for?
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
Take a walk, pal.
You know something, Harry?
I guess.
To quarter-horses.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Huh?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Anyway... if you need me...
Yeah. I don't know.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
You think I got it?
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
No!
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
What?
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
And if I consent?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
What kind of God is He to will this?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
This feels... incestuous.
I wish to be your husband.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
Victor!
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
Are you having me on?
You can't. Death is God's will!
I've been preoccupied.
A... week?
Is that your diagnosis?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I heard.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You want to leave?
Filmmaker.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Good point.
I'll go check on Brenda.
Claudette...
Give me a hand?
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Ha!
Jack?
Girls can't be cowboys.
One night on the town.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
He's my son.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
In heaven.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
You won't let him touch her?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
What did you call me?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
What do you think Mom would say?
Do what?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Whatsamatter?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
What dya mean?
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Seth, if you were me --
Yes.
What does that mean?
Really?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
That's what you look like.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Thank you, ensign.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Of course, but there's more --
None at this time, sir.
Permission to leave, sir?
Yes?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I can make this wall without --
Come on, Montgomery...
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Which is guy-speak for...
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
"In Washington..."
Well, now I feel so much better.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Who is it?
Last time I didn't.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
Maybe half.  Not even.
Should I be afraid?
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Clear.
O'Neil, Jordan.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
He stole my report! That's my report!
What are you doing?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Can I use some?
What?
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
They didn't make it.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Major, what do you think could have done this?
It's Tatopoulos.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
You gave them the tape?
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Why are you telling this to me?
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Nothing.
Yes. Good was done this .....
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
Alex? Where are you going?
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
What do you mean?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
What's the weather like outside?
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
As good as Hopkins?
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
Tell them? About...
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
You're kidding. When for?
That's it, It's go time.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
I heard it too.
Stop, please! I don't know!
We.. We lie.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Excuse me?
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Okay... On what?
Find them.
WHAT? WH
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Arnold!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Well, George, who were you?
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
I'm so inclined.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
What's your advice, Alexander?
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
I... they look both the same.
These supplies...?
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
What the hell are we doing?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
All people have rights!
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
You get the money?
So you didn't have the key with you.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
Not too bad.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
I don't believe this.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
I'm working on a few things.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Who is this?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Sovereign.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
That's right.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Have we met? I don't recall.
That's what I'm doing.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
Not really.
What does that mean?
Once.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
He died.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
One we're producing.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
You saw that one?
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
You bet.
Whatta you doing out there?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I miss Murray, Harry.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Be quiet and listen.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
What? You sure?
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
A what?
Did you?
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
Dodge to Murphy.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
I don't know what you're talking about?
What the fuck -- ?
The guy. He just came this way.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
So you killed them?
Call the Coastguard?
No, no. You got leak.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Jesus, look at this guy.
No.
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
That's just the way I am!
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
What?
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
Good.
Does Oomie really like this show?
Hey - why do you have this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Look, maybe that's him!
What's he doing now?
As always.
I didn't get it either.
How about this?
It's a surprise.
That guy is totally amazing.
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Do you want to do something tonight?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Do you want anything?
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
That's not even --
Go die, asshole!
What?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Shh!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
So, why did you bring this along?
Yes, that would certainly do...
Wow, this is so cool...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Never...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
So, what happened?
Boo!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
No, of course not.
Uh... sure... come in.
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
What about Joe?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I am.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Why? What did she tell you?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
Then why do you stay?
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
What did I do?
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Good news?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Oh no.
His name is Oscar.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
Good-bye, Peter.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
Or we could do that.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Well, good night, Louis.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Get on with it, counselor!
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Like a goat on garbage.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
And pure --
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Uuuuuuugh!!
Hi, Louis.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Is that your professional opinion?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I think I should spend the night here.
On a purely scientific basis.
I want to help you.
All right.
You must have gotten the last copy.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Is that a game?
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
That's "Peck!"
Yes.  I don't like this.
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
What have you got, Egon?
What is it?
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Gozer.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Sorry, Buddy!
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
What?  What popped in there?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
If I may be so bold...
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
That's difficult to say, general.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Take grain away from the army?
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
My troops don't make policy.
I can see that...
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
You teach them!
Who the hell are you?
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
No.
I think I'd better go home now please.
Where is the car?
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
What is the matter?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
No.
You sure you really want to?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Why aren't you ready?
Because -- I am.
What did she say?
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
My belt.
I just don't think it would work.
Why wouldn't it?
Hello -- who is this?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Thank you.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
One of those outside agitators.
Who screamed?
What did you do to her?
Mrs. Robinson?
Hello.
Give me an hour.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Sir?
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Will you come in, please?
What?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Like what?
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
Aren't you?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
No.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Thank you.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
He didn't see me.
Yes.
That's fine.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes.
Either one will be fine.
This is all terribly wrong.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Are you kidding?
That you're afraid --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Don't you?
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
About five years.
How many times a year.
Is it?
But you don't hate him.
Yes.
There's nothing to tell.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
No.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
I see.
What?
Did I say that?
You don't have to say that.
Thank you.
Very good, sir.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Oh, no.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
No.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
That has nothing to do with it --
What?
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
Why?
Mrs. Robinson?
Turn 'em up.
Why?
He must be very nice.
That.
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
We'll dance.
I'd given you up.
You were very different yesterday.
Will you do me a big favor?
Yes -- oh!
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
And now?
Yes.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I can't.
Till then.
Then you know him?
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
I take five hundred.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
I must have made a mistake.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Anyone asked for me?
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Stay where you are.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Dance then? 
Please -- please!
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Yes, of course, -- money!
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Am I!
Moreover --
You pay me.
I understand you perfectly.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
I must go to England -- at once.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Can you pay some attention to me?
You're sweet.
What?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
We will wait.
Have I kept you waiting?
No. No word.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Roy? He's always crying.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Not much time.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
What is?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
So I heard.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Expecting visitors?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
As though you do what I say.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
You're too young. You should be in school.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Working the what?
The tap. What you do for a living.
I've heard the name.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
And hello to you, too.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
No! Because I --
For Christ's sake, why not?
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
I realize this is a shock.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Ate the gun. Oh.
No question, huh?
Why am I here?
Well, when you put it that way.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Carter.
A dead body?
Do you know who did this?
Another historical inaccuracy.
Checking out your place.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Nothing.
Just get on the bus.
What?  Where is she?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Looks great.  It does.
What are you looking at?
Are you going to leave, too?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
I have to pee.
Mom -- Who is this?
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
You've been watching too much TV.
Who are you?
What makes you think he'll come here again?
What should I do?
Danny?!  Danny!
What now?!
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
Stay away, Sam.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Home.
You know what gets me?
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
So long, Colonel.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
You.
You're an imbecile.
Fifty years?
We got to get another pilot.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
College!
What's good about that?
It makes life spicy.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Will you go to bed?
Can I get dressed first?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
I'm a man.
No.
No.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
What do you do for a living?
What's that all about?
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
No you're not!
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
You've killed women?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
She's fine.  Please--
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
None.
What for?
There's a certain amount of information there.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I'm utterly satisfied.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
New lives begin!
It was a bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
There was so much going on.
How horrible.
So long, you guys.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Oh, Paul--
Still lives with his mother.
I don't really know.
Then who flushed the toilet?
What's his name?
What?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
What does he say to do?
Really?
Everything stays as it is!
My father!
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
How nice.
You and Harold are friends?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
They didn't murder me.
Paul's only twelve years old.
Get out of here.
Is that a fact?
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
You want a tip?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah...
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Do you know where she lives?
Nah.
Where is she?
Where's he?
No.
You're not a private detective either, are you?
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
'Sucking off.'
You used to work at Copper Penny?
No.
He deals in pain.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Granville?
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Where is she?
No.
They're legal now.
Who made it?
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
What's it called?
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
Where'd you hear that name?
What happened?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Hey man.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Where's Ratan?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
Was he with a girl?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Come again.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Because if you are...
Do you dance?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
How about some ginger pie?
But what?
Is he all right?
He's stopped.
You are the wisest person I know.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
What is it, Harold?
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Oh, Harold. 
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
A rough estimate.
And a lot of time.
What about the draft?
No.
Then why did you leave?
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Another man's life in your sights.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Oh sure.
How about to slit his throat?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Yes!
It's coming.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
I... I had a visitor.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
WHY?
Then why are you here?
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
What is it?
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Those things never work. Never.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
Hey. You: think twice --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
You better have that looked at.
That you feel that way about me.
Hello, I'm --
What's the problem?
You did this before, right?
We want the man who did this --
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
No.
That's right. Who are you?
What about Larry --
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Later.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
So where's the harm?
I said no.
No, damn you --
I'm going to throw up.
You're done worse.
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Is this your place ?
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Kirsty?
You'd like the house.
Of course. Every day.
Surprise.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Get the fuck out of here.
Need any help?
You know I do know the way home.
If there's a train.
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Don't let them take me, Steve --
What?
I beg your pardon?
What are you doing?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Oh, so what's the point then?
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Why would they care?
You're not even coming?
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
So?  You even said they're good.
We're getting that anyway.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Nothing.
That's what I said.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Oh, hi.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
What's this?
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Can I do anything?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Just the obvious stuff.
What?
I don't know.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
I'm sure.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Do you want me to be there?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
Nothing.
WHAT?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Fair enough.
How're you holding up?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
That way.  You?
I'll call you.
Yeah?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
This is against the rules.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
I've been to Church Hill.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'd rather hear yours.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Not all of them.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Come here, Brenna.
The inheritance.
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Never take up poker, Detective.
What are you doing man?
I did at that.
Why are you here?
What?
You will live.  Survive.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
How can I stop such a man?
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
What is your position?
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
We must talk.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Of sorts.
It's all we have.
Yes laddie, I have her.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Morning Mr. North
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
Oh, it isn't like that.
Too hot?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Hello, Hildy!
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
What?!!
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Keep away --
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Afraid? I should say not!
What now?
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Hildy!
Where's Bruce?
I'm finished.
Look at me, Hildy --
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Hildy!
Thanks.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
You said it!
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Hey!
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Goodbye, Yonson.
We know what you're up to.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Where is he?
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
I did.  Hold the wire.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
And so do I!
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
That man there!
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
This is going too far, young man.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
It's true.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Crocodiles! Aah!
It was great for me, how was it for you.
A bit too quick.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Except the servicemen.
What did he say?
I don't believe this is happening to me.
You might still have a house.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
What?
Ma, Tiny's in.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Hey, great they're back.
I'd like to see that.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Great story Goober, how much?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Come on, get with the facts.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
How's about you give me those same directions.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
What?
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Goddamn.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
So.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
What? I didn't hear anything.
A couple hours!
What'd we here, Georgie?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Who's your Daddy!
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Gabby, what is it?
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Yeah? What?
You were wonderful!
Oui.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
You what?
I want to be the way I was before.
That's what I'm counting on.
Shut up and tell me.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
As do I.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
You really enjoy my company?
You do?
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Did you see that?
What?
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Who from work?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yes.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Oh boy!
Yes?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
Cash.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Only when I work.
Poker's not your game.
I got drunk.
A thousand.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
How do we stand?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Quit. He's too good.
How much we got?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
How long you been waiting?
What?
What time does the bus leave?
What bus?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Around.
Do you always ask so many questions?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
What do you do on the other days?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Well, he owns things.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
What do you want to tell me?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
A week? A year?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Why?
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Are you all right?
Yes.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
What?
Yes.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Is the hill ours too?
A meteorite, Dad, look!
What did it look like?
I had an awful dream.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
What's wrong, Ellen?
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
What?
When?
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
It's really nice of you to help us.
You have to leave the White House.
You still believe in him.
Did it work?
Can't this thing go any faster?
They don't know this.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Dad, please...
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
But Mr. President...
And our forces?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
That's impossible...
He's trying to impress you.
Sorry for what?
He's my angel.
Oh. Sorry.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
I didn't even see them fire!
Stevie... I can't...
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Can they be killed?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
I said go around!
Mine, too.
He was actually there? You saw him?
...you did it.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Look, can we discuss this later?
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
What?
Dad!
Stop!
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Nice landing.
The penitent man is humble before God.
Get that camel out of the way!
I'll take the camels.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
You think so?
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
What does it mean, Indy?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
What evil?
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
And then they took their children.
Indy! Help me!
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Don't let it curl around you!
Can you move your arm?
It's starting to let go!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
What?
Figures...
Give me your hat...
Where are you,...Al?
Why don't we go home?
Do me a favor, Al.
Somebody's been here.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Are you threatening me?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Loading a gun.
Of course you do!
With a man in my head...
Why not?
Now what?
Why? AL  You know too much.
JOE Or what?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Yeah...Who is?
You need ID in there?
Just scratched my arm, why?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
What was?
Wait.
What?
What happened?
To the hotel. To register.
It worked.
You really like that shirt?
Not that tie with that coat.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Get close to them.
I feel like an idiot.
What Happened?
Is that all?
She's got the most beautiful...s
Osaka?
What do I do?
I told you, I have a feeling...
What are you doing?
haka xuki.
Well...?
Be quiet.
About what?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
Doesn't matter.
What kind of a deal?
Rene?
Impossible.
Who's our little man?
**?!! 
That name's familiar.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
What?
What did you say?
No. No one to speak of.
And you.
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
As if your mind's not all there.
Can I help?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
And how'm I doing?
You seemed interesting.
Why did they leave?
No, he didn't do that.
Who did?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Now what?
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
What is it?
Why are you on to him?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Why'd you invite me here?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Hi, honey.
What's that outside, Daddy?
I heard them.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
How long?
Shit...
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
And what are you implying?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
That computer has everything...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
You're sure you want to do this?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
What do you need at the store?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
They're killing the Wigand interview...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Alright?
So, is everything okay?
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Yeah.
Give me a break!
Yeah... Thank you.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Did work.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
The new place? New.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Good. But Jeff...
No.
What?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Seven...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
You're in a rush.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
What?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Marylin! What have I done?
Is Tong older than Ming?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Hello?
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? When did I say...?
Screw you, asswipe!
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
We're damaged goods.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Good.  Are those foods?
Comfy!
You can't prove anything.
That's blackmail.
Marylin?
I fell in love Miles.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Murder!
Are you alright? You lost weight.
I was devastated. Of course.
So. Now what?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Well what does he want?
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Mr. Rexroth.
Rex, please.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Wrigley!
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
HA!
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What've you got against King Westley?
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well!
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
You talk as if
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
This looks like the best spot.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I don't want it now.
was so scaredthat it scared
What are you thinking about?
No. But I've got a penknife. 
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
Here comes a car!
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Eight o'clock tonight.
In about fifteen minutes.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I'd put you there myself.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
No.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
What's the other name?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Go on, Willie.
I did.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
What do you mean?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
What was so appealing about Houston?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
No, you don't!
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Who?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
Time?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
You have other information?
Where is Banister in all this?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Do you walk home?
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Look, man, I know I owe you --
How'd you know where he was?
And you didn't tell the Police?
Why does it need to be dark?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
Shit.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
With ten thousand? Nine.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Want to hear some music?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
"American President"
What're you, a bag lady?
You talk them into it?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
When did you decide?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
What do you do when he comes home?
Did you do it that night?
The feds. It's evidence.
Do you think they bought it?
It'll be more than that.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
What's he doing?
I know.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
You said that the last time.
Yes. All those things are true.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
There was a guy with Melanie?
I have no idea.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
I thought you were watching him.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Buy ya a beer?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Kinda.
Dreaming.
Hi, Melanie.
Got some o.j.?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
It's true, isn't it?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
A woman.
No, I give it to someone else first.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
That's the idea.
Who?
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Where at?
What for?
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
Lemme have the bag.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
What does that mean?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Where's the rest of it?
That's right.
Fuck you for asking me that.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Who's it for? A relative?
Getting there.
What?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Did the police contact you?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
That's all?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
He ain't here right now.
Well, try, huh.
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Daddy, what was that noise?
It's cold.
Now what?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
You need ... a doctor.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
But the paper ...
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
How long had that been going on?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Who?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
What?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Hell, you think I am?
I don't want to know.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
I didn't want to wake you.
Jezzie, I can't see.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
What do you mean you can see?
Ready?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
What does it say?
Help me! Help me!
I know.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Bullshit!
I love you when you're angry.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
You've lived with me for two years.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Shows how much you knew.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
I no from around here.
How was Palm Springs?
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Count 'em on one hand.
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
That black car?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Everywhere, like a plague.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
I have some ice from the machine.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
We're not leaving Crutch!
Goodbye old friend.
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Nice touch.
I'll need system four converters.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
I am an expert!
My job.
Wait a minute...I need...
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
You?
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
She needs a little time.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
Okay?!!
Now that's just gross.
I'm missing two!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Am I in there?
What?
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
I'm sending you the files.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
More soldiers?
How do you open the damn door?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
My boat's neat, dad!
My cars. And a comic book.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
What do you mean 'We...?'
Have you ever had one do this?
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Don't forget these.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Michael! Come inside!
Now tell me something I don't know.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Got a pen on you?
Why?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
What? What?!
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Twenty years.
Transplants?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Easy! It'll tear right out!
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
I'm not hungry, oddly.
I'm supposed to be running.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Um, hi?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know it's okay.
Oh, hey Vijay.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Oh, God...
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Viscera?
You know... it's parts...
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
No.
What's the matter?
But you're old!
God, you're so young.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Aha! You love him.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
So. What's that thing?
What would be a good time for you?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Carryin' a gun.
What?
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
What if they're dangerous?
Shush, Adele.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Thanks. What are you doing?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
A book on the warehouse murders?
What did he sound like on the phone?
Carrie.
Where's Adele?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
You were plenty hot.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
To what? Virgins?
What do you want?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Who?
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
What are you talking about?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Casper, where is he?
Yeah.
Man we fucked him up.
Sup. Sup.
Hey.
You have?
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Do you care about me?
What?
One.
Miss, would I be prying?
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yep.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
But then I won't need your money.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
I don't know, eight or nine.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
What do you want?
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
You think he's dirty?
Take it easy.  Both of you.
You alright?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
And -- what path is that?
Hello?
Because she's the type.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Just for that no hint today.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
You might not have done it had you known.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
It isn't Kathy.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
How long has she been dead?
How long she been dead?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
The most logical choice.
A building?
Where were you last night?
He knows you're aware of that.
Peter...
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
Mate in five.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
This isn't a game.
I'm sorry.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
Peter...
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
You beat him.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
Thank you, but I can wait.
I lied.
Have they harmed you?
Yes.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
Yes.
My <u>friend</u>.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
Not sleepy, either?
We must try to get horses.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
No.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
You had better manners as a pig.
Food for crows.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
He will come for me.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Kegan!
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
It is no trickery.
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
No?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Why can't I have a bank account?
Huh... 500 meters?
Who'll I aim at?
What?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
...I'm going to kiss you.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Messina.
...Who sent you?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
I'll make it.
What?
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
How long does this... Mania last?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
I know where my heaven is.
Go to sleep Ellen.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Shit!  He jumped!
This story is big huh?
Mammoth.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Why know?
What Mr. Parker?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
How are you feeling?
What do you mean?
What's your shoe size?
What do you think I should get?
...Noooo.
Coffee?
Sarah -- with an H?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Sera...
Me neither.
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
I like it here with you.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Yuri... are you...
That's right.
Are we done for today?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
No. I was in the shower.
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Huh?
Why the hell not?
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
You're hitting on me?
What did you see when you entered the house?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
God, that felt great!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
I'm her sister.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
What?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
What?!
Josh proposed!
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Are you asking me on a date?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Why not?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
You look -- nice.
Elle?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Birdies... pretty...
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Why have you brought me here?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
It's terrible.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Enough!
No... I... I need to rest.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
The princess is dead.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Don't get too far!
Never show mercy!
Where?
But you did... you did!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
My lady mocks me.
Tis not fit for a princess.
You've freed me, Jack...
Lili... I love you!
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
She's dead!
I don't believe you.
Courage, Jack.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Jest with me then.
How so?
And sweet?
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
And video games after!
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
Do you guys feel like painting?
Why?  What do you mean?
Why?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Did you feel anything?
Hey.
Where's your dad?
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
I'm coming in.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
And of course the Beck's, with the...
A violation?
A sink?
That would take weeks.
I'm not.
Maybe that's too long.
How old are you?
Thank you.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
You're here early today.
Is Alyssa here?
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
Why would you be there?
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I can promise you complete privacy.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'm not even listening.
I know the feeling.
What are you now?
I wish you had told me then.
I'm telling you now.
I would have killed him.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
What would you do?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
She needs to be alone, I think.
Lock the door behind you.
Where will you live?
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
It makes me sad.
Which?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I'm married.
Is your back still killing you?
What did he say?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
His father is a man.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I can't go right now.
You never really trusted me.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
No.
Hey.
I didn't go in your room.
This is what he wants.
Dad's home, already?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Is Mae Rose okay?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
She got married last month.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Nothing.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
A loan officer?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
He's dead.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
So?
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Yeah.
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Don't mention it.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
Crop duster.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
I'm not working on a plan.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
'Course I was right. About what?
I know you're not talking to me...
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
How about some steak sauce?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Jenny?
Is this a joke?
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
Urr... uggg... errr...
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
So far, so good. Now what?
This is baloney!
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
What was it called, sir.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Hey...
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
You think I'm a tourist?
You have a dog? What kind?
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
We're going to Jersey?
From? From? From?
Just the face.
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
No.  Just no.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
No.
And now?
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
You could have called me yourself.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Why show me?
You know something.
What're you going to do?
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
I'm afraid.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Don't!
Don't ever let go.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Beloved husband...
Is it inside the city?
All this. All of it.
Hello.
How long have you been living here?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Well? How do you like it?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
You're not contagious are you?
Do you own a video camera?
As best we can.
Hello.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Andy?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
You talk to him?
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
We've met before, haven't we?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Called? When?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
No. No, I don't.
What's goin' on?
Yeah?...
What are you guys doin'?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Last time I saw you.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Cable from Gainsford.
Fossils, huh?
I see.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
And be poisoned out here in the open?
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
If you want me to!
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Where is your mad pilot?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
As far away as I ever want to be.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Father Perrault is dead.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
George, what do you think you're doing?
You can't leave, George.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Oh, George . . .
Yes, the little Russian girl.
You can't take her away from here!
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
My name's Sondra.
Thank you.
I wonder.
Bump?
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
I was just going to.
Why, mother?
...touch that.
I guess I lost:
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
You do?
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Sir, you can't just--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Something seem unusual to you about that?
And what's this ... ?
Looks like a train ticket.
The radio show?
Jesus...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Sure.
So... how'd you hear about this?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Yeah ... ?
Nowhere.
Actually, yeah--
Which way?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Can you see the balloon man?
He'll turn around.
Please --
Who wanted her little girl back?
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
Found?  Where?
It's all I could safely move.
They were performance pieces.
Kill type?
Lara --
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
Seventeen minutes.
We can't grab it...
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
Yes.
You set me up...
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Wally, listen to me...
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
What happened?  Where's the rest?
You're alive?
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Some -- somebody's father?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
You don't seem all that proud.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Why should I trust you?
How do I even know which one has it?
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
What?
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
We can stop him.
Raincheck?
Howard --
Cream and sugar.
Since right after we lost our son.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
He's great, right. Is he great?
Bullshit.
Ricky's not wearing one.
What's wrong, baby?
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Oh my god. What happened?
I'm ready.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Yeah? You sure?
Ho's a good guy --
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
There's no touching.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
When's it going down?
You like the ponies?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
I'll work it off.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
We're with Ruiz.
What are you saying?
Then why do you try to get in?
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Sorry coach.
What are we delivering?
How'd you unlock my phone?
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Who you calling?
Yeah, I guess.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
I mean, that's what I heard --
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
About what?
You fucking nuts?
What the fuck's going on?
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
The what?
Wanna bet?
What about it?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
It's gonna be fine.
So what do we do?
Three and a half hours?
Where do you get this shit?
I want to leave right now.
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
You look good, man.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Excuse me.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Yeah.
I get it.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
I am.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Where can I get a hold of you?
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Elijah who?
What do you do with your time?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
The body is a holy repository.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
What points?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Did you hear what I said?
It will be rough.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what is your question?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Let me do it then.
Can I ask you something?
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I ain't doing bad.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[Where are you coming from?]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[How does it work?]
[Who pays you?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[No!]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Who ordered it?]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
Yes.
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Yeah, right...
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Why not?
Did you like school, Creasy?
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
It hurts.
Where's my mother?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
The gunshot holds no fear.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
What was her name?
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
It pains that they should do this.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
This is the kitchen.
Marty...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
You say something?
I'm just here with another girl.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
That's the one.
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
What?
It's loaded with what?
You gonna get married.
Marty...
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
I heard you, Ma.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
Hospital.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
When?
We could steal one of the choppers.
Ravenous. What about you?
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
A football game?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
What for?
No, no, that one.
For you, Trapper.
I don't feel anything.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
How did you get called that?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
Of course not.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
He's coming to.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
Huh?
Are you all right?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Action?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Yes!
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Who?
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
A deal?
Who, for instance?
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
What's the idea?
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
I ain't seen him for a week.
I used to pitch.
Baseball?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
Hey, Boss.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
I trust him.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Huh? Get what?
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Yes! I was paid! But the
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
That's too bad.
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
I know one way you can do it.
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
Dinner's on you.
Don't make do it, Mike.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Who are you again?
Hi, Roper.
That's right.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
I've rarely shot anyone.
What's the point of this?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You got a girlfriend?
Explain how that works.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
You're crazy.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Have you evacuated anyone?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
You think I didn't need you?
If you did, you never showed it.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
It's okay. We broke up.
You like this place?
It's very nice.
Korda escaped.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
You crazy? With all those people around?
Stay up there, Girl...
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
You let us worry about that.
And a car.
I can't do that.
This is Halden.
There are two million people in there with you.
You were right.
But this is impossible.
No.
Not my problem.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
And what about the reconfiguration?
You sure he's going to come?
Who?
The woman you're stuck on.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
I know.
Not you.  A copy.
We've got him locked!
All systems go!
Let's go after him!!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
But boss, what about their parents?
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
You scare me, Charlie.
What do you mean?
Shane was a friend of yours?
You could have stopped him.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
So what is the problem?
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
I been thinkin'...
You bastards, I said twenty!
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
You boys carryin' pieces?
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He's trying to make it.
Where we headed?
You gotta plan these things.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
You disrespect our tradition.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Best we got.
Who did this?
Switch hands.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
What's the "bad" part?
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
You know--little worms--ambition.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
What dame?
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
"There's more light here," he says--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Again? Good idea.
Tunnel?
Well, let's get going.
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
No--not offhand--
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
All right, why?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
What!
Than what?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
A pet shop?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Mr. President!
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
I have no defense against forged papers and--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
No, Jeff--please--!
Jefferson--
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Convene?
Punch?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Tonight.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
I did--and--and I got right up.
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Have I?
No!
In Terry Canyon?
Second drawer.
Not another bill?
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Sure.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
I'm splendid, too.
Well! You don't say!
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
I know that.
Susan!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Why don't you do it yourself?
Well--me, too!
Do you?
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
How nice.
Father--oh.
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Yes.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Since he was born.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Yes, sir.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
It's wonderful.
That depends on what they see.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
Oh, I don't know.
Really?
He played in the town band, too.
Yeah, I know.
He did?
In a day or so, I think.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Hello, Mary?
No. It's nothing.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
He's not home, I tell you!
Better wire him right away, John.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
How do you do.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What for?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Why should you?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Proceed.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Binge?
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
You try it.
Shall I call the police, sir?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
What are you doing for lunch?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
Althea hasn't told you?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
It was Henry Follett.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Sure.
Martin.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Be specific.
Sore throat?
Yes.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
It's all right.
Either one.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
That's... good?
Of course.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I don't follow you.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Okay...
Hello?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
What?
Will you think about it?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
How are you?
I understand.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
I can tell you anything else.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
But look at me now...
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
Lily.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
I'm here for you, Doc.
When?
I never killed a priest before.
Intestines.
What is he doing here?
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
The sun turning black.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Every damn day.
For what?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
No you're not.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
You called me your girl?
Have you no respect for the dead?
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
That thing gives me the creeps.
You did not!?... We're not!?
That looked rather painful.
I thought you were done?
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Eat your mustard.
Have you considered my offer?
You're nuts.
Just a waitress.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
GET MAD!
But she still might call!
So you're chicken?
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
The who?
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Firepower costs money.
Yes, Obie-wan.
We're superheroes.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Oh hi, Mom.
I always knew that you were special.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
That was too close.
Where am I going?
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
And, what a delightful idea!
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
There are none here.
Where are they?
And where is Joseph?
Bertrand, sire.
No, sire... I was asleep.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
A glass of champagne, please.
I haven't been there for three years.
My God...!  What time is it?
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Only Lisette?
Lisette La Croix.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
May I offer you a drink?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Will you be joining us, soon?
Five minutes.
Yes.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
We have a treaty with Austria.
What I am talking about is moderation.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Come in.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
It's cool, but where's the water?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
No I'm not.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Man, this a cool house.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Who is that?
It works.
Hello, remember me?
Huh?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
I did.  Is that door locked?
Next time, page me first.
Delivery!
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
What's the matter?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
He's inside the house?
What?!  What that mean?
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Ah damn.  Damn.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Just do it.
'Take your car?'
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Huh?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
No.
Who did?
Could I see some identification, sir?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
You know what I'm gonna do.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Ready?
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Will you promise me that?
I promise.
It's a twenty.
Oh, man...
Please. Something is going to happen...
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Cover your mouth.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Meet Irene.
Yeah.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I've got something for you.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Foreigners! Fuck!
That's enough.
Any trouble?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Here they come.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
She went.
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
He lied!
There's something else.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Pearl! You ain't --
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Up river.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
It -- she --
I don't know nothin'!
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Now it's your turn.
I'm hungry.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Do you want more children, Willa?
I been bad!
When did I ever?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
What the hell's going on!?
Uh-oh...
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
What?
Who? Who did that?
Did you sleep?
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Go even crazier?
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Well, here are fifty francs.
What is it, Ninotchka?
You want this?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
That must be the one!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Monsieur.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
The former Duchess!
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Good evening, Your Highness.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
What did she say about me?
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
Comrade Kopalski...
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
What for... why?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
In other words you don't know.
How long does it take a man to land?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Suppress it.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Yes, it is.
Please don't misunderstand me...
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
You repeat yourself.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
I always eat here.
What are you after?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
I don't think so.
Yes.
No... go on.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Comrades! Comrades!
No speech.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
But I can throw it out of the window.
They belong to the people.
Yes, sweetheart. 
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Yes, Swana, you did.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Cigarette?
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Uh huh ...
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I agree it's ridiculous but --
I'll bet he would.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
No, sir, you did not.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
So?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Sir?
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
How is this national security?
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
What'd he say?
My friends call me "Mister President."
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
How the fuck did you know?
Why, you got a customer?
The White House.
You're fucking me.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
I beg your pardon --
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Where you from?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
What's in there?
Of them.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Is that the truth?
You don't have to go.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
I've missed you.
Are you okay?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
To what?
Some say you are, Rocky.
How'd you know I was here.
You heard it?
In Angola. Yeah.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
No I ain't.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
I always am.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
What's in the satchel?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
No. I found it.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Yes I do.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
I can't say.
What's this about?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
...I know where you are.
...Me?
Will there be anything else?
You live in that house behind the store?
Call it?
For what?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
One room, one night.
Good. I need everything else.
You want to change rooms?
Another additional.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Cast iron?
No I don't have it.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
You do, I reckon.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
How is she?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
It wasn't a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Did you send anyone out there?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
No, I was just... How you doing?
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Umm... yes. Back home.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Do what?
I gotta go.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
Lyla's very nice.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
George...
Sure you don't want any salad?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
What?
I came for love...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Dr. David Ravell.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Worse.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
The one you were telling me about?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
If we're for real?
Fine. You got five...
Of what?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
I... I don't know...
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hell of a way to die.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
I'm not telling.
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
You lie, motherfucker...
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Gopher, Everett?
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
In any state.
Latch right on to that tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Pullin' ah pants down...
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
You -
Uh-huh.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
A million dollars.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Yes, sir.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
You... in the Navy?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
When did this happen?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Yes, sir!!
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Great.
Yeah... Mmmm...
Everything was different.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
You're better than candy.
I'll get it if you want.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
No. Is that what you want?
Could you believe those girls!
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
What?
God.
Yes.
This is ridiculous...
The hell does she want?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
They're gonna die in there!
She's never coming out.
I mean it!
'Bout four o'clock.
Could the child please stop that?
Oh, I've seen these...
Open the door.
Can't hear a thing.
I heard you.
Say fuck.
Fuck.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Blue is phones?
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He won't even know who it was.
Stop it.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
You want me to put a man on it?
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
I don't think that will be any problem...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
You mean...
That's right brother... listen and learn.
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
We appreciate your help with this.
I don't know.
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Motherfuckers...
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Ain't no one seen him.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
Yes, sir.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
You're in no condition to ride.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
No, I don't.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Don't touch him.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Put those away.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Bite?
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
You believe in it.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
Allman Brothers.
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Doesn't look like they last long.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
No, I really think I do.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
The curse drove you to gather this?
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
What?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
Miss Swann.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Because you're a pirate.
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Are you certain this is the right way?
No, it's not.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
... No.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
No.  She hasn't.
But --
Have you found Dr. Bright?
You can't mean that.
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Oh no?  Smell this.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Then you still love me?
Consideration?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
The replicators?
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Susan!
Daniel...
It already is.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Got it.
Is something wrong?
Susan!
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
We've got to get the nanobot.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
Oh yes you are!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Oh, Mother!
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You're acting like a child.
What is this person doing here?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
You're the Tribune man?
Huh?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah - go on.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
What play?
My play.
Thank you, sir.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
That's a lovely dress.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
The boss is getting hoarse.
and that
Thanks, thanks.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Staring at us?
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Stop calling me Mother!
Yes - the worm!
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Yes sir.
Yes.
What do you mean?
You sure you want to know this?
What?
It's okay. It's alright.
Have you got any make up?
Looks just like it did.
Like a drum.
How was your day?
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
But it could happen.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Oh sure it is.
Well, I never had to do it before.
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
I don't know.
Noooooo!
We're supposed to be in school.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
Jen, listen ...
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Not directly anyhow ...
The pages filled in?
... Yeah.
So what is it?
Yeah ...
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
No. I baked them for you.
Hi.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah.
You want some berries?
What's going on?
What do we do?
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Excuse me?
I want a word with you ...
What do you mean?
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Yeah ...
You know what I really like?
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
It's beautiful.
TV repair?
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
...yes I'm still on hold...
This is "Fly With Us?"
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
So it's ok if I bring her.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Nothing.
...just talking to you....
You have a girlfriend?
...yeah....well you have me now.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
I'm going to work.
You're going to work now?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I don't have a girlfriend --
They're not open yet?
Yeah.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
Yeah, no, I see --
So that was your pudding?
Is everything ok?
I don't know.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
That was good.
Yeah?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
...what...?
Yeah.
Where do you have to go?
For work.....
I think maybe over a hundred.
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
Ok.
No.
I know.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
What do you mean?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your Social Security number.
What's that for?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
Sorry about that.
Hi Walter.
That was weird. I meant good.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Hey, good morning, Barry.
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
WHICH?
Ok.
Yeah.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Are you serious with this?
You can't just stay in your house.
Your expenses are your own.
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
That's it.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
Madeleine --
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
In part, yes.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
Enough to discern its tenor.
And --?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
They can't be serious.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
A man after my own heart...
What on earth would that require?
I saw the longing in your eye --
AND DID YOU?
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
Quite.
I'll be waiting.
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
And I in yours.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
I wanted it
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Can I talk to Hearst?
Not for me.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
The great Spanish bullfighter
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
It's 350 pages long.
It's good, huh?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
Jesus Christ --
I want you back
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
You're going to destroy it
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Orson, you wanna take five?
We done?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
Believe what you want.
You heard me, I said hit me.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Say what you're gonna say.
Whatcha doin'?
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
I did keep an eye...
What do you mean, "you"?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Does that mean...
You sound bitter.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
I just wanted to say hello.
You don't talk very much.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Should I hit it?
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
I was just...
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
That he's got a pretty face.
Positive.
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
What's the matter with you?
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
What?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
I said, let's go.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.
You think I made all this up?
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
I can't do that.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Did you ever own a saw?
Jefferies.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Who are you?
Can you get me that ring back?
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
Lisa Fremont.
Stella!
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
And your stomach?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Yes.
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Of course not.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
That's what the witnesses told him.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
The same.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
What you say your name was?
Jim Stark.
Blood.
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No!
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
See?  It stopped.
Frank!
John Crawford?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Boy!
What?
It's me!
I'm here.  Shut up.
Isn't it crazy?
We'll take it!
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
No.  At dawn.
You sure?
No.
What?
Mom--I'm not--
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
They never do.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Plato!
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I'm never going back.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
How many rooms do you think there are?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
You disappointed?
It is for me too.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
What's he like?
What?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
No.  Why?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Gabriel, let him go --
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
Searching for a money man...
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
You forget where I work?
...the truck driver...
You're in on this.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
That guy knows you?
You saved me.
They'll have guns.
What?
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
You what...
Yes!
What college.
Christmas... Eve...
What?
I did.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
That motherfucker --
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
It's a roach, guy --
Hot chocolate.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Just a roach, Zook.
She set them up. All of them.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Switch seats with me.
Yes.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Where was she from, Compton?
Daddy, did ya see that?
Bullshit.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
What about?
The Brewers.
Didja use the commode story?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Mr. Blue's dead?
Give me this fucking thing.
What do you care?
What the fuck are you talking about?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Don't ask me that.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
I know.
Your name's Freddy something.
Freddy Newendyke.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Want a smoke?
No real people?
No shit?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Maybe he did.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
You can stay here if you like.
Yeah.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
We can't stay here!
He knows his alphabet.
Thanks for taking over.
Why?
Which ranch?
What was he in jail for?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Is that the only reason you came back?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
It isn't that --
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
There aren't any women here.
And you're all alone.
Maybe I better start working on him.
We might as well start a fire.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Would you like to learn them?
Maybe I could start you out.
Would they be good to eat?
Well, Steve?
Me, too. 101?
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
It's coming!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
No, stay.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Hi Buddy.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Feel that?
There's something I really want to share with you.
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, right.
I'm Cindy.
Father!
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Yo! That jacket is tight.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
I take it you're not mad at me.
Right. What about condoms?
My God! Is she dead?
What is it, Dwight?
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Oh, boy! 
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
He goes to college with me!
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
That's nice.
Chip, your ride is here.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Oooohhhh.
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Who wants fruit salad?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
...Browsing.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
You know who I am, August?
Let's get out of here.
When I wanted to.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I haven't got that much in cash.
I can't understand it at all.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Why?
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
She'll have to know some time.
Why wait?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I understand.
Jason, my pet 
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I've lost my knack.
Uhhuh.
Wait - there is that other favor.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Perhaps.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
But you would like to know where she is?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Ann?
Well...
Nine years?
I feel like they do.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
My therapist said that --
You had sex with you therapist?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
You know?
She said it on her tape.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Did you have sex before you were married?
I guess not.
So you do fantasize?
Have you fantasized about me?
Yes.
Can't.
Her name was Elizabeth.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
That's very flattering.
Why not?
Yes.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
You're not answering me.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
I take it you've never masturbated?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Why?
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with that?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
But why did you want to?
He wouldn't do that.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
I just want to know why you're here.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Is that what he tells you?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Afraid of getting caught?
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
John Millaney.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Millaney?
Yeah.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Yes.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
What happened?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
About Brad's family?
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
McKinley?...McKinley?
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
I'd forgotten.
Absolutely correct.
Could I do that later?
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Why?
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
Me?
Fast!
Our speciality.
This could be worse than the old series.
And none of them worked?
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
She walks in beauty...
Bye.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
My condolences.
Is it chicken?
Oh yeah.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
I can't help the traffic.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
That's your problem, Miles.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
We should have driven.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
And she likes Pinot.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Get the trunk.
Well, she is cute.
She's been leaving messages here too.
What?
Understanding of what?
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Fucker hit into us.
Slaughterhouse.
It's private.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
What's it look like to you?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
What?
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Want me to drive?
What the fuck!
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
I finished it.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
What's the title?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
What about me?
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Well, nice to see you now.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Hello?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
So what's happening with your book?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
That was fun last night.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Hi sweetie.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
Five. The five longest.
Explain, act crazy?
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Morgan, be careful.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Have they said anything about our area?
Yes.
Did someone save me?
She's not in an ambulance Father.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
That's why they got you in jail?
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
How's Mr. Parker doing?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
My name is Emmett.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Offend anybody lately?
Where's the pinto going?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
You haven't got any money.
Where is Rae?
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
All I did was kiss the girl.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Hello, Rae.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Why him?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
It is that.
So we understand each other?
I thought we talked about that.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
What's she got to do with it?
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
-- What's wrong with that?
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
There isn't one.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
You really think so?
She doesn't want pity.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Really?
Do what?
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Impossible.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Yes, call me Simone.
You're with me to be close to her?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
What's that?
You do?
"Straw God" changed my life.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Hi, Dad.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
She thinks you're with Simone.
I love you, Lainey.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Me and Simone.  What I did.
I'm keeping it in trust.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
I don't understand.
Taller, Viktor.
Would you like me to read?
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Thank you.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Maybe he can.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
What'd you write?
Dr. Crowe.
Yes.
I told you what I want.
I have to.
Are you wigging out?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
Stuttering--
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Looks like the alternator.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
I could. You sucked.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Should we be doing this, dude?
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
How does it feel, Keith?
Yeah?
What about Jeremiah?
What's wrong?
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Suzie... No.
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Sorry.
Who's the lucky fella?
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Why're you driving so fast?
Why? You have a bowling date?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
I give up.
How do you know?
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What can I say?
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
I hate to say I told you so.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
I'm all ears.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
I think you're just yellow.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Yes, ma'am.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
Is your security team armed?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
How bad?
Who?
Mmm-hmm.
I said I got his machine.
I could have it sent out...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
I can't discuss --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...Does he know?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
Yeah... Sid?
So how we lookin'?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Where's his body?
You killed her!
She'll come back.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Why, who did you see?
Who was it?
I wish you'd told me.
Just get him to stop.
I need to see Snow.
We're taking a flight?
Not a very happy poem.
You're better when you take them.
Is it a planet?
What are you talking about?
But we fought.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
You said he was dead.
Rheya --
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
I wish you wouldn't.
Am I really her?
What are you taking?
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
He said he'd kill me.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Yeah.  It was.
I can't open it.
Stop, will you?!
Where?
They guys treatin' you all right?
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
You still going away?
Say goodbye, Mike.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Keep what handy?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
My ass if falling.
Get in bed.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Why?
She bought it.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Lay back, Mack.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
So, what are you doing tonight?
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
You stop him?
Cause if you get in a bind--
Flash, drop it--
See?
Lizzy!
Can't focus...
Mr. Jameson--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Even if they're not clever.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
You'd feel what?
Peter?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
It's Friday night...
It's fine.  Tell me what--
I will finish what I've begun
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
No
Come on!
Ready?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
What are the chances busting out of here?
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You want Betty Grable!
Me? What if she don't want me?
You're teasing me again!
That's what I wanna hear.
Grable, not Gable!
Do Grable.
You're crying, Animal.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Anything else?
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Says who?
Lay off, Sefton.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
What are we going to do with him?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
The what?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Are any of them inhabited?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, this isn't the time.
This is the Nexus?
Left behind?
Where is he now?
These are my children...my children.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
The thought had crossed my mind.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Why don't we beam it up?
David!... What went wrong?
... Fascinating.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Sir...?
How many more?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
Yes, yes, Spock...
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!

Genesis, I want it.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
... He spoke of your friendship.
Yes... But -- how...?
What about Spock?
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
I still don't under --
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
David --
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
You're crazy -- !
But the child --
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I don't mean to intrude.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
The Admiral's son.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Tactical!
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Admiral --
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Spock...!
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Prepare for warp speed.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Certainly...
Yeah.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
You're joking...!
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
... I don't think he understands...
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
You sure you won't change your mind?
You mean man...
How soon?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Thanks.
Memory problems, too.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
... Who are you?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
So. There we are.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
It's true... what you said...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
What is our target in time?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I see.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
I am well, Admiral.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Why?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
Will it?
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Anij!
The artificial lifeform was right?
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Is it safe to move her?
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
How many?
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
A planet in Federation space...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
May I talk to you alone?
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Ask them.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
Good hunting. Hayes out.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
I do not know what you are referring to.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Isn't it better like this...?
Can you configure it?
I have helm control.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
What's still there?
Their com system must still be down.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Active.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Invasion.
Cochrane?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
What makes you say that?
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
That's impossible.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Track their weapons fire.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Good luck, sir.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Are you alright?
Mr. President.
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
No!
Thanks...
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Are we playing multiple choice?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
I was nervous -
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Well, I -
Just the size of my head -
They're preparing to fire.
Klingon blood.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, Captain.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Stand down your weapons.
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Sorry -
Who is "US?"
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Sulu!
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
A lie?
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
What exactly does that mean?
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Because you are dangerous.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Remember him?
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And this makes you "sad"?
Yes, sir.
How long until we reach the fleet?
Yes.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
No.
If you wouldn't mind.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
How long until he can fire?


Just lucky, Admiral.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
And you're not as we imagined you.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
I have no reason to.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
Were we always explorers?
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
We are.
Please.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
He's a very unusual android.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
What?!
Praetor.
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Do you have children?
What was your last stop?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
That's the chance we have to take.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Please...
No gas.
Shit.
It was yellow.
Yes.
Three nights... two days.
What is hitchhike?
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Yes?
Goodbye.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Yes.
Put that back.
I will go. But not you.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You are cold.
But...
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
How long will it take you to get home?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I love you.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
You married, Major?
Yes.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Who did it?
What's going on?
No.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
Let's work it.
Top ten.
Okay... what about Strickland?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Where's Faith?
Naawww.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Who was just here?
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Define illegal.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
No it doesn't.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I've got a good idea, yeah.
It was a tough call.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
Mace... you're a girl.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Are we under arrest?
Testa?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
This isn't in our database?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
What does the Manager say?
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Jesus.
Look, mister...
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
What about his killer?
You have the photo from the diner?
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
How long ago?
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
I didn't use Low's name.
I understand.
Miss me, Dave?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
He thinks he looks young.
What's this country coming to?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Don't be too harsh.
You were right. He found me.
Kulok.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Yes, sir.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
It was the mall.
If I owe, I will go.
[What does the file say?]
I believe it's in my file, sir.
I don't...
But why attack an Agent?
I don't think you understand.
Are you calling Her?
Don't do it, Mike.
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
You too?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
...and even then...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
On the table.
No...
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Why not?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Yeah, hold on.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
How's it going? It's been a while...
So I don't call either way.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Unless she comes back first.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
An eight.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Pause it. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
I'm not going to Vegas.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
That's where we make our scene.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
What an asshole.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
...gotta...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No, baby. You're money.
I just need some time...
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Was I money?
How long do I wait to call?
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Is she looking now?
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...we're not...
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...Okay, two...
Good.  He never doubted you.
What do you wish me to do?
I'm not hungry yet.
You take care of your family?
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
You wanted me to be your son.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Barzini will move against you first.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Corleone.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
I know about what you mean!
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
One of Tattaglia's people?
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
How do you do.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
He'll be OK.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
When will I see you again?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Tell me!
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Do you wish to be baptized?
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
Yeah.
Is that good?
What? What?
Shut up.
What? What's this?
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
No!
What does he say?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Marge-maintenance.
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Yes it is.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he really not here?
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
Dickie did it.
Where does Dickie live?
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
As in the...?
Let's go.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
What rumour?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
He's already angry, I don't think --
It's okay.
Hello. What are you up to?
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
I have!
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
You want to canvass?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
What?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Well... mostly...
What about the record?
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
What's your name?
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Do you understand why I came here?
Can I see you again?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Where?
Pittsburgh.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
There must be something...
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
Yes.
You want to work uptown nights?
How's your driving record?
Twenty-six.
Military record?
You moonlightin?
Your name Sport?
Get it.
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Like do anything, you know.
Maybe.  Not really.
Spit it out.
Well yes I suppose ...
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Hi.
What about you, Delly?
Well...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Nine hundred...
Now, did you remember that, or...
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Mother o'god...
And... what's my name again?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
... what?
Did I what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
That's where you live.
Evening, Luke.
What's his rent?
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Cigarette?
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Well, that's not what they think.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
The customers?  I don't know...
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Ancestors?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Yes?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I did.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
Lois!
No, it's Lois!
Yep.
Where does he live?
Yes?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
I see. How do I get down there?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Daniels.
Thank you.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
What happened?
Oh. I see.
I know, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
They won't be.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Where's Mitch?
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Lovebirds.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
When?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
What's that?
Yes.
We... we went to school together. College.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
What do you do?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
What?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It smelled of the fire.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
The bay doesn't.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
What were the crows after at the school?
Birds?
Not if they're starting a war.
I haven't finished my drink.
But can't you give me any idea?
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
What's that you say?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
Crony indeed!
I was hoping you'd find out.
Fuck! What do you want?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
No...
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
It's ok, it's ok...
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Are you ok?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
I think I dropped an earring.
About you.
Sweetheart...
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
That can easily be arranged.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
About five months -- your months.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Is it worth anything?
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
I don't like horror comics.
Yeah.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Honda 250, huh?
We were gonna grab some food.
You can't kill me, Star.
I will, David!
Or a vampire.
What?
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
No.  Just you.
For what.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
But, Mom...
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Not impressed, are you?
Are you following me?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
I was here first.
Michael?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Let go of me...
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
It's shorted out or something!
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
What we going to do?!
But...
What are you doing?
We should have jumped his ass.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
A couple of hours.
When was the last time you used it?
How far's that?
Put that down!
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
What's...
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
What about Childs?
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
What's happened?!
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
What happened?
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Yes.  Just about here.
What are you?
Excuse me?
It frightens you.
Yes.
Vox...
As slaves.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
So you take their best...
That was a foolish thing to do.
I'm tired of running.
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Dance with me...
What?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Dance with me...
I need... to talk to you.
No... let's walk through the city.
Alex...?!
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
What?
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I live with it every minute of every day.
I can't leave when I'm so close.
That's absurd --
This... was my home.
Did you hear me, lad?
You're not from beyond the valley.
That machine --
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Or mud carriers.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
You know this?
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Why?
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
We don't know.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
Sir, if I may --
How did you get hurt?
Kalen...
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
No, it hasn't.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
What're those?
No, he didn't.
You gotta stop thinking like that.
How you doin'?
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Why not?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
You want a drink?
You like it?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
That sounds nice.
What did ya do?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
I always knew that.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Can't it go to any office?
Call me back.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Peaches.
Hey, peaches.
Front.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Exactly.
Get the car.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
I'm cash poor.
Will I be?
It's probably not a good idea.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
He's got a lot to be proud of.
She thinks he's a pig.
What happened to your hair?
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
I want you to call Darryl.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Thelma!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
You awake?
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
What?
Shit!
What in the hell is that up there?
Yeah... sure did.
No, I just meant...
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Mary again.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I don't know about this, Dom.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
What?
Well? What are you waiting for?
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
'That right?
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
By the way, what's your name?
What's that?
I beg your pardon?
-- He's in a cage?!
All you want is a phone number?
I don't buy it.
No.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Huh?
Oh my.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You know, I really should take your card.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
I'd go with the seven.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
No I'm not.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Pat's an architect, too.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Hi, Ted.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
He's dead.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Trying to be.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Get out.
Go!
What what are you doing here?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
No! I was pissing!
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
Jesus...
Zorin will eat him alive!
Smoke.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
I was eating that.
Let's get out of here.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Bob?
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
A murder. On the reservation.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Who are you?
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
You crashed my file?
What'd she say?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
You've got no jurisdiction.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
He said he doesn't know.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Crow Horse, listen --
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Where was this?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
What do you mean?
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
You ever try solitary confinement?
I could be, too.
How so?
I thought he'd never leave.
I beg your pardon.
Where did you see that?
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
How about what?
I'm different.
No!
You ever think about killing another human being?
Come on.
Where?
You want to go ballistic?
It does.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
Well?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Yes, Sergeant?
This is crazy!
Were upside down!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
I know!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You go. I'm staying with it.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Well what?
What do I want?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
What are you doing?
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I was a victim of circumstance.
Mav's a great flyer but....
No, we...got our butts kicked.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Nope.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
Bad?
You didn't help.
Sir?
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
I never heard that.
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Stop fighting and get out.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Sleazy...and demure.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Pull them out.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
What are you, my father?
Harry, what the hell is this?
Look at this shit.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Is that better?
Mmmm.....
Just think about it.
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
The hell you're not.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
I guess he didn't.
I don't remember you.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
You guys all set?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Burt, can you hear me now?
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Well, sure.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Son of a bitch!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Well, what's wrong with it?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I brought it... to the coroner.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
No. No...
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
-- Yeah?
-- What?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
Afraid of what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
It was self-defense.
'lo, Cecil.
Oh come on, Cecil.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
-- Every word.
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
Blonde.
Tell me some other things about her.
I'm nearly out.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Did she have someone with her?
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
Phillip?
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
How come Jack let's you work here?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Faulty wiring.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
You got it.
Bob.
No... No...
I'm not.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
You'd think so.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Can I take the car?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
What were you doing in my room?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Good night, Mom.
No.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
What's wrong?
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
I'm fine.
What did he find?
Four cases in three years...
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
You would not...?
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
Orthopedics?
How is that?
I'm on the staff of...
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
No further questions.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Thank you. When Debby...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
I'm sorry...?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Hi.
You live in the neighborhood?
I used to be a nurse.
A single hour.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Who told you that?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Continental Casualty...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who are you protecting, then?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Yes. Yes, I have.
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Yeah.
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Oh shit, what's today?
Yeah? How's our new witness?
Yeah. I'm awake.
Uh... the admitting nurse...
She told me.
...of the procedures...
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
It's gone now.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
D.O. to number three..come in.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Just be careful, okay?
Heather?
You going away?
Time for sleep.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Who?
In my bed.
Your bed?
Right 'cross the freeway.
What...what is that?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Holy...
What's that?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Can I get you something to drink?
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
What are they doing?
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Make us proud.
Yeah.
You're not a moron.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
Passport?
How ya doing?
Forget it.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
How do you know?  They might.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
Shouldn't we turn away?
But you invited is aboard.
I can take care of myself.
You're officer of the watch, George.
What's that?
And being sixteen.
That's not a satisfactory answer.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
We've got a problem.
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Suicidal...
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Sorry to hear it.
No.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
She really say she was pregnant?
Have now.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Gas?
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
So, it's back to the islands.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
What happened on the charges?
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
What brand'd she smoke?
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
And you never told nobody about it?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
That don't seem fair.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
They sure do stink.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
You certain?
You ready for this?
Uh huh.
More'n likely.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
You knew my daddy?
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
There's worse places, honey.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
It's okay by me, peanut.
You been drinkin', huh?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
You talk to 'im some?...
How can you say that, Sailor?
I'll bet.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
That's not why I called.
Santos... It isn't.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Through the forehead?
Yes.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Santos... I can't...
Put your shoulders back.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
No.
So?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
You really are one dumb asshole.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
So modest.
Is he awake?
Want some help with that?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
In a sense.
Came to my senses.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
No...
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
You did.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Who's got a gun?
'Fraid so.
Hello?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Goodbye, Grady.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
They're glass. The buttons.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
I had to. Didn't I?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
That's a big book you're writing.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Blocked.
Hm.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Colon cancer.
Carvel.
What kind of dancer?
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Jealous? Of me?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Me? Sure. Why?
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Hey.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Pow.
Really? That was fast.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
James Leer.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
And what did you say?
The more the merrier.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Listen, Antonia --
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Who's this ?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
As a heart attack.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
You doing okay?
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
What are you doing?
It wasn't like that.
The birthday party.
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
I don't like starlings.
You should hear the bird.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
No.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
Why's that?
They sound like finches.
What's her name?
But will he... ?
No.
No way.
Reflect.
It's very good, indeed.
You couldn't say.
I said I was sorry.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
In my bed too.
What the hell are you doing there?
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
It was a small house.
I get that impression.
How about in the morning.
Hey, I'm not --
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
You mean the time you're locked away?
You really believe that?
Being here, with me.
Just think about it.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
How you guys doing?
Okay so far.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
What about O-2?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
Well, that's that.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
That's Perry.
Why bring it here?
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
He's convulsing!
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
You better not say you missed that.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Four or five days.
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
How should I be ... arrogant?
Find anything?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Nothing... nothing at all!
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
It takes even less.
Then why do you say them?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
I love you.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
No. The owners are in Australia.
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
He loves you the way you are.
Who tells you these things?
For what?
That wasn't me.
Yes.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, yes!
Did it hurt?
I got sicker.
Where did the baby come from?
From their heads...
Where'd it come from before that?
Agnes...
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Why not?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I don't know.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Because I don't want one.
Not my fault.
Agnes...
I'm always bad.
She's dead isn't she?
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
No I'm not.
Who am I?
Did you know what was going to come out?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
I don't know which one 
Is someone in the room with you?
Frightened.
She said Michael.
Why?
Him.
She'd seen him too.
Stay away from me...
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
No!
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
No.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
You were a smoker?
Obviously there was.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
I've already told you what I thought.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
All right, what do you need.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
What sheets?
When was that?
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Mary Magdelen?
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Begin what?
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Is it because she's a nun?
Yes.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Before or after you killed the child?
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Lay them down.
Eight and two thirds.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
They'll be here.
I see you go to the night court.
Me? Why?
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Of course I can.
Ta.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Did you look in here?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Ringo!
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Should I say it?
Well, what happened?
Something like that.
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Yes.
Parading?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Clean though, isn't he?
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
What's he know?
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
No.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Now, look here, Norm ...
What?
You are.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Look after him.
Down the ... er ...
What?
What is he?
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Locked.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Can we come up?
A transmission?
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Yes?  What is it?
You like this shit?
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Right. 
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
It's over, Hunter.
What do you mean?
Can you do anything for him?
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
What do you mean, no?
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Oh God, oh God no.
What is it?
It's stopped?
That sounds a little fanciful...
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Let's hear it.
This ship is full of cat hair.
I understand why you did that.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Engaged.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Yes!
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Now what?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Picking up velocity.
What?
What's wrong?
Wait.  Lost it.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Compensate!
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Four.
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
How do you know my name?
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Hungry?
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
We're?
Addison...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
What do you take me for?
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
Then say so.
Yes, Addison.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
We never met. That's why.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Macbeth.
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
Bill...
Knit me a muffler.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
I'll check with Eve...
- guilty.
Nothing, really...
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
No heart to burn.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Groom.
You know what I'm going to be?
Just wondered what?
Ah...
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
Is that what you want me to be?
So am I.
I'm for it.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
You need new girdles.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Birdie-
Night an' day.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
Don't be dense. The party.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Let's not get over-dramatic.
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
I've got it.
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Ain't it the truth?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
They're your fans, your audience-
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
Do you want it on?
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Well...
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
I remember.
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
Lloyd, be careful...
That was a pity...
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
I'm glad Bill's back.
How about calling it a night?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
How's the new one coming?
She's your understudy.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I never said it was!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
I don't think I could be.
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--it was fine the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
July of '71.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--has he got an ax?--
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--jeeeeeeesus--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Night.
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Hey... very tense.
Give me your checkbook then.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
Same kind of crap--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
So?
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Haldeman too?
No.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
What'd you get on W.House?
Howard--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
--no--
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
Sure.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Of course, Finch.  What?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Come on!  I won't tell.
I'm glad you think so.
What?!
You talked to Stifler?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
I think I've had one.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
You can send me the address too.
That's stupid.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I told you.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Don't you want me to?
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
Shame on you!
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Hey...
You sure you're comfortable?
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
NOVA!!
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Here, babe.
Really?
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
What?
Are you okay?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
I know where he'll go.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Oh God. Shit...
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Nothing's happening!
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Why would he pick this one?
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
What've you got?
Merde.
Saint Severin...
I was showing Sonya something . . .
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
You said you wouldn't laugh!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Dmitri didn't want the money?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
See? The Princess is under there ...
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Come on.
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Well, why not?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
How can you possibly oversleep?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Stop it, Alvy!
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Well, no... not just, not only.
Hi. Hi, hi.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
I'll see yuh.
Okay.
M'hm...
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
No.
Yeah?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
And blind people, crippled...
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Do I love you?
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
I have a tiny apartment.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
I'm home!
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
What's- It's me, open up.
Oooh.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Is he in the bathroom?
Okay, let me have this.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Yeah, but it's real close.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Christ!
God.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You look very pretty.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Commentary.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Where are you going?
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
Yeah.
Probably on their first date, right?
Oh.
Whatta you mean?
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Well, sit down.
You wanna lie down?
How about a ginger ale?
M'hm.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
You fired the cleaning woman?
All right-so we can afford it.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Yeah.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
There were many men interested in you?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
And you've only just met.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
October-ish.
What what's about?
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Don't you miss it?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Would you leave us alone right now?
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
But she's alright.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Oh.  You're them.
Cal, my wife Judy.
There's a test, you know.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Did he promise?
You're out of your mind.
Don't get it.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
What?
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Truce?
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Don't be so sure.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
I don't look my age, Joe.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Happy anniversary.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Ah.
The infamous dog?
You got your DP?
I meant Sally.
Something soft.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
What?
Easy tiger.
Lemon or raspberry?
Yes.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
What?
Do you need anything else?
That was my clue.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Are you lovesick?
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Why not?
Nevermind.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
And the food sucks, I know.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
I'm Princess Bala.
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Yes?
Of course --
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Affirmative.
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Sheldrake?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
You all right? What's the matter?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Of course not.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
What's her first name?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
You are?
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
No, I don't.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
Mind if I come in?
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Who?
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
I am?
Oh, yes. Thanks.
Sir?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
I got kicked in the head, too.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
Who is Mickey?
No.
Family?
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
The party's over.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Come on, Fran.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I don't believe you.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Yeah, we better.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
What gives?
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
It's a thought.
See if they'll what?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Dreadful.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
North ?
What unit were you with ?
Yeah.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
Smoke !
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
I never heard about that.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
A lame ?
Captain?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
You've gone crazy.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
Were you with him, when...
What's that?
Are you finished surfing?
You hear it again?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
When?
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
Captain Willard?
What is this bridge?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What's a big question?
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Where's your chief supply officer?
Beverly Hills --
20   CONTINUED:  
184  CONTINUED:
How long have you been up north?
She's dead.
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
It's exactly what you meant.
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
I'm here to do my job.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
I need to rent a cabin.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
What are you talking about?
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
Go easy.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
How was it talking to him?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
I know. He's just the best.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What about your mother?
I'm not kidding.
I want you to go on this trip.
You take off when you have to.
I was going to do that for you.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Stop asking everyone.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
This one has a special meaning.
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
Okay to say something now?
Because...
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
Well...
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
I've got to sketch you.
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Good evening.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Would you leave now, please?
Another place where?
Did you like it that much?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where you from?
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
So what happens now?
How did he know?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Ten million --
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Right.
Why?
Why?
The C.I.A.?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
No, they didn't.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
The exotic women.
Because you are a women.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
Okay.
Where did you learn it?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Ten years later, here you are again.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Yes.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I thought it was interesting --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
I prefer it like this.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
All the time.
Why not?
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
Go ahead.
Anything.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
What are you having?
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Because it's in English?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
We're going to need it all.
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
It just happened.
What are you on about?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Lucky break!
What do you want me to do?
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Take this exit.
Doug?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
You used to read.
What?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Can we charge admission?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
Ah, so what?
And take Jiri with you?
We_re not all running away
Shall I wash these out?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Hmm, I still owe him.
Enjoying our hospitality?
How do I know this isn't a trap?
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Go to hell!
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Very well.
Out with Belinda?
He wants to show now.
Thanks.
Landon!
I don't want to have any conversation.
-- This play means a lot to me.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Like you'd know.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
People can see.
All of it.
Yes. But not as a date date.
No.
You're acting like a crazy person.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Ergo?
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
Up to?
No.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I care for her.
This week.
So talk to us about something.
I thought she built it herself.
Yes. You?
For pay?
I'd work backstage or something?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
What do you want, Biff?
Uh, yes, sir...
Morning Dick.
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Fine.
Dad, you seen the drill?
Oh yeah.
No, Chinese food is fine.
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Why?
Your line, George!
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
What?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Catch you later! 
Then where the hell is he?
A gold mine?
Professor? Professor Brown?
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
What if you lost your keys?
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
That's all taken care of.
What do you call this? 
What? 
Catch!
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Can I be honest?
I don't care.
Is he upset?
Yeah.
I don't blame him.
That's Montana over there.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Planet 10?
Arachtoid.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
This is so embarrassing...
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
A what?
John Whorfin will kill us!
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Pick those up, Reno.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
So where's Buckaroo?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
...Who is this?
Hello, Barton.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Well that's what he said.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
He's a great writer 
A souse!
To do what?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
...That's fine.
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
Can be. Not easy, but 
...I don't guess this means much to you.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time 
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Hold on 
Yeah.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
...Where did we put him?
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
I  Mr. Lipnik 
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
All of which he's now missin'.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Excellent picture.
Take care, you hear?
How about the coke?
No.
Who?
No, Nick, please --
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Was there anyone with you last night?
Do you have a cigarette?
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
She wiped out her whole family.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Fine.
Yes.
No.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why not?
How did he die?
How's that?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
I hope I helped you out.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
What do you want?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Who are you?
What do you think?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Naa..
No.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I'm here.
They're just words.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
What are they?
A primate?
Yup.
Still not here.
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
You're shattering all my myths.
Your people.
Who's John Henry?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
I thought you hated this place?
You're back.
It's Monday morning.
... babies.
You mean babies with you?
Don't you think he's using you?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
I don't eat junk food.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
A what?
I need this?
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
What're you really after?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Y'mean take off our costumes?
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Y'mean frame him?
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
But I can't can I?
I love you, old man.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Umm-hmmmm.
What are you talking about?
Who's Ivy?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Like hell you do.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
It'll never work.
Maybe they're right.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
...Afraid.
What?
And another name for Mystery?
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Now black rubber.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Like normal folks.
He sure did.
And now....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
What?
I'm not-
Okay. I'm outta here.
Back off, man.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Holy shit.
About what?
A-14.
B-12.
A hit.
How high up would you say that is?
Take me. Let the boy go.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Do you sail?
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
No one would miss me.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Are they paying you for all this?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Go ahead.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
You're not going to ....
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Nope.
This sucks.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Huh? Huh huh.
Well where is she?!
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Bunghole...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Where are his pants?
She sure does.
Cool, huh huh huh.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
No, Jane.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Two hours.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
Little black party dresses?
3:30 I guess.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
So can I?
Help vouchers?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
All right.  Who are you?
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
Our cemetery?
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
What about Betelgeuse?
No, dummy.  Two.
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
That's it!
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Why not?
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Are they suffering?
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
It wasn't a joke.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
<u>Oh my God</u>!
You don't have a key?
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Oh, fine.
An attorney?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
In a day or two, yes.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes.
Yes. I am.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
May I ask your name?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
He does...?
... Good night, Chauncey.
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Yes. I was.
What is that?
Chauncey...
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Sir?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Please, sir.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Try again.
No headaches?
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
No, sir.
Right, Chief.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
I never played a jewel thief.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
I have to go back.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
What about Maxine?
Yes.
And he was with her.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
I need a shower.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
I am a trained performer.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Yessir.
Dr. Lester...
Moving story.
The usual, Barry.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
My tits?
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
You're evil, Maxine.
Lotte, this is so good...
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
No you mustn't, my child.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Do you mind?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
You mean with Malkovich?
I'd love to see your work.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Your mother all right?
Well, good luck with the job.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Oh.
What you want'em for?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
You was friends.
Ella.
That's so.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
You remember your price, Stamp?
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
She was only-
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
She left me. She's gone again.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Yes sir.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Shit.
Yeah.
What's this?
Where you going, Dude?
What--
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Uh-huh.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Heh-heh--
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Excuse me?
Yeah, but my-
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
No it's fine, really, uh--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Well...yeah--
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Delayed after-eff--
Uh-huh.
What do you do for fun?
Finder's fee?
No, but--
Am I wrong!
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey Walter--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Wooden bridge, huh?
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Now Dude--
They're nihilists.
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Who the fuck is that?
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
No.
Is this your homework, Larry?
And the fucking money!
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Walter Sobchak.
Yeah?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Am I wrong!?
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Whatta we do about the Mex?
He's half yours, partner.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Each day is a little life.
Why do you hate us so much?
How does it look?
Did you think I wouldn't?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Nomak?
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
What the fuck you doing?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
She's been bitten.
Going somewhere?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
No longer.
You're too human, Blade.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
You're hurt --
Just get out of here.
Is he sick?
-- tearing me -- apart.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
That's weird --
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Why do you hunt them?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Jesus.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Does it hurt?
So lemme see it.
--which'd be about ten bucks--
What?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
No.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Where's Domini?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
Be it still alive, James?
--turn the camera off--
--Graduate Thesis--
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Elly Kedward?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Finally got her back to sleep.
--I know!
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Your mother's pastor.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Ray?... What time is it?
...What's going on with you two?
...Where is everything?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
So how long have you know Meurice?
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
What night is it?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...Just doin' my job.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...Anything else?
I didn't say that.  Well?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Howdy stranger.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Jeffrey?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, baby.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey nothing.
THEN WHAT?
Yes.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Oh shit.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Falling.
No. I should go.
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me. don't you?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Oh no.
It's okay. it's okay.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
No thanks. what does that mean?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So. what's next?
That sounds good.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Okay. okay.
Shoot.
Oh yeah?
You like mysteries that much?
What was that all about?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Probably not. no. Why?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Look Jeffrey.
Hi Dad.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
No. No thank you.
That sounds great!
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
On the plane.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
What?  Yeah, sure.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
For calling you a homo.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Diego Delgado, please?
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Where do I put this!?
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Coke.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
It would be my pleasure.
I want money.
Dad.
Hi.
You're not going to trial?
I meant every word of it.
Do I know you?
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
Where are you going?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Swear on my life.
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Stoned?
So?
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Sid Ahmed.
I don't do that kind of thing.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
A name?
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Why?
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
An inquiry into what?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Cause?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Who found him?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Intense.
And how are you now?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Did you ever see her again after that?
I was angry.
No.
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
No.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
We dated for about a month last year.
Did he make your life miserable?
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
That bastard!
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Yes.
P.M.
Why'd you come here?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
Yes.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Yes.
Why not?
What do you think?
Yes -- she did.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Really?
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Hello?
I am relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
Why don't you talk to him now?
What's wrong?
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
That's too bad.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
It's not that long.
SO!
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
Well, I can help.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Don't say that!
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Not yet. You want to go?
I never knew that.
Was this during Betty?
Did we want to?
Madge?
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
About a year and a half.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Why?
And clean.
We got engaged.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
You get used to it.
You want to go back in?
Francesca?
Yes.
You must get lonely at times.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
But it's not the same.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
What made you ask such a question?
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
How about Bari?
I bet you could do a book.
Uh-huh. And?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
How do you know what I experience?
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
What about your husband?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm positive.
Okay.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
About an hour ago.
Apparently just before her death.
It clearly states in the will --
He yours, sir?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
We can climb out.
That's what?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Those 'fools' are my people.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Just try it.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Patrick, he's...
I can't find you.
You got the shit?
Where is it?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Please...help me...
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
You was just doing your job.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
You want to get into this now?
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
They were early.
You can't leave.
What happened to them?
It's not here, Caesar.
You need the money just like we do.
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
Another time.
Are you okay, Violet?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Who?
Are they really?
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Truck.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
How long have you been with him?
Five years is a long time.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Even though he knew about you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
He does it right in front of him.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
What if he sees you?
Not Caesar.
Why?
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
-- he went inside! --
What do you want to do?
What do you mean?
What is Treadstone?
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
That's all I get?
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
Right.
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes.  Is he there?
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride out of here.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I don't know.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
I needed a break.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
Think I could rent a scooter?
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
What?
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
...ervices.
You telephone, sir.
What have you got there?
Sign here, please.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
You sound worried.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Triplets.
Enough though, eh?
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
What's she done?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Trust me.
Bastard!!!
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Ow! That hurt!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Where are you taking me?
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
Looking for you.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Get away!
Shit! The house is on fire!
What?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
I delivered it.
I never signed the form.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
You want to take my console into your office?
Sod it, it's broken!
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
My I.D. cards.
I don't know which numero.
Now look what you've done to him.
But we can get one.
What?
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Are you expecting anyone?
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
What if there is no tomorrow?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
What about Kanita?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Sure, sure, give go.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Our Lady of Misery.
He's working a double shift.
He's better, isn't he?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Who is it?
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
Who's that?
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
I quit! I'm through!
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
No.
These are hard times, Tom.
Mr. Oh.
Why?
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Don't push it, Larry.
Mr. Oh.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
How <u>you</u> doing?
It's not loaded.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
What did they do with you?
Okay.
He excels at gratitude.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Okay.  Great line at the end.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Yes.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
How'd it go?
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
I think you're the Devil.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Yes.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
No...no.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I like "godsend."
That actually goes on...
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
So great -- right?
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
One year...almost one year.
How's it going?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
It's not important.
Who?
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Then give me a minute...
I got promoted for things like that.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
What are you doing here?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Oh it's enough...
Um...
A girl with a body like mine?
Walter can I ask you something?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
I mean, you look so pretty.
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
That's word for word.
Are you trying to be funny?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
You're gonna shoot me!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
I saw your...cat.
After that we go no more!
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Well, um... litter?
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
You didn't like them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Hi, Buffy.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Hi.
Is that your car?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Not exactly.
Yeah.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
I'm going to the senior dance.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
Bugs.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Cramps?
Wait a minute.
Who we gonna beat?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
Fine.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
I can't work this.
I want to die.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
That is so cool.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Hi, guys.
What's happening?  What do you want?
The mark of the Coven.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
No --
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Smell of booze much.
Like you've got a grip.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You can learn to like it.
What?
Switch nostrils?
No.
I'll tuck you in.
I did.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
I got released.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
You need a nickname.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
You a God damn witch?
Will that work for me?
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Well, I held it like an egg.
He did know.
You been in the Majors?
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
What?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
What's wrong?
Why am I a fuck?
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Crash Davis?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Don't try me.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
She's playing with my mind.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Where's Ebby?
Struck out eighteen...
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Where does he go?
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Thank you.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
That's right.
Was I at that dinner?
This is a very auspicious occasion.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
702 472 1862.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
When did this happen, honey?
Eight.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
Ohh!
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
Just say so.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Please...
Practice enough this week, you prick?
No, a...
Why?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
I -
I just told you. She called me.
How'd you know I was here?
Well...
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
I...
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Why not make them happy?
To Abraham Lincoln.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Ginger's mission in life was money.
Hey, Mitch.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You can trust me.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
I don't need one.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Okay?
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Oh...
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
I am not!
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
All right, I will, I will.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
No.
Well, I... I never tried.
Excuse me.
Is this yours? Your pen?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Get out of here.
Yeah?
You can't talk to me like...
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
Fucker!
Go get a bag, man.
Pitch-black?! It -
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Leave me alone!
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
He's comin' over.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
What? What?
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Is that what you want?
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
What about my money?
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Okay?
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Yes, don't worry.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Stacy. 
Mm.
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Charlie M?
My fuckin' head.
Again!
That's enough.
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
In women?
Guilty. I am.
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I've been looking for you.
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
I don't know what came over me.
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
And stop with the directions.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
My name is --
Don't lay this on me!
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
Who?
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What are you doing now?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
A woman?
Hey drop it, okay?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Pictures.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
She's gone --
What do you mean?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
No.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
God, if he doesn't come back --
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Whose money is this?
You timed that beautifully.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Why are we stopping?
Both hands on your lap.
Know what else is in here?
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
You're making it too easy.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
Some loyalty.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Sure.
I don't know what you mean.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
And not a nickel.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
What does it take to kill you?
How far off are you?
How do you know?
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
Who are you?
Government business?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
How?
What would you call it?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He's still looking, Col.
Don't be like that --
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
Fuck off, Dave.
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
That should make her happy.
You on the game?
No, I didn't --
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
What look?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Must be in love to manage that.
He was different.
Maybe.
Is this an obsession of yours?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
I didn't mean to hit you.
So I'm sorry.
So they do know.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
You want another haircut, baby?
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Stop it, Dil --
Got to be somewhere.
What's Fergus?
Yes.
Promise?
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
That's wise, Tommy.
See does he want some.
Leave us, Judie.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
And then you'll leave her out of it?
You OK about that?
Why do you want to do that for?
Would make me feel better about it.
Definitely unusual.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Can't.
Why can't we?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
What the fuck am I doing here.
What the fuck were you doing here?
Why did you sign up?
How different?
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
See? I was right about you.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Depends on what you believe in.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Come and get me, soldier --
What are you talking about?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Why?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
I love you, Adam.
Can you remember anything at all?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Of course there is!
But I didn't kill anybody.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Agent.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Oh, I see.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
No, what?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Carson Dyle is dead.
You can't.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Reggie -- listen to me --
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Why can't you be serious?
The phone's ringing --
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
I think Tex did it.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Shut the door!
You mean, you're a thief?
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Please keep it.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Oh, la.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
Why, do you think we're going to?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
What your husband was mixed up in.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Words can hurt very much.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Please stop -- please!
He knows everything.
I've never seen him before.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
What's he up to?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Shoot no, not after all these years.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You're grounded Friday night!
You found her?
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Why?
Who's?
_ Your father raped someone?
Why?
No! That's his table.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
You ok?
Mark invited me to the party.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Don't you think it's sick?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
Hi mom.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Yes?
Kenny's aunt?
Did you want one?
Let me just ask you a serious question first.

...shit.

...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
A little early for a delivery.
That's my business.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Uh, huh?
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...ya?
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
You want cash?
That dog was mean before I met him.
...up.

...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...I'm not the psycho.
...-cho and a hijack-...
I did not steal the truck.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Back up!  Back...
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
God, man!
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on...
Whoo!
Ho, ho...
 ...shit!

 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
...yeah.
...here!
I don't want you to come anyway. 

 All right.  Hey.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...shit.
...-er.  It was your friend...
Yeah.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
 
We're gonna die!
Oh.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Forty-five seven!
Okay...
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Shoot me. 
Patriotism is its own reward.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
I feel faint.
I was undercover as a tennis player.

To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
Listen, shithead!
I did what I could for you...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
...to be off the island tonight.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
Andrew...

You look good, Richard.
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...and the government.
...you were right, of course.  But after...
...happen if I drop this?
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
I'll do it.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?



Of which we have more than enough.
There.
It's clean.
Get your links set up!
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
That's right.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...noon.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Where's their protective...
Assumptions are always...
I beg your pardon?
I want you to look at one another...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
You try anything, it goes in...

Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
I can handle it.
Uh, we both like to fish.
It's after five...
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.

Excellent.
...like a fish.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...back...
...-to a simple thing like...
How much longer for the range and power projections?
...-lem?
...you answer mine.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
Just go check the temperature.
The Army, sealin' us in.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay, doc.

 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
It doesn't hurt.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
My daughter.
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
She's fine.
What is it?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Curly, where's your car?
You sure this is okay?
I don't want it anymore.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
What are you doing here?
Isn't that your number?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
It's too late.
I know what he says.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
That's it?
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Do you know where she might be?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I'll stop by.
I have?
Where you were when your husband died.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
We got it. We got it, baby.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
...No. Why was it.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
It's possible.
What about?
You mean she just found out?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
There's just one question.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
I don't understand.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Mr. Gittes?
What about the water?
It's not completely dry.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
...Yes of course.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
She ran away?
You don't say?
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Why? What do you mean?
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Father, I have sinned...
I don't care. I'll wait.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
I can't take shorthand.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
But, Mr. Kane -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
It can wait.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
Charlie, please don't -
You're very easily amused.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
At night?
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
It's been a tough day.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Charlie -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
I know you will.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Thompson!
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
That's it, everybody out.
I take it she likes the guy.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Well... kind of, sort of?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
You're such an asshole.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Like you're better!
Are you open?
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
Cute cat. What's his name.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
What time do you have to stay till?
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
No, thanks.
You don't want to know.
You win.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
I think it's safe to say yes.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
So they build another Death Star, right?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
So?
Perfect dozen.
The quest isn't going well?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
No.
Thirty-seven!
Sorry.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Oh, my god.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
You hardly knew her!
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
That's embarrassing?
His dick was in his mouth?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Her fucking body fell out!
I want to rent a movie.
What's that for?
Five hundred dollars.
Really?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You're a snake.
There's no lights back there.
Around three or something.
What time did we go to the funeral?
This life?
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Are you open?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
She's my girlfriend.
Meaning?
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
You're kidding.
What were you doing?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Ooh! Can we?!
I was kidding.
How do you figure?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
You've only had sex with three different people?
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Something like thirty-six.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
What did he say?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
It was only a few times...
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
It stings a little.
You open?
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
He only speaks Russian?
I hope it feels good.
You'll be missed.
How long you gonna be here?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
The guy ain't here yet.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Surprise me.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
She's losing it!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Fine, I guess...
Patience my love, patience.
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
We spent a night there one night...
Where've you been?
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Resuscitation?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Flare up of old emotions...
He doesn't want my help.
Gabe!?
For the same reason you did, to help.
Gabe...your arm?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Gabe are you alright?
No luck?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
This rope is sixty years old!
Never, what?!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
Just kidding.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Where's the helicopter?
What's he doing?
No, he's gone.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
You got what we need?
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
What did you do that for?
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Been punished, yeah?
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Good evening, sir.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Thank you, sir.
Surprise?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
I haven't seen you before.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
I just say what the other person would say?
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Sixth is faster.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
The ride is free.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
What are you gonna do?
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
It's nothing.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
...why is everything always about you...
You should start a union.
Yes.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Who's that?
I'm...what?  Sorry?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Let's go.
Limos, huh?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Dmitri?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
In case he asks.
No.
You had to kill Heller?!
Answer the question.
Why the hell not?
Look, I'm sorry --
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I better get going.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
Just relax.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Yeah.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
If my universe had a hub...
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Has this happened to you before?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
What van?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
We're going to Queens?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
I'm sorry.
Geronimo is down.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
You think it's a conspiracy?
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Terminal?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Working.
Working.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Agent Lowry.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
Hope there's a cartoon.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Pepsi?  Tequila?
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
That isn't the way it works.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Ellie.  Arroway.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
What...?
Ellie, what is it?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
I do.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
No.
Please! Please!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Borrowin'.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Well, whatta we got here?
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Oh Lord!
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man, it's so hot.
Kick a buck.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
He'll never make it.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
You're fired.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
What pattern was that?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
She's supposed to have it.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
That's no surprise.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
Yes.  I have to go...
Yes.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
What about her arms?
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
Look at her legs.
Oh, maaaaan?!
You're damn right I do.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
You got a suspect...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I did this already.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
Just go ahead and tell us.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Tomorrow?
There's a spider in my room.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
Letty.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
What else would you do?
Tell the doctor.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
And all the plans we have.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Can you loan me a 20?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Getting back.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Where did they go?
It's me...
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
No.
Oui.
Where's your brother?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
-- Super what?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
But you were there?
Tonight?
Because you're the closest.
What for?
That moron.
You're sure?
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Hadley --
I will.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Why haven't you turned us in?
How much?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Good song though.
I was told to take what we have and go.
You guys used to work together?
Get in the car.
What happened?
Mr. Zammito?
Yeah.
How are we going to do that?
I think we went the wrong way.
How do we know what room she's in?
I can't even hear myself think.
And how do we do that?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
I didn't have the heart.
Do you think you are a real master?
You're home late... or should I say early?
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Let them look.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
No.
No, not yet...
She needs direction... and training.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Shu Lien...
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
It's Jade Fox!
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
Does she have a name?
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
I'll be fine.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
Oh really?
A friend wrote me.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
About what?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Thank you.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
That's repulsive.
It was fine.
Yes.
Yes it does.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
I have feelings for you.
Yes.
I just came to say goodbye.
Please don't go.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
Where did you say she's from?
Greg McConnell.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
What was that?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Do you want to learn or not?
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Does your mother know?
It's like a secret society.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You do?
Yummy.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Positive.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
You can put it anywhere.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Have you succeeded in your task?
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Morning!
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
Where is she?
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I've never done this before.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Do you know where she is?
Did she show up?
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
What do you mean?
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
What's her name?
Irena.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Can't you tell me later?
Now Amy
It's true.
Daddy!
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
Irena. But who are you?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
This is more fun than just pretend.
That one's an elm.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Don't cry, Amy.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Who is she?
Why hasn't he got a head?
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Let the child stay.
And Amy mailed them?
Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
What?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Does she have PMS?
Maybe he's just shy.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Can't you get contacts?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
I wonder if he's married.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Charming Carlton.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Tuesday. Are you okay?
And he was missing an arm.
What happened to his tooth?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
DON'T call the police.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
What choice do we have?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
Knock what off?
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
This really isn't a good time.
So pay them back and apologize.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Briefs.
Was there anything in that washer?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Worse than this?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I think I'm a werewolf.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
I need something to keep me awake.
What is this place?
Sorry, sir.
Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Why give yourself up?
Don't know that either.
They didn't have faces.
What?
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Which one?
Where does it lead?
What does she say?  The woman.
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
It's a trick.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
No more than the usual.
Dave...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What do you think you're doing?!
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
And...
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Clean.
Check his kids.
Clean.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
What's with the cameras?
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
What I told him to?
Dave -- I'm working.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Extend things?
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.
Thanks, I wrote it.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
What?
President vetoes works bill?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Oh... Thanks.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Yeah.
You're not?
What?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
`Bleed for your king.'
The Vice-President...
What?
That was quite a thing you did today.
They asked me to help.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
Quiet!
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Gasparilla?
That sounds like a curse to me.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
What you wanna do?
Oh, I have no doubt.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Mary.
Tricks...Jesus...
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
I told you, that's a secret.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
I'm not?
Doing fine, sir.
Where'd you find them?
No.
What happened?
Chris!
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Yes sir.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I'm sorry, Neil.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Nothing.
Oh..
What the hell are you talking about?
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
I'm not a thief.
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
I don't know where it is!
How do you know that?
Looking good...
Yeah...
So?
Joey...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
She fucked me.
Damn right!
Here's to huntin'.
They did too!
Tell him, Vince!
He's real bad, Nick.
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
No, I --
See, I'm going home.
No. None of that.
You mean...?
She's in back.
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Hey, Nick...
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I don't know.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You seem... disturbed.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
You can do it, Sal.
No. No, no.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Nick, he just came back.
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What do you think?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
What?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Did you go hunting.
You didn't get a deer?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Yeah?
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Sir, your limo's here.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
You my partner?
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
How do I look?
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
You could always take it off.
I'll take it.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
Belle --
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
I didn't.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
Why? It don't hurt.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Grandma, look at me!
She couldn't be gone!
I do -- and I think you should too.
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Headache -- Squire?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
We can still use my butter money.
We must go on home, Jabez.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I'm serious.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Isn't that your own fault?
But Jabez, I never said that!
Why don't they come --
What's ailing that dog?
I dunno.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Do you really think that?
Hello, Sheriff.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Mary -- Jabez --
What's that?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Jabez ...
Hullooo!
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
You mean -- a jury trial?
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
I wanted to give it all to the church.
I'm John McClane.
But meant her moving here.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
No, sir.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
'Roy'.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Well.... huh ...
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
That's it.
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
You don't have a choice?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Are they on the phone still?
Yeah... yeah!
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
What do you want to know that for?
I frisk you?
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
You're full of shit ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
I want to talk to him.
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Okay, is the vault open?
It's all we got.
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
What?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
You like me?
Sure - we like you.
I'm sorry.
We like you, too.
What is it, Sam?
Did you always call him Junior.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
He wants one.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
What kind of a deal?
Wyoming.
Yeah ...
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
What'd he say?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Hello?
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Okay.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
I've already formulated a plan.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Must you use that awful word?
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
I be.  I'm living large.
I don't like anything else.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
I thank you.
I didn't.
What makes Sammy run?
Yeah, me too.
I'll do.
D, not C.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Depends.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
How long then?
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
What else?
Trust me.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
What?
Just coolin'.
Shaddup, Vito.
You deaf or what?
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
I didn't think so.
But I came here to learn about America.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
What?
No, I'm fine thanks.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Home school? What's that?
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
The second R is silent.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Who's Captain Rob?
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
But-
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Are, too.
Hey, it's Jessica.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
You had some questions.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Can you believe it?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
That's the downside. There is none.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
He passed away three years ago.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
It's a surprise.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
We have just folded space from Ix...
I can assure you...
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
Don't touch my mother...
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
Man-carved steps.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Why do they come?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Did they try and fail?
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
The <u>women</u>?
Do you want me to get it for you?
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Goulash.
"It is my home."
You'll be sitting on the right.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
So why didn't you do it?
But maybe not.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Last night was quite a romp.
Rolling.
Wow.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Will he be okay?
This is my way of telling you --
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
I don't know.  It's so much money...
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Goddamn landlord.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's not true --
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
I think you're quite handsome.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
I got married last night.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Well you tried --
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Yeah...?
You're sure this is gonna work?
What octopus motor?
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
What if--you're vomiting?
Do they show it?
How's your mother?
This is real, Bananahead!
You think she really likes him?
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Excuse me.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Uh-huh?
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Where are you going?
Really? They were..
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Yeah?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No. It's a mess.
Both.
Mom?
What's the matter?!
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
What's going on over there?
Hi. Is Shari here?
She won't.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Our what?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Right.
What do you want?!
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
I wish my stepfather was here.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Shari...
Everybody's someone.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Who is it?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Hi, Shari.
Who's Shari?
What...
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Good?
How?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Anything wrong?
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
You're kidding, right?
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Hey, that's super
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
I guess you know why you're here
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Hello, Mr. M.
Where to?
Yes?
I hope so
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Hmm?
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
More this way.
Shall we give it a name?
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
And she's super-nice
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
What?
I'm not like you.
These are private -- these are for us.
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
You fuck for money.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
I'm not sure.
Captain, what do you want?
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
You know him?
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
What's through here?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Let's just kill them.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
What little studio?
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
But you were business associates?
The youngest applicant by eight years.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Bud White's been here?
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
How was I?
None.  Call it a hunch.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
And Reynolds?
Shut up!
Have we met before?
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
I just gave him my card.
Listen to me--
Clear as day.
I'll come straight there.
It is?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
What if--
And you won't. Now move--
I called my wife!
I called from a payphone!
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
How'd you have the manpower to--
They come after you?
What do you think?
The NSA killed him.
What the fuck?!
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
What are you dialing?
With what?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Yes. I have her permission.
What size?
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Did he give you anything?
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
Sorry.
He's got his priorities?
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
Yes.
You don't know who the fuck--
DePinto?
He doesn't work that way.
How can I be sure.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I'm sorry about that.
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
You're firing me.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Can I open 'em up?
Alright!
They didn't take the silverware?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Why would the NSA--
Listen to me.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
I need help.
Are you still in Crystal City?
I said fuck you.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
We found the originals.
Am I to understand--
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
When were you least happy?
What else?
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Don't leave me!
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
I was talking about the girl.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Are you Hana?
So you can shoot a pistol?
No.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Apprentices.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Really?  That's sudden.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
You get Hardy.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
What are you up to?
Will you come with me?
Kip I -
He can't even move.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
You've got a mustache.
Go away.
How awful.  What will you do?
What about your rank or serial number?
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
How close?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Mr. MacDougal.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
Well, no...but...
I know.
What the hell was that?
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
You stole my luggage? You--
That's entrapment.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
Did I hear a car?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
So how long to pop the floor?
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
They moved it.
We did it.
What?
Your share.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
What's that?
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
You can't be serious.
No way to take another day or two?
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Not for me.
They drive so recklessly there.
Relax, don't jam it...
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
He looks familiar.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
Right.
You're giving them to me?
I figured that out.
Probably not.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Yeah.
And get someone to help around the house.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rsum, make an --
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
What are you doing here?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Course I did.
And you can't?
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
I like this case.
Really?  It makes me sick.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
What's a demur?
She insulted me!
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
So why would PG&E offer it?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Why not?
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
When'd they file the demur?
Who's the judge?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
You're married.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Have you been to the water board?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
It happens all the time.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Annabelle Daniels.
You want my number?
You got more than one?
No.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
That's Ed.
You already packed up your stuff?
They up?
Someone stole my stuff.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks a blue streak.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
I think we're in trouble.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
You don't look angry.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
It's a lovely outpost.
What about Han?
What's going on?
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
We've got to find Luke.
What?
Someone's falling.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
Do you have a name?
Believe what?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
And we can watch ...
With food?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
What are they doing here?
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
Please
Cuervo...?
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
You told me he was dead.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
See you in hell, Snake.
Defense against what?
No.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Where'd they go?
Location.
I said pull over.
Yeah, kinda.
Where?
Don't follow me.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
Snake - what is it?
Move aside!
Yield. I have the advantage.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
A king must marry, after all.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Excalibur! Is it true?
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
It is.
A lovestruck page!
You are truly magnificent!
No, he's working on another book.
It's-
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Just five or six people.
Phonograph.
Not that I know of.
Groceries maybe? A package?
Want to ask him?
Fine thank you.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Never.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Could you see her?
No.
Please.
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Oh look at that.
You know how?
Captain who?
Captain Howdy.
He's nice.
But you like him.
Well I heard differently.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Lieutenant?
Do you like films?
Quod nomen mihi est?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Only what I read in the papers.
Really?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Unlikely.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Who?
Fuck him!!!
I don't know.
Why not?
You're not going to drive.
Honey ...
They're falling out.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
What d'ya got?
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
You look awful.
Really.  You sleeping?
This time you gotta go.
We don't get a gig.
Nice, huh?
What was it like?
What's that?
Let's get it over with.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
What's the matter?
You hit me.
See anything?
Make it collect.
Okay.
All night?
Why would I mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
What the hell are you doing?
What?
Expensive hangover.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
Yeah.
The tenth's out.
What?
Fuck you.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Go ahead.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Spur of the moment.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
The flu.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Where's my name?
That!  You can't wear that!
They're tight.
Maybe it's legit.
You're kidding me.
Hey, will you look at that?
Uh ...
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Funny job.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Yeah.
All right.  Hold on.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
What'd I say?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
I didn't want to wake you.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Guess they're up.
Why not?
Yeah?
Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
What did he do?
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
My place.
Is that what you think?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Go on.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
-- Castor?
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Castor's escaped!
What happened?
You merciless bastard!
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
-- Yes.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
You have kids, Jack?
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
What about me?
No.
They did a pretty good job.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
I think I could figure it out.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Damn...
Hey, is that really necessary?
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
Cmon Jack...
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Me?
Miss me, Jack?
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Like the dress...?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Jack...dont even start...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
How can you do that?
No?
Jack.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
I want to see you again.
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
How long was I out?
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
We had a tough year.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
What's wrong with me?
What is this?  Where's Reed?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben did this.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
And take a little trip with them...
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
We must!
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Such as?
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
But that isn't possible.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
At an operation?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
That line was tampered with...
Looks like somebody declared war.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
What do you mean?
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
No Jean, no money!
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
That's right. And we need more money.
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
End a April.
Oh sure.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Uh-huh... A what?
Yah.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah, that can happen.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Yah!
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Well... yah.
Yah, pretty good.
Whatcha watchin' there?
We might be innarested.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Ya see something down there, Chief?
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Uh-huh.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Yep.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Yah?
Was it reasonable?
Uh-huh.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
Well -
I'm tellin' ya.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Does this sound strange to you?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Practicing what?
Looks like this is goodbye.
Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
You feel nothing?
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
When?
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
Is this a trick?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Answer the question!
Marla...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
You are an insane person.
My God, you're shot...
Tell the other person how you feel.
It's getting exciting now.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
I guess so.
Is it?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
What?
Okay.
Look at your hand.
... Marla ... ?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
What are we doing?
What should I have told you?
Four in Milwaukee.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
Tyler...
Why what?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Robert Paulson?
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
Want me to drive?
What is it?  What are you?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
It's only the end of June.
4:25.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
I'll remove him.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Fag.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
You guys are real... aren't you?
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
What do you call that?
Batteries not included.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
I'm getting him out.
You comin'?
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Intelligence work.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Where?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
How long have you been setting up?
I know.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
Hello, John.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Most men are.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
Hello....congratulations.
What if I was a relative?
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
.....Me neither.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Fine.
No, I have to work.
A list.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Free?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
<u>What</u>!?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Who?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
You a fag too?
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Excuse me...
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
A wig?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
You said.
You just going to sit there?
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Sure you don't want anything?
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Where are you going?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Well, you seem very professional...
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Uhm hmm.
Hello...
Yes, intentionally.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
You think I'm a fake.
No, it isn't what I think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
No, don't do that...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Four or five years.
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
It is true.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Pardon me?
Do you have a name?
I kissed those girls.
Why?
Wha'?
What are you going that way for?
Pitt.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
I gotta go take a piss.
She lives near Eddie?
Yo! What you goin' for
How old is he?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
So what do you want with her anyway?
Would you like me to change anything?
You mean her.
Maybe tonight?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch!
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
This one's going to be even more fun.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Just relax.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
Gum thought Brazil.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
I'd have been long gone.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Has he?
Where are you going?
They bust you every week.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
I have the same problem with my help.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Did you hear something?
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Thanks.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Cute young thing, too.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
He never sees them and I never met them.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
They just left, sir.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
No wonder.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
She moved out.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
Just give me a hint, all right?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Have what?
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Spooky.  I'll process her.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Ah, an obvious choice.
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Aha, just what I suspected!
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Why are all these people after me?
Ick.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
It's me.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
That's cute.  You're funny.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Mr. Doyle.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Doesn't register.
What?
Sal --
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Le sommes nous?
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
What's your story?
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
For garbage?
I been damn careful up to now.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
It looks open on the other side.
How about a little of the King?
He did.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
I'm off.
Wish you weren't.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
It's Mom.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
I'll be damned.
Whatta we do now?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
What?
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Got a minute?
Sounds good.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
So how'd you like LION KING?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Who the fuck is this?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
What is that?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
Who brought up this bright idea?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
You're all just jealous.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
I'm a slow eater.
Which one is it?
Your bed.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Is that so bad?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Did you stay here last night?
Why did you come back here?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Is... is everything all right?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Why?
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Oh, jeez.
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Which is?
I've seen it.
Hello...
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
That's very colorful, chief.
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
About what?
About Jessica.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Steven!
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
But she might be in trouble...
No thanks.
Time to check out the waiters.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
What a beautiful day.
I'm staying.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
We must abandon.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
Is it safe?
He'll hate it.
Had to be him.
What are you talking about?
What are we talking about?
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
What about her?
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
What?
We're able to surprise each other.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Do you want to get some coffee?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
I have a class. I'm late.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
What else?
Mystery. Deception.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Who the hell cares?
I'd forgotten that.
Alma Wetzel.
People are dependable.
I'm at the door.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
They're only gonna lose.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I lost it. I lose everything.
A grandmother. God bless you.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
You're a family man, Frankie?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
I don't know.
Washed away.
Don't worry. It's a test.
They're my team.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
I hate the Mets.
Yes, Peter.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What color?
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Engaging.
Is it true?
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Are you sure?
You mean Gandhi?
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
And Jinnah?
A great deal.
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
Who is that young man?
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
What are you waiting for?
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
It's about the Director.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
Where are we going?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
German, is that you?
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
No bother.
No.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
You didn't know?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
I've got enough here.
Flight got you nervous?
Hi.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
How was it?
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
What about the bank?
They checked in.
There are three men dead.
A man helped me open it...
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
Okay?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
All right. Shells?
Yeah. I got out.
What about the vault?
Then you do it.
How was that?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
What did he say?
What name?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Though nicer than most?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
And what was that?
What kind of entertaining?
Then he must have pulled her.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Yeah.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
You sod.
That little shit!
Eric. Eric Paice.
Meaning what?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
That's right, Harry.
Three hundred altogether?
...they hold on to their money...
To get on the...
It is.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Starting up.
That's what I...
What could somebody get for them?
We're just "talking" about it.
As an idea.
You're actually talking about this?
A buck a shot.
Me?
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
You went for it.
You need money?  Is that the...
And why is that?
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yes.
Were the leads...
A waste of time?  Why?
They aren't?
Why don't you think so?
Where was I?
Did they...?
Who used to say that?
I don't know, George, why?
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Go to lunch, will you...
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
The people downtown said...
You're done, come down, and let's...
Shelly, you blew the last...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
I wish I could.
You want something off the B list?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Mmm.
What?
What are you talking about?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
Don't.
...yes...
Yes.
Which...
No, his wife is.
I'm sorry...?
Mm.
Ricky, I...
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
I don't understand.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Tuesday.
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
And the check is...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You going to turn State's?
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck you.
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
I'm going home.
Did they...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They took some of the con...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
I can't.
To do business.
I can help you.
I'm not hungry.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Would you like some?
You would risk your life for strangers?
He will grow strong.
Oh, 'scuse me.
I never met them.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
It was hard to have him killed.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
What?
Chi?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
You're going to talk to him now.
Me too, Tom?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
I asked about Fredo?
And Kay...she's all right?
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
What's up?
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
No strings.
Do you owe markers?
Is he related to the witness?
This meeting is adjourned.
I had no idea...
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Why too late?
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
His brother came to help him.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
You would have killed his brother?
No, I meant lose his family.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
We do favors for each other...
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
So?
Let him gamble.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
When do we talk?
You were unfair with them.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
I'm not a kid.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
No.  Iced tea's fine.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
You went to university?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
No.  I'm fine.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
I don't like to talk about that.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.
Can I see what you did so far?
But we have to match the other sketch.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
There's no people like you in my crowd.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
Do I have any other choice?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
What happened?
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Do you mind?
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
What are you doing here?
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
You didn't, Jimmy.
You only embarrass yourself.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
What about?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
What kind of job... ?
Jesus ...
What's with the fish thing -- ?
I'm just here about my brother.
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
And this has what to do with me?
I'm on the move -
I'll catch you later, Randall --
When'd you get to town, Raines?
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
Forget that ...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Whatcha got left ... ?
Any more ...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
About what?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
What are you doing here?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Mitch.
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
That what you want?
I take out my slim-jim...
Wrong preposition...
Where to -- ?
What are you doing... ?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Hello, Otto ...
Tell me...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
So what's in there -- ?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
My bag. My bag.
Jezuz Christ!
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Done.
He heard.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
No way! You're kiddin'!
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
It's a way outta here.
No, I had to talk him down.
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Come on, Will...
Chuck, let's go.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
You want us to give you cash right now?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
You're in a safe place, Will.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
No, there's a limit.
Which one's your building?
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Of course.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
Shall we start the, uh...
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Yes.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Uh-oh.
I'll be okay.
Tom.
You moved?
He married his cousin.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Come in.
Do you know when you'll be back?
What do you want to do?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
What?
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Nautilus?
Crayons?
No.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
I don't know.
Not to me, they're not.
Don't fuck with me.
Good for you. Congratulations.
See ya.
I'm Will.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Bullshit.
I've never seen your place.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Do you play the piano?
Come one Will. I just want to know.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Will? Are you awake?
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Why not?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
I'd come back--
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
People done it. If they could, we could.
Any gas?
I didn't see nothin'.
What's it to you?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Deputy sheriffs.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Anything like work aroun' here?
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
Think she'll hold?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Women is always tar'd.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Where you think you're going?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Don't taste bad.
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
You promised, Tommy.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
They know he got hit in the face.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
They gone.
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Whatsa matter?
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
You people looking for work?
Can you pick peaches?
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
What do you do?
It's what I do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
As long as I get the laugh.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No time.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
That's probably a good idea.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
I work alone.
Okay.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Hard to get good help these days.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
Well?
Wait a minute--
This is not good.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
What's a revival tent?
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
You have a headache?
Marty! It's me. Paul.
Ten years. What happened!?
What the hell happened to you?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
So how was your first and last day of branding?
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
You lived in Chicago?
A jogger, huh?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Ever think of moving there full time?
Everything under control?
I am comfortable.
Annie!
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Fine!
That's not true!
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
I should be in by two.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
What about Grace?
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Aw... that's so sweet.
You've got to stop doing that?
Why did you go?
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
No. I am a "tubab."
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Diane!
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
It's warmer than I thought.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
We still have a way to go.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Hold on a second!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Ta-da!
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Hmmm.
What did we learn in school today?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Shit! Come on!
That's Razor and Blade.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
What the hell are you doing?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah.
Kate, listen.
I know, I know who wrote it.
Ready?
Uhhhmm...
Excuse me.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
My name is the Plague.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Hey, it's me.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
What?
About what?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
How many people in the bus?
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Sure it does.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Why?
Where are you going?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
You're going to be late!
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
I can't.
Get him out of here!
I'm scared.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Go get me a beer.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
Come in, come in.
Yeah.
Oh!
And you, you-you're going?
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
How ya doin', man?
You--  Standards and Practices?
...with the affiliates.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Oh, God.
Yes.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
How's everything?
Elliot!
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Why?
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
I didn't sleep all night.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
You bet.
I want one with you.
No!
You matter to me.  Completely.
Yeah.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Want some coffee or tea?
Hmm?
Why?
No.
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
Oh, yeah?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
I think so.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Isn't that great?
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Ohh?
Here.  Be careful with those.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Uh-huh.
Oh, gosh.
Hmm!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
Yes, you do recall, right?
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Come on.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Really?
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Well, what about me?
Oh, well.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Right.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Hi.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Aren't you glad to see me?
And?
They're offering... 
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
...how are things at the Hospital?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
...they did it for a lark.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
..It won't be long now, sir...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
For a consideration.
Starling...?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
That could be.
I said sometime it gets so...
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
...how so?
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
And?  Then?
Darling...
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
What is that that smells so wonderful.
...but will that satisfy you?
The girl could use some help.
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
And why should we believe you?
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
She must be something special After Dark.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
...no.
...would you use a small word?
That's right.
Yes.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Fuck off.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
It's not my style, okay?
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
What do you want from me?
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
No way, no day!
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Perrier water!
Can't you see this is a special moment?
We're breaking up. I am out!
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
You going to eat this?
Cool off, we're seniors.
I guess.
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
That's three things.
But my name's not...
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
I'm not hungry.
sighs.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
gives her a sympathetic look.
looks startled at the outburst.
She's terribly hurt . . .
It doesn't matter.
This.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Pitbull attacks.
Sure plenty of times.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
I understand... I won't-
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Zero's a number right?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
What?
Never to put you in my will.
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
This game is over do you hear me?
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
Often, uh.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
Lie, you mean...
I... I know that, John...
Vietnam!
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
What is it?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
How'd it go?
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
She wants to quit?
It's not unthinkable.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
How are they with kids?
So where are all your toys?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
-- hospital.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Uh huh.
I found a cent!
Uh huh.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Here, take this out to the table.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Neil -- what --
What's that?
We're going to think about it.
Did you hear that?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
How long does it have to be a new house?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Oh God.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
God, your sister's really hot.
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Promise?
Lieutenant?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What is it?
We don't have any proof of that.
I think it was England.
Where were you last night around nine?
No.  I don't scare easy.
Sing.
What worries you?
I stood up first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
I cannot explain.
Then take me with you.
I remember you.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Where did you get it?
Who was that man last night?
You're twenty minutes late.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
I don't think it is a duplication.
You stayed here again last night?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Talley.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
You think we should take that chance?
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
I'm going to my desk.
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
I have to tell you something --
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
The cops are comin'!
I don't know.
You have his address?
How did you get this number?
All right.  Now the second one.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Where are they?
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
We, who is we?
Excuse me?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Anything. Strong.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
Their people?
What did you overhear?
What did they say?
Well rewarded Those were his words.
Get in.
What do you mean, General?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
When?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
You are a marked man.
) You cannot kill them all.
Very soon.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Promoted. House Manager.
What?
I will need a suite.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
He wants your wisdom.
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
But who is left?
Please, please try one more time.
A little longer, Paul?
I have to stay.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
More the merrier.
Melissa!
Three times, to be exact.
-- what was he doing here?
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
And we get this money when?
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Prove it.
Oh, Jesus....
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Or an on-line computer.
That's crazy!
Price!!
Don't think it's even an issue.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
What?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Where is she?
Jesus!
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
My wife. Where were we?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
House 2, Guests 0.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
I'll take my chances.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Pritchett: what is going on?
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
I'm sorry.
Well then who did?!
H-how long will it take?
She's here.
She's down.  Help her...
Can I have this room daddy?
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What the hell is that?
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Maura!
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
That's great.
I figured I'd make breakfast.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
Joey ... ?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Thank you.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Wow.  Thank you.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Joey?
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
You re not thinking of going to...
Count of three?
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
What have you been doing?
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Good job, not pretty, but good.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Don't be stupid...they...
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoopsucker!
Well, maybe I --
I'm happy enough.
Oh, no, really, I --
Confused?
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
I filed it yesterday.
Ya know, entry level!
Terrific.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Norville.
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
You don't believe in it?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
Yes -- on the boat.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
And charming?
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
What about her?
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Yeah, that one.
What's on your mind? Don't --
I'll drive you --
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
All right.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
Yeah?
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Huh?
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
It's what?
I saw you on your bike today.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Here you are.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
Now you are being rude.
Reverend Edwards.
Shit. You're not planning --
No candy for me?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Sure.  Twinkie?
Did you tell Sandy?
Mikey was looking for you.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Want a drink?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
I had him!
Yeah.  All over.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Thanks.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
No.
What time was that?
Randy Stetz?
To do nothing.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
What is it?
What if someone finds out?
Huh?
You heard me that time.
You want me to take you somewhere?
It was like some big fucking secret!
What was?
No game.
Thought you might find that.
But she was an attractive girl.
Yes.
Wild card.
Surely you know the one who made you...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
It will grow back again!
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You know her?
She's no vampire.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
But why do you want me?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
It's only a siren...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
You found nothing?
Yes...
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
What the hell would you call this?
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
But, he said he'd try.
Yes.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
I understand something.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
I love it here.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm okay.
What?
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
He is exhausted.
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
Well 
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
All the graves?
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
But one must love a father.
What would I be thinking?
Her name is Thea?
Theodosia.
How did she die?
You are my friend.
Well, tell, him.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Who?
Get that ladder up here.
Carter  bank examiner.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Go through with what?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
A boy?
What did you stop it for?
Not a soul.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Thanks.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
What?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
What's that?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Anything I can do back here?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
How's that?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Where are you going?
George, can I see you for a second?
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Eighteen.
Come on, tell me.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Mary! Mary!
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
Someone pop your balloon?
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Why'd they decide to move?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
But the island!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Good morning!
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Positive I.D.?
I know just where to go.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
You said something about a camera.
Too late, it's written.
Look at that:
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Late.
Fooling around?
Sean's awake.
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Nothing, huh?
All summer?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Where the hell is Air One?
When?
They made me go with them.
Help!  Help!
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Mike?  Our Mike?
It comes here from Cable Junction.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
He's going with you, Doctor.
Sure am.
Thank you.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
They just wanted to say hello.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
What's wrong?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Fine piece of engineering.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
They said you'd be here.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
I told you, something's upset them.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Why are you?
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Some miss all their shots.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Believe me, I am.
When did this happen?
Give me a ride?
So, you just get here?
How long you staying?
You were great out there!
The one that goes underwater?
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
What the hell's there?
How'd you do in school?
I want to see Kathryn.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
Come on, sweetheart....
Daddy, why can't I...?
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Turn it off....
Sweetheart....
It'll grow on you.
Henny Youngman....
We'll be there....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I'm hungry, Mom....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Okay.
Mom, please don't start that again....
Flies the plane....
I could take some time off....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I'll get it back next time.
You the architect?
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Still tagging conch?
Inch by inch....
I wish there was something I could do....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
The females have eggs....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Money is money....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
When we got the grant....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I don't like it....
You getting a reading on them?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
How come only me?
'A Moray eel....'
You told me what?
I've got to get to her....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
She's in management....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Oh no--
Is it your vehicle?
Did you bring it with you?
Be my guest. What you got?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
Well .. I didn't know that ..
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
What color was it?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
Ross told me.
Really? What did he say?
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I can't identify him ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
What are you doing, Travis?
You got a warrant for this?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
What does that mean?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Who told you?
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Hmm.  Pretty good.
You think so?
Wonder what he said.
... light.
We are?
Thanks.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Oh my God.
We will be fine!
Well.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Happy. He said "happy?"
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Oh good.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
That's the girl I love.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
What happened to Denver?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
At last I find you.
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
--  the kwan.
Forget it.  Forget it.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
How do I know?
I'm asking you a question --
No, you're --
Not everyone has what you have.
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
That's an answer.
I have to ask.
I'll go back to them.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
They do, my brother.
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
ERRR-IIIC!
Oh, my God.
What is it?
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
What?...WHAT!?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
They're here.
Anything good?
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
But then you never get to go in space.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
What kind of gun is that?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
You're going too?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Ask her.
Phones are out too.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Are you sure?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
They smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Why would they care what we think?
Oh, shit.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - barfs them up - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
C'mon on, this way.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Alan, listen to this.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Can we chance moving him?
Faster, faster!
Yes?
- - shut up.
He sends his apologies.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Are they heavy?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
So am I going to help you with your foot?
Straight-A brainiac!
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
The kids okay?
Tim!  Lex!
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
Go away!
I like cows.
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Fifty.
Chain saws.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Hello?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Quite a circus.
A house?
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
He wets the bed?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
Oh?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Yes -- we do.
I read the one about the penal colony.
You work in the cemetery.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
What an extraordinary request!
I gave it to him yesterday.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
In a small way.
No.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Your office is the Workmen's --
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Probably not.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
It usually is.
All these in the last year?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
I photographed it extensively, father.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Where do I charter a boat?
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Ann ... Ann!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Did you fear for your life?
Compassion.
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Sorry. 
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
What was better? I made better bait?
-- We can talk --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Gee.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
Not much point to this, is there?
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
-- Then you don't need me.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
No.
I was wondering what that was.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Go down in my room.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
How is it back there?
You were hired to look for Tom.
I've just got a few --
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
I think she's trying that.
Then how are you involved?
I know Tom Grunemann.
Are you closing the case?
The prospect of losing my child.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
No.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Yep.
Is that really your chair?
Like a principal?
And what is your present salary?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
And how did you find his work?
Yes.
No.
I don't recall.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
What?
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Kramer--
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Ted?  Are you there?
You ever see her talk to the walls?
No.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
What d'you tell her?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Ted, I just heard...
I worry about them.
Not the way to talk to people.
Can I do anything I want?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Yes.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
You could buy them.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
How big is Tibet's army?
What is the size of our army, now?
Did you ever doubt it?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I want to go down there.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
Am I running away?
You have grown up very good.
You, kill me?
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
You're crawling around like a--
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Is this a trick?
Was he a good man?
Right.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
Excuse me?
With crocodiles... everything's even.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Kelly Scott.
How big do the bears get?
Never been to Maine before?
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I didn't say it like that.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Ssssh!
Thing we can lift it?
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Calm down.
Are we crazy?
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
Hector!!
I'll take it!
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
What?
Should I?
The somebody else part?
Are you on drugs?
<u>Kelly</u>--
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Sometimes you do.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Your bleeding has stopped.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Ahhh... Why?
The death of my father.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
A cattle ranch?
Why so briefly?
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
I heard a strange sound...
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
What...?
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Yes, miss.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
What is it?
My letter...
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Some say that's the way of it.
One called Magua arrived.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
No.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
What happened to you?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yes.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
He did.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
And it killed Bo?
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
No fuckin' lie...
It needs blood?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Nope.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Son, have a look in his locker.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
The stupid bastards! Count it!
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
There is only three of us here.
And the weed?
Invitations?
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
What the hell are you doing here?
Right as rain.
I'11 meet you in the car.
I will.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Tom, you're all heart.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
What do you mean?
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
How do you think you're going to make a living?
And what did she do?
I'm sorry, sir.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Please.
So you knew this young man before?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
That badge--
You got a cause of death?
What's that for?
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
You've been in this house for a while?
The Trail of Tears.
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Maybe.
Mikey--
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Why would you want to do that?
Quien es? [Who is it?]
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
This girl has a child?
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Steve?
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
I was too busy.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
No--
What was your father's name?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You don't need to cuff me.
Just doing my job.
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Yeah. It's quiet--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
Sure.
You sell much out here?
No--
Payne.
Uh-huh.
I know that.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Who is he?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Right.
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
Please.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
I'm no bodyguard.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
And they all came...
Yes.
Valentin?
What about me?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
And this Butterfield guy--
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
I saw him in Vegas once.
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Yes.  It's regrettable
I can't let you in.
Yes.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Does anybody?
That.
For what?
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Oh Jeez.
Is that all?
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
This is where we killed him.
One question.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
Ok.
Oh.
Philosophy.
Hi again, how's it going?
Ok.
No one ever tells you that...
You made it.
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
I'm sorry.
Oh?
Do you like massage?
My stockings.
Hi, Lydia.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
What are you talking about?
I guess she's busy.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Hospital?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
I spaced out.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
My secretary?
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Nothing yet.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Good seeing you again.
Maya?  What do you mean?
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Are you saying he's legally sane?
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
That's not funny
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Sort of.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Nah.
You might be the only one with a job.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
I was just playing ball.
What's up, Sidra.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
So she's honest.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
You having fun?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
I can't be nice to a fan?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Yo, where's the "D"?
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
You don't think so?
Few days ago.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
A rest?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
So you're gonna bitch up?
So?
Nona, please.
Later when?
Guess he talked to you.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Sorry.
Lucky kid.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Good.
What kind of Cancer?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
Yes.
What?
No.
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
No.
About two years ago.
Bit messy.
I don't have a boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
What's that stand for?
This is my job.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
What is it?  Did you forget something?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
It's my favorite place --
Why not?
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
What?
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I lost my gun.
It's ok.
You live alone?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
It's ok --
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
Finish it up without the lip.
What's up?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
What is that?
Braces.
I've been a good worker --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
Where is he?
Get a girlfriend.
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Go fuck myself?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Who are you gonna call?
Is this 509-9027?
All it takes is one second?
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
So boring, so useless --
This isn't meant --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Not really.
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
She's my mother.
It's not your given name, right?
Are you asking me a question?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
How long...you think?
I'm really sorry.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
Ok. What's your name?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Yes.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
I don't think I want that.
Who?
Do you have any children with anyone?
Well maybe.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
Do you know the answer to this?
Did you ever touch her?
You're her boyfriend?
Can I come in?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
What does that mean?
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I have money.
I have money to give you.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
M'lady...?
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Louis, please -- !
Wh-- Wha--
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Who is he, Aramis?
And people close to him, who --
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Aramis, this will never --
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
We go someplace dangerous.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Thanks, but not for me.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
Who came?
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
At least help Raoul.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
... Two-thirty-seven.
The food doesn't please you?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Where are you?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Did you hit him?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Zydowski.  It's about time.
Where up north?
Mind if I turn out the light?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
No.  A witness.
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
Tubbs, it's me.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
Oh man...what happened?
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
It was you who did the asking.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Why?
Who is it?
You got the message Lecktor called...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
That's why the boltcutter.
Will...?
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
How far away's the back-up?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
I don't want to know.
Not me.
God, no.
You will tell the truth?
I want to see Lecktor now.
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
I don't understand.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
I don't think I'll tell you.
He's very strong physically.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
What happened to them?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
And you said?
Hello, hotshot!
Tell me about yourself.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Blue is cold.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Hello.
Come home with me.
That's not true.
Thanks for the lift.
Go on to the house.
Will it keep them out?
How did it happen?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You're insane.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Kevlar Second Chance.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
I refuse.
Those are my terms.
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
B-but... we saw... your neck...
What do you mean?
Hi...
Andy, the theater's that way!
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Each show is worse than the next.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
I saw Michael!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Bob Gorsky.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
That's the third white van I've seen.
Who is it?
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
... yes.
What are you doing?
How?
I got a fibrillation!
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
Why do my eyes hurt?
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
She would say she knows enough.
Yes.
That's why we're here.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
But what?
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
How did you do that?
What is this thing?
That's different.
What happened?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
I'm going in after him.
No, you... have to be.
I'm coming with you.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
It's a city?
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Cypher, I thought --
Tank, you're hurt.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Sounds good.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No, all we got is $40.
Yeah.
May God be with you.
Jewish...
Get out of here before this really goes up.
You flew before?
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
What's a'matter?
Where's the rest?
Stripper?
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Oh...around...why?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Anything specific?
No.
You're intolerable today.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
You mean it's heisted.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
Honey, please.
Paillarde of veal.
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
What are you eating.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Drew, you're out of line.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
I didn't say.
It doesn't matter.
May I interrupting?
Who are we talking about?
Did you just hear something?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
You're overthinking it --
Thanks, Quince.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Not time yet.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Yah.
She knows you real self?
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Confused, huh?  About what?
You love Allison, don't you?
You think so?  How do you know?
'Big'?
Come again?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
Yes --?
Then why are you here, Joe?
And I'll be a visitor.
Where are you going?
Don't.  That will come later.
I believe that, don't you?
No.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
And what?
Are you sad, Bill?
Are you going to eat your lunch
Why didn't you stop me?
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I don't know.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
I'm sorry, Bill --
'Spooning'?
This universe?
Uh --
Say again?
Which is what?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
No.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Of course.
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
How's that, Quince?
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Eddie?
Drew told me.
Uh oh --
So what's wrong with that?
Bravo.
Daddy, what's the matter?
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Nothing.
Are you relieved?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
When was I in here?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Is that what your little note says?
Yes.
Sleep okay?
What?
What are you gonna do?
Why would you do that?
What happened?
You tell me.
You're the memory guy?
Who's your boyfriend?
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Thank you.
It's good.
Who?
Why?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
So who are you saying he was?					*
Lemon or lime?
"And" what?
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
You need to consider a few issues.
I got to talk to my ADO...
So...?
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Like...?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Twenty-eight-point-five.
Why?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
I know.  And now?
What...?
Yeah.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Where the hell are you, man?
Verdado.
Havana, Cuba...?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
As in...?
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
From whom...?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
What are you talking about?
Control your men.
Yes.  What's up?
You mean with the flowers...?
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
And as an investment in the future...
Meaning...?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You sure you heard what I said?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
I ain't sleepy.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
They wrong?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Get outta my way.
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Years?
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Where'd you get that limp?
Not far. Just a little way.
Yes.  I think so.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
And?
Where is it?
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Whose?
Just got some news on Bell.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
There's some weird shit here.
What?
Look, I showed you my badge...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Great crowd.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Don't.
Your arm, you can't...
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
If you wouldn't mind.
Pretty rough so far.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
I can't write this anymore.
I'm telling you, I can't.
I said that?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Maybe.
I'm glad you like it.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Stop--stop right here.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
From her point of view or mine?
Where is it?
Not much luggage.
To do what?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
No.  Should I?
At least you walked.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
And that's the only reason?
Can you think of a better one?
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Much.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Where do I meet you?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Like?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
She sacrificed herself..
Yes, I gathered as much.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
I don't.  No exactly.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..not in time to save him.
..I'm fine..and you?
Come on!
To friends.
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Did we get it?
We got it.  On your feet.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
I'm walking.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Take off your coat.
Who is "they?"
Did they send you...Did they send you?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
Are you damaged?
Yes.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Certainly Ethan.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Whats going to make him do that?
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Yes...  Its him.
Whats the problem.
No, I'm going.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Thank you, Rose.
Bed.
You look tired.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Maybe.
He did?
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Why didn't he call himself?
That's it.
How many men since then?
Your blood.
Loretta.
What? What have we done?
I know what I know.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Will you marry me?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
This is a good suit.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
WHAT?
I'm thirty-seven years old.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
I know.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
So.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Maybe I should go?
That's incredible.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Nerves.
You knew that man?
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
What? What?
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
You got me.
I see.  Yes, of course.
Where did you get the coconuts?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
We don't have a lord.
NI!   NI!
We want ... a shrubbery!
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
What word?
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
Nu!
What?
Je...sus Christ!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Yes, Lord.
... Well, we did do the nose.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is the capital of Assyria?
Thanks very much.
Well taken, Concorde!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Farewell, Concorde!
They cost fifty pounds each!
What - the curtains?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Oh!
They're all saying the word ...
So?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Mr Brown, sir --
I see.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Her Highness' Equerry.
Why do you think I keep her here?
Too busy looking after themselves.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Then they may read about me.
Who?
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
What do they want?
Why is he not here?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
How the hell did you do that?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Sick?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
Where to now?
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
You're not coming, Alex.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
One.  In case...
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
What is it?
You have no time.  What is your question?
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
What did you say?
They fired everyone.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Someone's shut off my money!
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
No, I don't.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Betty.
You're still here?
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Yes, there was.
But it said #12.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
What is it Rita?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
You don't remember anything else?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Good luck!
Rita... I know what you're doing.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Yes, Sir.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Yeah, what for?
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Not a coke or anything?
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
What's going on ?
How do we get out of this room ?
So where does this lead ?
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
I... I .....
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Where ?
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Not yet.
When will that be ?
You did.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Well ?
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
John, sir.
Zachary.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
Will he make it out ?
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Yes.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Good morning.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
This is California, anything is possible.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
Hi honey.
Yeah.
I will. How's Shelly?
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
How about a nice glass of milk?
No.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
More than anything in the world.
Come on in!
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
But we made a business deal.
Yeah, RIGHT.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Boyfriend?
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
An adventure?
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
They're great.
You want me to come with?
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
He was caressing.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
Well maybe for you.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Is there milk in them already?
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Really?
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Yes they are.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Uh huh?
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Are you mad at me?
What are you wearing?
Yes.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Dad?
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Are they ready yet?
Why not?
I'm very nervous.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Will you tell her I came by?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Who's that?
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Big Ringo fan.
Are you married?
Can I use your bathroom first?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
No.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
It'll bleed.
What?
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
You better not either.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Needs salt.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Kindred spirits.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Excuse me?
But I can't be dry.
What else did he tell you...
Let me rephrase that...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
About Michael's job.
But he always says...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
So... one almost has to...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Please come, please.
Hate that.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
You miss her, huh?
Where did we first hear th...
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
Well.  How come she didn't...
Lower.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
You have to what?
She's going to rest now.
She's fine.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Third party?
What does he want?
You want anything?  A drink?
Where are you going?
Hey!
Hi, Sherry.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
You want me to wait?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
How do you know?
No.
Parts.
Do you carry door handles?
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Yes, it is --
How long have you been with them?
Do you ever do any writing?
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
I'm here.
I'd really like to see you.
Wow!
Oh.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Stay.
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
For him?
What for?
Sleeping.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hi.
You do?
I know a couple.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
You sure do it loud.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Divine intervention.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
She was born without a tongue.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Says who?
Where's it parked?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Only on a much grander scale.
Yes.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Waitin' in the lounge.
When do you want the assembly?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Two guys?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Give her a beer.
It sure is.
Boy - you hear me?!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
No. You got the wrong idea.
What d'you think?
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
I'll smile when it's funny.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
She done moved to Detroit.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Name's Duff.
Thanks.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
I'm a teacher.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Hell!
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
I wouldn't have let you.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
That's the way he is.
What d'you mean?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Just for the day?
I didn't know you had one.
Four.
What?
How about it?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
What about him?
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Hi.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
How come you don't hate their guts?
There's nothing to say.
Where're you going to go?
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
It's for your own good.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
What's this?
What about McCoy?
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
Can you read my mind?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Jah guides us.
Never heard of him.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Less than thirty minutes.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Maybe something's onto him.
Won't that mean you're dead?
You okay?
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
What?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Yeah.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
That's your story!
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Rufus?
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
You like her?
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
I know.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Our penguin, right?
Do you think you'll find her?
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
That is so sad --
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
He <u>has</u> to know...
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
He's conducting experiments of his own.
You got your room straightened out yet?
I'll kill you now.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
It was okay.
Are you nuts or something?
You're fucked in the head.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
You okay?
What's all this.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
What's so funny?
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Mom?
They're healing up nicely.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
Do you still...see each other?
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Max, where's Kristen?
It's over.  It's over.
Tell me about the kids.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Never been here before?
Sounds like a rough time.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
Remember -- open mind.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
What was that?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
Hi.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Here we go.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Too complicated.
She left me.
I'm sorry.
You've got to go.
Eleven.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
You like Chagall?
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Oh please sod off.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
How are you doing?
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Hi.
I thought I'd give it to you.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Yes...
What's your name?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Miracles do happen.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Hello, Bernie.
Me?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Blimey.  What's that?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
No, it doesn't.
Any more announcements?
I believe I have.
No, sir.
No, sir.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
What are the choices?
Cool, huh?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
What did she say?
Try 'Flintstone.'
What?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Spike!
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Yes, ma'am?
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
God Bless America.
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
A pecking party?
Did to me?
No!
Hear what?
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Who is he?
Yes, I see it! I see it!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
What happened?
That!
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
You ol' fucker!
So, what's the story with your friend?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
We found each other, didn't we?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
What's mezzaluna?
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Hi, Peter.
And she's a knock-out, too.
How about music?  You like classical?
I'm sorry.
Yes.  I am.
Tonight?
Really?
No.  He smokes.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
So, what's your point?
Is he married?
So?...
Why don't you ask him?
It's a coincidence.
Because you were afraid to fly.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
What'd you find?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
What's that supposed to mean?...
'Course he does.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Sure you did.
Oh my God.  Where?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Joan Collins stayed here.
He's a jerk.
Yes.  He is.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Yeah--
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Thanks.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Mmhmmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Wow... .
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Terry...?
You know how the Sisters are.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.
The things that go on.
Terry!
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
What I did to Joey.
What I did to Joey.
Charley.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
What about it?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Hit me again.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
You got some nerve.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Keep Charley out of this.
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Then..then what's that music?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Nothing is worth your life.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
Ahh, there is yet time.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Yes, Master.
You know better than that.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Glenn Michaels.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Jack?
Outside of that.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
Just hung up.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
You know how I felt about her.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
In the trunk, yeah?
Shut up.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
Yeah, why?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Leave it where it is.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
The fuck you talking about?
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
So you've done this before, huh?
Boy, it stunk in there.
Of course I am.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
You like bourbon?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
Where?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
Of course not.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
Glenn, take the exit.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
I'm freezing my ass off.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Here?  In this house?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Thanks, Dad.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
I really gotta go.
You were talking in your sleep.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Thank you...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Ten gees.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Do you always stutter?
Nervous?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You're Walker, right?
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Hale-what?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Yeah.
Waitress!  Four beers!
Get me into a plane!
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Our doctor's gone too.
Sorry to trouble you.
Boxin'.
You take care, Dorie.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
Rafe --
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Have the planes made it to China?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Fook ya!
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Just what you underlined.
Charlie really has a great voice.
That's disgusting!
I know. Put Scott through college.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Yeah. Like that.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Charlie, let's make love.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
You think so?
What?
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh, you're both so naive.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Okay. I promise.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Did you break up with Charlie?
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Is something wrong?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
All set?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
How long have you been here?
Bob...
What's wrong with your face?
Why are you getting dressed?
I'm not going to close the--
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Take it easy, Walter.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Nine.
Rayisha.
There is no relevant precedent.
Uh huh...
What have you prayed for?
Opera?
Particularly, Charles.
What do you love about it?
Rach.
Something like that.
Do you need a break?
In some situations.
Absolutely.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Who?
That's perfectly clear.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
So why isn't it all bloody?
Little ratty-ass.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
He can pilot?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
How much you weigh, Johns?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
You mean that "load" of passengers?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Frightening thought.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
You still don't believe me, do you?
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
What's so special about him?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
'Then how do you account for me?,
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
It's no use ... there she goes.
No cigar.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Shhhh!
What is this?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
It's humiliating.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Do you believe him?
But there's the doll, sir.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
I got one...
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
But what'd she actually do?
I'll go with you.
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
You volunteered for this shit man?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Found it. Growing in a garden.
I didn't like it.
You don't want to hear about it?
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Thank you.
Yes?
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
Good evening, Miss.
Immigration Officer?
They might think I was running away from something.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
He got in here how?
He was a great boy for that. What else?
They know you here--know your name.
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Me?
Yes, Miss.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
You understand perfectly.
Very ridiculous.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
To do what?
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
You asked for it.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
Where?
I wouldn't know.
That must hurt.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
Floater?
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.
Pretty big chance, huh?
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
How about Magruder?
So far.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Nice.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Yes.
Thank you.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
How's Mary?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Hello.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I haven't really thought about it.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
Oh yes.
Ha ha...
That's enough of that.
Hello.
Thanks.
Suez.  1956.
Hello, Jimmy.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Friends of yours, huh?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
One shot stopping.
What's this?
Where's Roach?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Three seconds... two... one...
Yeah?  What?
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Look at you.
So what'd the other guy look like?
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Who's our back-up on this?
Why us?
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Any sign of the hostages?
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
We can reach an understanding on this.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Storage, I think.
Who are you going after next, sir?
How are you, Mr. Kross.
What's that?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
The price just went up to ten.
New York.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
For an hour.
Fine.
Off the boulevard.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
I buy companies.
By breaking up a company's assets --
What?
I got a dress, yeah.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
But don't they have it in English?
It was good.
We're letting them slide?
But, Edward...
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Why do you want to know?
Did I wake you?
Give me twenty minutes.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Yeah.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
It was great.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
And who is that?
They will serve salad.
Excuse me?
What?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
... as ... you ... wish...
I fear I'll never see you again.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
We'll never survive.
We did it.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I thought I was going faster.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
He's really very short on charm.
The body?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
I brought you a special present.
A book?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
What? What?
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Shall we track them both?
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Now?
I thought he was with you.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Sixty-five.
Slow going?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I accept.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
Yeah, an hour.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
What was I saying?
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What scheme?
I'm not going to jump on you!
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
It won't run a week!
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
No way out.  No way out.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Finder's keepers.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
The Graf Spee...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
You out to buy a motel?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Very early. Dawn.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Yes.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
With you.
Where?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
She haven't even called you?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
It's been three.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Where'd you go to college?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
For what?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
A man should have a hobby.
Is your time so empty?
You go out... with friends?
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
You should... mind it.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Very early. Dawn.
Frankly, yes.
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Arbogast.
I'll get your bags.
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
No mother.
Did you wish to see someone?
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
That's it. You get it quick.
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
You're losing your blood?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
Did you? Where?
I don't agree with you.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
You did miss --
Excuse me???
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Is Rose here?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Here comes Daddy.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Five hundred rabbits?
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Of course not!
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
I think Daddy suspects.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Then why does she act so dumb?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
That's what she would say herself.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Well, she's back.
Is she all right?
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
It's twenty after one.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Mine.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Yes, dear, what is it?
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
You can stop it right now.
Oh, no, ma'am.
More history, Rose.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
You're not gonna see him again.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
What and?  That's what I got.
Now you know what to watch for...
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Jiminy Christmas.
That's them trying to kill us.
Where we going?
Birth control's important.
That's him alright.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Follow me.
You live like a pig.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
He tried to kill us.
Our resignations.
You can't be serious.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Any preferences?
You suck at lying, Archie.
We're screwed.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Someone who loves you.
What's going on?
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Quiet.
Tell me.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
I was telling the truth.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
I've got something to say.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Goodbye
Was all I had to say
Are you - giving a party?
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
You sure?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
I don't think I belong here.
...What?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Don't want weak legs.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
He won't last one round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
How was the flight, Champ?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Few minutes?
Here -- Three minutes.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Yeah.
Gonna try.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
More like thirty.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Yeah, Kayo.
...No.
Here's the card?
What's happened is freak luck.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
I got pain an' experience too.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
What?
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Why?
It don't bother me none.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Outta my house I want ya!!
...I can't haul meat no more.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Shoulda guessed.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Maroon, right?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
They?
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
What the hell's a freeway?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
No...
How did you get onto Doom?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
So what do you want me to do?
I got him on loan from Disney.
Aah!
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
A Toon?  Noooo.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
I'll not endure him.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Goodnight.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
What?
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
I will follow you.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
This is important.
Do you really think so?
We kept it...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
Not to me, you know that.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
You were a soldier, were you?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Is that right?
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Eat shit and die slowly...
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Sorry I'm late...
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
I needed to know.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
They don't have the package.
What the fuck happened?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
So I do it.
In a minute.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
You put everything on the line because you...
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
At the expense of six people.
What are you gonna do?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
You're crazy.
He killed her...he killed her...
It's too late...
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
I'm all ears.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
OK.
And I'd take it out on him.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I don't know, Booth.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
And what's that?
I guess we can get started.
Don't you have to be here?
Dwayne.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
What's this?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
You'd do this to me?!
I was in the neighborhood.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Winner six!
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
What?
That's right.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Well, hurry up.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
You.
Who?
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
How do you know he's our man?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
You sound like that all the time.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
It's a long story.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Slow down, baby.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
Fine with me.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Vegas...
What is Mac out?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
Just trying to make it look real.
Are you okay?
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
I know, Master, but...
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
A little.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Where were we?
The license!  You get it?!
No.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
What?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
You know War?
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Like that.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
She's fine.
Hello.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Yes.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
Of course.
It's hurting.
"Make the shot."
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
What?
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
Seven-fifty.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Yes.
It's fun!  It's high.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
About a minute...?
So am I.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Yes, I did.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Lighten up, wahine.
No, I'm just going to head home.
No, you tell her.
-- who's married to --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Nope.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
You go.
About forever.
So what happened?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
You're a basket case.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
Can too.
I know.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
It's a sign --
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
No, I know that part --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
What?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
How amazing.
It's me?
Have you had any relationship since?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
And you're worried about him.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
What's tira misu?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
What is it?
It plays in 50 states.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
What?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
English muffin.  How do you do it?
It was sinking.
Bye bye blackbird.
I don't know.
I'm starting to forget her.
Great.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Do you like it?
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
You look good.
You did?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
You mean Delaware?
You've got to help around the house!
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
What attitude?
Did you see his hair color?
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Oh God.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Then leave.
I can't.
It gets me through the day.
What's wrong, Danny?
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
Where to?
Nice day
Sorry.
What the hell is that?
Make me an offer.
You want to do this some other time?
Come on, guys ...
What the hell is this?
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Danny, I'm touched.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Jesus.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
He's the only one I told.
That would be me.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
You're lucky, Flynne.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
Tom, let's spend the night here.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
That must be four thousand yards.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
Y'all come back.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Say what, Cap'n?
You know classical music?
Over three-hundred.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Sure, you got one?
Goddamn it, sir...
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Three for three.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
I don't like that one.
Maybe Caen.
HERE THEY COME!
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
Goddamn it!
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
How fast?
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Hey, sis.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Yeah.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
That's just so embarrassing.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Yes.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
They really applauded you today honey.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
You will?
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Are you busy on Friday?
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
No, I'm serious.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
You think so?
Stop by later.
Okay, bye, I will.
Be friends?
I don't think so.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
No, no.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Yeah.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
She's very successful.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Just her name.
My car.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Oh boy.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
Look -
You asked for shoe polish.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
Don't ever do that to me again.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
I got to go, I'll see you.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
That's very generous of you.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
Would it do any good?
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
What if I said goodbye?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
Did it?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Where's Sid?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
I never meant to imply...
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
This is all too familiar.
Just in case...
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
What?
I have rehearsal.
I got a surprise for you.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
I hate scary movies.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Nope.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Four? There are five.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
What do you mean?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Is that a threat, Detective?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Why would the police come to you?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Who's phone?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
She can't get both of us.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Uh-huh.
You don't still think it was me?
I thought you were...
Yes.
Hello.
You're making popcorn?
Really? What?
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why do you want to know my name?
What did you say?
What do you want?
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
So you better leave.
No...
Please don't do this...
...please...
No it's not. It was Jason.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Afraid not.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Where is she?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Please. You owe me.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Stu was with me last night.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
I thought everything was checked out.
Why are they doing this?
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Take a message.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
What am I? The beer wench?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Have you heard?
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
It's always been like this.
What?  What?
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Spit it out.
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
What the fuck is going on?
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
I... I don't follow.
You just met me.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Not here.
No one yet.
No.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Does this make it with you?
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
So they ran our list.
Are you alright?
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
You stupid son of a...
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
What is it?
Don't do this... please...
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
No sir...pleasure.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
I didn't give any order to fire!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Oh...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
No...She's not...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
It wasn't much of a letter...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
I got to fetch her home...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
I have to cut his windpipe...
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
For God's sake, what happened to me?
Ellen.
Ellen Straub.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Mrs. Straub!
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Yes, I saw it.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Is it going well?
Who is she this time?!
Fifty pounds? What for?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Good title.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
As a nurse.
Your mother, and your father
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Master Shakespeare
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Better fortune, boy.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Who is there?
Oh but why "alas?"
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh--no, no!
Oh, Will!
That's my line!
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Take off your hat.
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
She sings too?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
"Poet?"
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
Have you seen him?
No.
Don't you worry about that.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
What's all this for, more security?
But they know.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
That's it, then.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
For the flat.
The man we know and love.
Know and love?
I don't thinkI can.
No.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
We have to talk.
We could put it somewhere.
What?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
Don't you ever stop?
You were going to say something.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
It's about the burglary.
Yes, absolutely.
No.
I thought you'd gone to work.
Sorry?
But they sneer, don't they?
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?
It's nice.
It was some guy called Brian.
Sorry?
Offering it for debate.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
-- is that what this is all about?
What?
I don't know.
Gee, that's very serious...
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
Is she all right?
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No.
I guess so.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Chopped liver?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Am I what?
No shit.
No.
I am not like my mother!
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Great.
What's wrong?
Not too much, don't cut too much.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George... how about Felicia?
You know what I'm talking about.
Baby...
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- you are.
-- ass and legs --
-- Jesus --
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What for?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
-- Oh yeah.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Jackie Shawn.
I just... who what?
Keep moving --
Fine. How are you?
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
You're great.
Will we live together?
George.
Yeah, baby...
Go where?
What?
Bullshit.
What is.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
-- please, baby --
George...
Please!... that's not like you.
No.
In a way. But...
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
... this doing hair it's...
You live like a pig.
What do they look like?...
Why, why do you think that is?
No thanks.
She's nothing but a whore.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
No you won't.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
I'd like a drink.
No.
-- you phony asshole --
Who is that?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- Yeah, honey...
I would say so, yes.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
What did you do?
Egypt?
Oh. thank you.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
What's wrong?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Call me Les.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
No, Dad.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Chocolate.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Yes.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Okay, Mom.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Red Rum.
Why not?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Pleased to meet you.
Perfect for a child.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
Did you find anything?
Get him out of here?
Yes.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Not for me.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
The moon's not down yet...
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
I've been hearing noises in there.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Yeah... sure.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
There! You see!
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
Oh my! 
HE'S SO FINE.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Soprano or alto?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
What?
I don't want to mess anyone up...
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
A what?
My what?
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Really catching on.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
A vote?
I must go where I can be of use.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Like what?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
But you didn't tell me!
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Is this like your old convent?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
She's... she's a nun.
No bleeding.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
They need guidance.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Not for lack of trying.
Listen to what you say....
Are you familiar with magnets?
It's spectacular.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
I hear nothing.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
What is it?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Lady Van Tassel...
What can we do?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
If you want.  But...
It was not butchery.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
It is only me.
What is so urgent?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Katrina...
Where are we going?
Ichabod...
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
He rides tonight.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Well, I guess it's all good.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Yeah.
You know what, by God?
Please Doyle, don't.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
What's you last name?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Were they bad people?
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
All right then.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
What you readin'?
No sir.
Yeah, I guess.
I've got a feelin' today.
I know he does.
You better go get your things.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Yes sir.
Right now?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
I've heard it said that way.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
What about me?
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Where will he go?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
It's my birthday.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Not an easy book.
Jesus, what happened to you?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Hey, man, good to see you.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
So. Are we ready?
Yeah, probably.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Where to?
Yeah, like what?
Still, you can't just write her off.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
I almost got married once.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
And why the hell would you give me money?
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
Huh?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
And these?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
You mean Rashid?
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Yeah, I can believe it.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Drawing's a good thing.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
That's when he fell.
Maybe...?
And what's that?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
Well...
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Bye.
Beat it, Buster.
Funny?  In what way?
Thank you ever so.
A what?
Okay. 
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
No we're not.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Hey, Joe!
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
And I'm not even pretty.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
You - you -
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
That's right.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Sugar?
Oh - Sugar!
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
I guess she's not in here.
No!
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Daphne...
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Why not?
It doesn't matter.
We won't breathe a word.
No - funerals.
Tell what?
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
You can't trust those guys.
That so?
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Why not?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Oh?
Would you mind moving along, please?
What?
One of whom?
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
What a beautiful fish.
What's on Thursdays?
Harmless - how?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Did you have a nice time?
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
I cut myself shaving.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Except its Scotch.
I should get going.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Huh?
Ill just check into a hotel.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Nothing, nothing.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
I dont know.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
Hey, Sal.
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
You don't live around here, do you?
That does it...
What's his name?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
Yes, mam...
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Well, looka here...
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Where's everybody?
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Sunday...
Miss Boatwright --
Yes, David...
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Can't sleep?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Whatcha got there?
How's the weather out there?
Where you goin'!?
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
What...
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Why the fuck not?
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
To free Terrance and Phillip.
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
What?
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Viva la Resistance.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mrph?
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
MOM!!!
That's gonna take a long time!
Dude, we don't have watches.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
It's so very cold...
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Does it say what the clitoris is?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Thank you, Kenny.
I'm needing lunch.
I am the dark master!
The F word?!
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
We must take action on this immediately.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
What's going on Terrance?
NAZIS!!
You don't have watches?
I think we're moving.
Oh yeah...
Well I appreciate that.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
It's time we lock coordinates.
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Like open an airlock by mistake?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
OK...it's open.
Dawn!  Dawn!
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
What kind of man?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
- canker sore.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
It depends.
You shouldn't touch her.
Junior who?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Now swing it out a little to the right...
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Where can I find him?
Business.
Won't your father help you with that?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Do I want you?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
So why do you stay?
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Why not?
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
What about plan C?
Sez you!
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
I'm not here to bowl.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Open it, Captain!
Back away then.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
But you've tested it?
Increase positive pressure!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It doesn't make any sense.
You don't want to know.
You think he killed Edmunds?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
It's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
What?
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
She's not gonna know.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
We had considered it.
To what?
Yeah, why?
In Edmunds' things.
What?
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Four days?
You don't trust me?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
What's the matter?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
None of this was here before.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Page 87.
What?
You think, in the sphere --
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Someone did.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Beth!
C'mon --
Get away from me!
Well, what's your theory?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
What happened to her?
Wisconsin?
Missed.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
What does Norman already know?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
What report?
He wasn't feeling well.
You mean a picture?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Please, Ted.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
I'll get the information.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
Are you sure you don't need it?
The Kiber Crystal.
Of course, where you been kid?
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
Where are you taking us now anyway?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Why didn't you say so before.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
See Threepio... do you copy?
I read you sir.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
They revoke our flight status.
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
So ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Eeuch !
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
You talk to Carl ?
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Report.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
What ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
Way to go, amigo !
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
All bands.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
On whose authority, Corporal ?
Can you walk ?
Not a problem.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Hit your jets, sir !
The examination is a normal function.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
They have repressed the Creator.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Then you acted properly, of course.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
Hello, Ilia.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Mr. Spock?
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
One hundred kilometers...
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
And whatever you sensed out here....
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
I want to rent this one.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
Goodbye.
...such a pleasant sound.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
I thought you had Play Practice.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
What happened?
Paperclip?
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
...yes.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
But that's what happened.
What are you going to do?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Hi!
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Wat...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
How big is this horse?
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
What'll I do for fun?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
What else?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
She's a...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
You do...?
You guys had better leave us a...
I'm very sorry to...
What's his name?
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
She's absolutely r...
Oh.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
...we had a script conference...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
Yes.
An artist of your caliber...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Where you off to?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Hi.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I know the feeling.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
<u>Siddown</u>!
I...
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
No.
What did you say to them...?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
We got the permit.
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
She coulda done better than him.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
We have to lose the window.
Why?
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I don't care.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Like who?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
I'm gonna call him.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Actually.  I could only help him.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
She still packing for her trip?
That's so weak.
Mommy?
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
But you can still see him.
It's not good enough.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
That's necessary, huh?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
Easy enough.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
What happens next?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
But it's not on the schedule!
Yeh?
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
You feeling all right?
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
And her...?
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Is that what he told you?
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Ben never mentioned it.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Rache, it may take time.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
I'm still poor.
Who is Jesus?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
How did they execute him?
But really, you never know.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Nothing, I guess
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
What's an audience going to tell you?
What?
It's all about who you know.
You mean, again?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
One in a million recover.
Thanks.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Hello, Vi.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Uh huh.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Any books you like to read for fun?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
You know...I like you.
I'll lead.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What do you think?
You're going to pay for this...
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Come on, drink up.
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Get your men to do it!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Does the threat board show anything?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Yes, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
Why do you think I ask?
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
Suppose that were the case?
I know that, sir.
That about right?
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
What the hell is Plan-R?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Then this is it.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Roger.
Everything still checks out okay.
Can't "Ace" help you?
What happened?
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
But who would be chosen?
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
Yeah.
In Group?
Slides go with it.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Now?
And your mom.
It's your birthday?
Sorry.
That sounds so depressing.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
What, they're looking for her?
No. It didn't, Buff.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Yeah.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Yes! Free concert!
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
You better! Yes!
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
You could do it.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Come on. Inside.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
He is.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
I'd love to read that.
Hi.
Two-fifty.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Just go home, alright?
Why we're just standing here.
Nazeer what?
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Like what?
Yes, you do.
Where are you going?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I'm moving.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Tim?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Your manager?
Could you give me a ride?
... I don't know.  Probably not.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Or, I could get my own horse...
All of you!
That was the general idea.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Hurt feelings department.
I've been hoping to run into you.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Thank you.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
You sure have.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Second generation, huh?
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Hello, Betty.
If you love me, Joe.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Just a minute, you!
You're a writer, you said.
Are you or aren't you?
I wrote that with my heart.
I don't know.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Keep it.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
How did it go?
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Yes, I am, Norma.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
Madame is waiting.
Uh-huh?
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you want?
I have to.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Why not ?
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
No.
Away. From you.
I'm not mad at you.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Hmmm?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
I don't want your help.
You vicious--
Yes.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
That was meant for me!
You look at them? How?
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
I didn't --
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Well...  Not quite like this.
What are you doing?
A television set?
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
I know, I'm the fault.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Stone mutha.
Can you do that?
You want to mess with Superman?
Watch out for them air pockets!
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Turn on the light.
Okay? Goodbye.
Where's the handle?
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Small potatoes.
We already have a super-tanker.
Lois, I usually do.
It is kinda romantic.
Lois, you're amazing.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Sleep well?
I'm sorry.
Everything on it?
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
A parka.
This way Lex.
I'll be alright.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
General --- ?
You're late. Very late.
What about here?
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Well, I don't understand.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
An angle?
Who?
You think he'll find us.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
You are . . .
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Albert!
Your bookie?
Actually, she's silver-haired.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
You're not the only one.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Shut up.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
No news is not good news. Y'know
Then -
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
No! You couldn't imagine -
Twenty-four.
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
How old are you?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Sure.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
On radio waves?
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
Say hi to Zoe.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Why are you telling me this?
I'll be back around nine.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
What are you thinking?
Good night, Billy.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
And they loved Bear.
Berry-picking.
And what's that?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
Yes.  He does.
You've talked to Billy?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
I didn't say that.
We've only got honey.
What happened to summer?
Did he say what about?
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
What's a ditty again?
That's right.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
I won't lie.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
Dolores.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
I have no questions.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Need a hand?
How old is she?
Almost three.
I'm in a car wash.
So what's the problem?
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
No.
Are you a reporter?
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Yes.
There wasn't time?
That was great.
You mean it?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Is "he" inside?
Did she accept?
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
He means that much to you...?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
What does that mean - integrity?
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Could this be that boy?
Bribing me again?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
You haven't told him yet...
I made you write a beautiful song...
Steve, I...
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
I can't
Do you know about the chip?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Why?
Everything.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Alriight!!  My man!
No!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
John, get out of the way!!
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
I have detailed files.
Respect your elders and your betters!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Where you from, David?
Yes.
You bet.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
Colonel. Pleasure.
Not yet.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
You live here, in Berlin?
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
What is this, Emmi?
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I made no deal!
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
How?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
Then you are wrong.
Yes, I know who he is.
And what did he say?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I don't understand what you mean.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Of course I know what that is.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Yeah?
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Never heard of him, who is he?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
You must have a girlfriend.
There's so much...
It's okay.  Forget it.
Molecular-memory.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Let's go.  Time to move out.
What's that?
Don't say that.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I can't sleep.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You don't talk to me like that.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
Don't even think about it.
If there was one.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
A fresh shirt...
What are you doing here?
What is it?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
What did you say?
Scams, con games.  How many?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Stop it!
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Boyfriend?
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
Happy Birthday, man.
You look good.
Call that number.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Tell me you'll call.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
What have they been doing to you?
It's them.  They did this.
The phone's dead.
Do you know how to change a tire?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
You don't need me...
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Your ex-wife.
Attractive...
You're joking.
He hasn't called back.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Sure.
And those are Luke's and mine.
Nell --
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
What happened after you smelled it?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
Someone is playing with you.
I don't know.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Oh God, we can't get out!
What do you want?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
What did it cost?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Theo... Did you?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
Why?
We think?
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Huh?
I didn't expect anyone.
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
This ain't your lot?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Uh-huh.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
You look alike.
Sort a few things out.
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Ashamed.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
I might've been away for the weekend.
He give me your address.
Nah, accommodation address.
That's what was estimated.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Right.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
Tell us about it.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Just now?  Overnight?
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Where is he now?
Ian?
You sure?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
I don't know.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
You do?
Like what.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Walked.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Who's looking for you?
Tell you ...
Hi, Mr Crane.
We've certainly missed you.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
But more or less.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
You got the dough?!
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
I'll have it in a week.
Way out of line.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
Mm.
Uh-huh.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Will anyone else say they knew?
So... who... who actually--
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
...Ed?
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
...You ever wonder about it?
...How you today, Ed?
Huh?
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
...You're Ed Crane?
Where's the walk-in safe?
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
It's still back there!
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Curious.  There's something missing.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
Like the claw.
What's that?
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Yes.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
They've got something.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
I don't understand.
You loved him.
How did you know that?
Wounded?
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
Hide quickly!
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
What?
I have to shoot.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Fiji.</i>
Why is he in the basement?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
We're not watching the sea.
Cue music...
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
Amnesia.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
A window onto the human condition?
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
How can they have a child?
Why not?
Well, what do you want to do?
What're we doing here, Truman?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
I know.
Good night, Mother.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, that was our house!
How's your hip?
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
Who?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Yup.
What do you do?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Do I know you?
I know the name. Why?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
What killed those men?
I'll know soon enough.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
Where are you, Scully?
No. I haven't.
I think they have that covered.
Scully...
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
What are you implying, Scully?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
You said you weren't coming?
And where are they going with it?
You hear that?
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
On whose orders?
Are we being watched?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
What do you mean, walked?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
How?
What alien environment?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Don't bring it home in this.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I realize that...
What about Julia?
You're sure of that?
Into Stargher.  Inside...
No.
I need it.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
You were awfully good.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
When...what did you do?
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
We're both in it, Harry.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
...again.
How do you know?
They're Harry's.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
When did you see him last?
Ever seen one?
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Do you see what that means?
I said you win.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
No, a major, were you really?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
I want to talk to you.
And - Anna...
Coffee.
Are you mad?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime - yes.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
Funny?
He didn't want to get involved.
...this time.
Passport, please.
Okay.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
We're ok.
Francoise -
Too far?
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
They only kill them when they love them?
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Oh, please...
What do you care?
Why the fuck not?
I don't care about money.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Your father??
And belief follows?
Why should I submit?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
I agree.
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Female...
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
How did you...?
It was a nine millimeter.
Daniel Balint.
What kids?...
Shut up. Fuck you....
Why? Why would she?
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
Adam Sandler.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
They're not that Jewish.
Do you think I...
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
What about the shoes?
The rules are the rules.
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
Why?
You're the best, Enzo!
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
No, no!
Not at all!
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
What is it?
Anybody can have a bad day!
But what brought you to Sicily?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Why?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
Promise me one thing.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
... And the new stereo.
It's his heartbeat.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
No.  I'm just depressed.
What are they for?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
I'll go see how he's doing.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Want to get a drink?
What!?
What are you doing here?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
What's wrong with him?
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Good looking?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I sleep it off.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
Sure!
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
He will be waiting...
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Good evening.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
You know Charlie How-Come?
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so 
You're too good to me.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
We stood here once before.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around 4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Are you all right?
Sorry?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
Youre mad...
Have you finished?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Leon hung himself...
...You-you spoke to him?
Something like that?
Should I?
You seem to know what youre talking about.
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
Get to the point, will you...
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
Hah... What about Nathalie?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Hi...
Why?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
No... No...  I swear...
Yeah... The Diplomat.
And who does Friedman work for?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
So you havent seen the film, then?
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
May I...?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
Er... Yes...
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Now?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Yes...
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
But that was her order!
Didn't you also carry a banner?
To avoid killing anyone.
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
We want her burned as a witch!
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
What about you?
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
You did well...
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
What difference does it make where she comes from?
His face.
I know...
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
The wind will be against us...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
No...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
My... visions...
What signs?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
I need to confess.
Then... why are you here so often?
Him?
Beautiful.
I'm going to get a doctor.
Dorota!
He'll be back before curfew.
And how's Yurek?
I've no money.
What's this about?
A good place for what?  He's insane!
I can look after myself!
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Dirty pig!
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
I am... I was a pianist.
Where are you hiding?
In the attic.
What's all that gunfire?
To be deaf?
There is something to be said for silence
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Which mountains are those dear?
She looks tired.
Yes, why not.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
We can't leave the piano
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
You got a bag or somethin?
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I picked something up on the way.
You know anything about him?
I'll take him anyway.
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Looks like he's sulking.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
See and raise 1,000.
I'll square it with the fixer.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
What time you get off work here?
No.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
He'll never do it.
Cheer up, darling.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
You've got to get your mind off this.
Don't.  It's horrible.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Another Martini --
Yes.
How did you ever remember me?
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
It's a promise?
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
I never saw him before.
You've been there?
No.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
I see.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
But he's interested!
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
Dorothy!  Is she here?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
I'm going to tell her.
Mimi...
I wish you'd tell me who.
Maybe she has.
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Where'd they go?
What am I supposed to do?
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
What are you doing?
Knock it off!
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Oh, that's fun.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Just relax.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
You're not losing trust, are you?
They're doing more than slapping.
If they land--
A whole lot of nothing.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
We'll find our way.
We can't just leave him.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
What did you say?
And then shoot them.
To where?
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know!
...Wes...?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
What is this?
Now you need me.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
It doesn't mean anything.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Yeah!  Yeah!
Yeah, well, we're not.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
I've never been under the table before.
Look,dirt!
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
Don't take anything.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
What?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Where is LUH?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
You're in violation.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
What?
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
Where did you get this?
Now wait just a fucking-
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
So cut both.
Which one's which?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
What's up?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Right.
It's from an IRA.
You got it.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Alright!
Drop it.
What the hell was that?
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Look who's talking, old man.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Goddamit, Reilly--
What's this?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
Nice suit.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I don't want to see you at all!
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
What is it?
What do you mean?
Good day, Doctor.
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Please.
Thank you.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
By the way, how is your German?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
But, Lily--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Oh!
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Madame.
Yes, I would!
Any minute I want!
Thirty-three--
Goodbye.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Yes, madame!
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Two lumps, madame?
For all the really important things--
I beg your pardon!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Holy shit.
What?
Rose Calvert.
An accident?!
My God... Cal. Is it a --
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Is this in any way unclear?
Sure. Count me in.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
You're crazy.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
If only it were that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
It's so cold.
April 14, 1912.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
It's been 84 years...
Just tell us what you can --
It's so unfair.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
I hope so.
No gentleman would do that.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
I'm so sorry!
Yes--are you?
I could stand some more--
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.
Good-by!
Married?
When?
What, again?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Who with?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Come in! 
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Here's your fifty.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Well, did you find me?
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
McKinney's the name.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
What's the matter?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Shut up, Ike.
I'm retired.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Credat Judaeus Apella.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Since when is faro a business?
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
What's wrong?
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
That what you got me up here for?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
I don't like it.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
That a fact?
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
I'm sure they will.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Political considerations?
Hey - the world is my office.
She married a hockey player.
Who knows? Fog, night...
Sidney Winch, meet -
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Why don't we just take these -
What the hell does that do?
Down?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
I am. What do you want?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
No -
Yes -
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
You okay?
Like muddy waters?
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You must have been really sick.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
How is he doing?
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
Hattie is a different person now.
Now who are we talking about?
Those boys never did have good luck.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
What must I do?
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Toy?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
I could have stopped him.
Right?  Buddy?
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
Spaceship.
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Woody, stop it!!
But why would Andy want me?
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
She's sick!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Will you quit moving around?!
A lunchbox?!
Who is it this time?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
ROOAAAARR!!!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
It's Sid!
Woody!  Speed up!
There's no mirror.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
Home is where the heart is.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
We're too young.
You're well built; how old are you?
I... I don't really know.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Why does he need money?
What is he planning on telling them?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Carl --
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
I get A's.  All A's.
I feel good.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
When will you do it?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
We aren't barbarians.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
That's good coke.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Like you protected Landry?
What do you mean?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Twenty thousand.
For fuck's sake.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Where are you going, Diane?
Sorry.
Holding hands?
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
Yes.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Unless you get caught.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
It's an interesting theory.
Now?
Yeah.
Exactly.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Lewis Gilbert.
The park?
What do you mean?
I don't rate that at all.
What?
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
What's on the menu this evening?
There.
How's it going with Gail?
Where did she come up with that?
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
MM.?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Not General Korrd.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
How do you know?
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Who are you?
No special conditions?

Did he say why?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
They'll start to soon enough.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
That all you can say?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Yes!
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
That was uncalled-for.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Flynn!!
Greetings, program...
Then...
There's another beam!
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
You think we can make it there?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Okay, Dad.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Thanks dear.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Abu Kaleem Malik.
I still don't believe it.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
They said you had to run out.
He needed my help.
Not because you were attracted to him?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
What were you doing there?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
What is it?
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Hello, Alabama.
I didn't get any chicken.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Tell him to look through it.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Tell me about yourself.
Turn-offs?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
How long have you worked here?
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Why?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Naw naw!
What?
Yeah.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Good for you.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Elliot.
Yeah?
What the fuck did you bring that for.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Who's Sonny Chiba?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
What do you think, eightball?
No. No, you don't.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Where'd you go?
What do you want from me?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I could do that?
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Or a supporting actor -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
Nicholson and I.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
No way, Jos.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
How do you know? You been there?
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Yes.
We want you to tell us about last night.
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
It's important to observe everything.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
I need to go.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
July.
It's just a shot to calm you.
"Never cry wolf!"
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
Give me the gun.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
What....???
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
But you know what's real now?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
That a fact?
Maybe I do.
You afraid of the dark?
More or less.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
One way, or round trip?
The ticket is thirty dollars.
What time is it now?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
How much!?
No charge.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
It is morning.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
You got beer?
What was that all about?
Let me get your change.
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Jake, what is that?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You sure you can manage?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Those are white words, not ours.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Like they're made of polyester.
I have ideas.
You never did answer my question.
Take me with you.
I can't.
Lied?  What do you mean?
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
John, please--
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
You got a suitcase?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
John . . .?
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
Well, nothing.
But I want to say with you,
Are you all right?
What for?
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
What brings you to Sierra?
I had a problem getting my car back.
I did?
What makes you say that?
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
How do you put a price on murder?
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
That's a bit much.
Do we shake hands?
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
What happened to your hand?
Got any requests?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
How old are you?
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Give it to me!
Nooo!
The old lady?
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
I don't understand what the--
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
It's the truth, Jake.
Come on, Jake --
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
What the hell are you talking about?
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Accident.
Don't look like nothing.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
What sign?
I like that about me, beautiful.
Where you coming from?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice place.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
I have an idea.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
I'm guessing no.
You could leave him.
Try me.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I don't know about that?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
Heineken?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Who was that on the phone?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
What about Jeb?
...I think rust.
I'm not sure.
Why?
Just give me a minute.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
No.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
Don't be scared.
Was your family traveling with you?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Well, go get it then.
Rain's coming.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Yeah, I guess.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Books. He's my biographer.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
He admit it?
Uh... a little, maybe.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Did you... kill him?
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
N-no, sir?
William Munny, yeah.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
He said that, huh?
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
When we gonna double back?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Is it him?
Wha... what f-for?
Lemmee see it.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Two weeks, I guess.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Nothin's bent.
I don't like the question.
His pistol must of jammed.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Maybe.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Goddamnit.
They just said they wanted time.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Why don't you just calm down'
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
You watch your mouth.
What-are they speaking?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
What call?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
I don't.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
You think he's..?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
This is going to drive the ante up.
What does it mean?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
That's right.
Well, we...
...We did everything we could...
Yes!
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
I know of him.
What book is that?
I wouldn't do it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Pardon?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Is this a bad time.
Yes.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
And what makes you so tough?
No...no...
Is it over?
Thank you.
Hi, Mickey ...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
How are you holding up?
I'm swell.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
What are you doing in New York...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I understand ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Thank you.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh.
Me, too.
How can I see her, to know her?
But you knew about this.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Hello.
Hello?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
I want to know who you are.
Will you have dinner with me?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
They're none of them right.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Yes.
Come here.
Scottie --
I made it.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Why?
Where had you been before?
Wandering about.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
I... didn't know where you lived.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Wander about.
What?
Meet again, sometime.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Do you hear anything?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Have you been here before?
Why did you jump?
I know.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
It wasn't your fault.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
I've never run across one like that.
Uh-huh!
Sorry, old man. Work.
What.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Johnny!
Pop Leibel.
I've told you enough.
Is she pretty?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What is it, a still life?
Yes! That's it!
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
The floor was wet. She slipped!
The hell I don't.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
There's more.
I'm calling the police.
We can't do this.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
We have to get going.
What does that mean?
Who? What are you talking about?
I want you to hear me out.
Have you thought about what I said?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
That's right.
I'm calling the police.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
What you just said. Say it again.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Whatever you say Kojak.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Easy Micheal.
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
The wedding cake check?
Florist?
Yes.
I think so.
Why what?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I wouldn't know.
You expect more what?
What kind of seats can we have?
Do you love me?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Hello.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Just kills me...
I love you dad.
That's just insecurity.
What does that mean?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Buzzing?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Where's Boyd?
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
Pup corn?
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Wasn't that cowardice?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
How much is that?
She's mad.
Me, rich? Come on!
She's left.
It's for people!
How much do you want for him?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
A black bull came.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Don't talk like that!
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
In English, please.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
You all right?
I've seen worse.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
On my life, I promise you I will.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Not from in here.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
What the hell happened?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
This is supposed to be years away.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
That's not true, Parker.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
I don't need a babysitter.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
What are you doing?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
What does that mean?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Real effective security...
Which way?
You're not capable of it.
Find out anything?
You okay?
Sid?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
For Schumann.
I don't think you're gonna need it.
...can we have a white one...?
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
Naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  Oh, Lord -- this just got <u>Big</u>.  I see it -- <u>Big</u> -- Big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
When do we bring'em back?
It won't hold.
It won't hold.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
What's it gonna cost? 
Yes.
...what's the Long View?
Yes.  That's true.  But...
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
...Stanley Moss...
Quite touching.
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
Heavy weather East of here.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
...Yes.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
...that's what it is.
"Back End" ... count on it.
...we get our hands on him?
Mmm.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
...that's right.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
I go with this here... 
All part of the Service we Render.
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
You like it?
It's tough to rhyme.
I believe in you....
...by you?
Yup.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
...gotta read my reports.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
...Got a 100 on me, you...
The FAA announcement.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
What if they call him?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Yeah, right...
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
My home number's on the back...
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
What does that mean?
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Hi.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
I can't...and I won't.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
But?
What's that?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Tony and China?
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
That's not what you said last night.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well?
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
So much.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
Uh-huh.  What can be?
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Oh-kay...
I've never even met you.
I wanted to apologize.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
You should have heard her play.
Good.  I'm good.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Yep.
I have to go.
I think so
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I think three...
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
It's today?
Not the focus.
It's just us now.
Of him I think.
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
...Don't get all...
There we go.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
I take it your not mad at me.
Who?
Your wife...
So you fucked a student?!
Claire, please don't...
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
How can you be sure?
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
The leaves...
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I don't believe you.
:Well, they are.
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Two what...?
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
Rowan.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Who is this...?
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Lie...?
STOP!
Explain this to me --- violated...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?
I LOVE him!
No!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
HARDER!
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Seems more like a year than a month.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Hello...?
What about your work back home...?
You sure...?
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Your beneficence.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
Which do you think is her best shot...
The one on the left - definitely...
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
It doesn't mention 'females only'
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
You don't know?
Where do you kill them...
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
And how did it feel to be rid of him
What is it?
Yes...
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
What?
I thought it was you - how are you?
Sugar?
You and your pep talks.
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
These are real, live women?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Which you pulled, hard!
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
God, you are so hot.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Son.
I guess.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
You're a peach.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
I doubt it.
It's all so complicated.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
I know.
He's on the move?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
You're quick. I like that.
Yellow pages?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You called the cops on us?
You do like girls, don't you?
Of course I like girls.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
What kind of ideas?
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Talk to me Artie.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Kelly.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
You could say that.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Where's the body?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
No.
He did say something.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
What about witnesses?
Are you crazy, Ray?
Thank you, Jimmy.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You can't...
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
About what?
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
That was about as grim as it gets.
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Shit. Here we go again.
J. S. Bach.
You need that real often?
Is this leading somewhere?
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
All that jumping and kicking.
Well... that, too.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Thank you.
This is good.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Relax.  We're almost there.
What?  President Grant is...!
There's only seventy-eight.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Your private train, sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Dr. Pemberton?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
This is something.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
Not today, Willow.
Say what?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Are you okay?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Dada, what's a daikini?
No!
That's all I ever wanted!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Tir Asleen.
Are you sure?
Who is he?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Hey, Sam...
...I want to say a thing.
Don't let them hurt you.
You know who?
Just us.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
What was that?
Now what's the problem?
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Oh? Anything else?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
Won him over just like that.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Where's my baggy pants?
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
God, Fred...
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Yes, I'm ready now.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
And him a brain.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Did they hurtcha?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Yeah. Me?
Where -- where do we go now?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
...Tin Man!
That's right.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
-- Ruined my exit!
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Makes her look even more innocent.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
I dont know what youre talking about!
Where did you get this?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Any word from him?
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Had a lot of blood in him.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Jon, where are we?
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
His what?
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
So do I.  So do you.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
I can fix it.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
I'm terribly sorry.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Am I free to go?
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
What do I get out of it?
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Not bad for a gimp.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
But programmable. And expendable.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Where are we going?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
You okay?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
What are you doing?
Nothing. He had two days.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
Sorry, "dude".
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
For what purpose?
I'll tell you one thing though.
Into the Hudson?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
What do you want?
What am I doing here?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Darling!
Hello...?
Yes.
Promise??
Oh, nice.
Goodbye, darling.
What a strange fellow.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
You mean... the laboratory??
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
How long will this whole thing take?
I didn't do that.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Nineteen, sir.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
There wolf!  There castle!
What are you doing here?
Could be worse!
That's not bad.
If you like -- just hurry!
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Can you play it?
I'm a failure.
How's everything?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Look, Doctor!
Raise the platform, hurry!
It looks that way.
Me?  Sing?
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I know.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
How do you know they're done?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
