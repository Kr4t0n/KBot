You're sweet.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
I believe we share an art instructor
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
The "real you".
Let's go.
I hope so.
Joey.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I just wanted --
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
Never
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
Thirty-two.
Get out!
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
I thought you hated those people.
Her favorite uncle
No, I ' m not.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Don't make me do it, man
She's partial to Joey, not me
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Away.
You need money to take a girl out
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
A hundred bucks a date.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Just a little.
An attempted slit.
That's never been proven
Does it matter?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi

That's what you want, isn't it?
Funny, you're the only one
Who?
Who?
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
You never disappointed me.
What?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Is that right?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
As a parent, that's my right
Funny.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Right.
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
Good enough.
Yeah.
Touch of the flu.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
I am, Your Eminence
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
May I ask by whom?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
No?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Island.  Far.
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Colon!  Don't!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
That she was impregnable.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You will regret this.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
He must be replaced.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
You bring the cigarettes?
What about Oleg?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Your mother was blind?
Yes, but he was a cop.
I will if they don't send me back.
Somewhere else?
Yeah.  This way.
No.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Go on.
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Vodka tonic.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Yeah.
No.  I'm okay.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
What are you saying?
Nah, why should you?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Hmmmm.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
Mind if I ride along with you?
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Raw deal.
Yeah.
My point exactly.
You know what I'm saying here.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Just a shower?
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Could be Leon's.
Answer it.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Thank you.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Dog food.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Two weeks.
He doesn't speak English.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Don't speak Russian!
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
How you erase this?
Don't want to film this?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Did you hurt her?
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
In love?  With who?
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
No way!  He's mine!
He's my collar!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Clean?
The clerk?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Don't stoop to his level!
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
How?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
No.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
He's got a point.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Yes, Daddy.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Fortunately, they did.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
I will if I can, Frank.
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
How about chargin' the battery?
Great, just great.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
You're crazy.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Thank you.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
You have a good time?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
The bet's off.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Hello. And goodbye.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Partnership?
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Yeah, I read the report...
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah?
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
You couldn't get to him?
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
I'll help you out.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
When? How?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Hey, you know what I really think?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Let's go, Reggie.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
You know exactly where they are!
They are robots!
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
She dropped in on me... holding this.
So you do know her.
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
That's what I thought.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We have to save the world.
Of course.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
I didn't know your size.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I was talking to the cat.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
Don't exist bud.
Like shit.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Leeloo..
...'Scuse me?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito Cornelius?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
You have nine points left on your license..
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Got it...
What mission?
Where have I heard this song before?
Why not?
I thought you were divorced.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Uh..you're welcome.
Which one?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
It's difficult.
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Uh..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Actually only one cell survived..
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Wonderful!
An elephant couldn't crack it.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Wait or act.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Honey, I'm not, please...
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
Don't...
Amy...
Mrs. Christian.
What are you talking about?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
A fellow investor.
Is it?
And they are?
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
What's the problem?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Take out your gun!
Bring the film, or we kill him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Eddie.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
Fuck you!
I want his name.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
I never killed anyone.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
I was well compensated.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Fuck you.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Good for you.
Max.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
What about me?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
You're learning.
Alright, I get the picture.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
He succeeded.
Just curious.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
I'm not positive this means anything.
The checks were for odd amounts...
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
How are you?  Having any luck?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I don't understand, who are... ?
Yes, but...
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
Why do you think he did it?
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
I remember.  You just left...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Okay.  Fine.
I don't want to.
Kristen...
I can't find him.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
I know.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
It's okay, we're just about there.
Save it for later.  Come on!
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
About Freddy?
What?
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Don't worry, honey
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Been having bad dreams.
No...
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
My friend, with the funny hand.
I know.
There you go.  Love you.
But Dad --
Now.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
My baby!
Meaning?
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Who?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Mark...
I can't listen to this.
He invited me to his house last night.
How is he - ?
But if they <u>do</u>?
Helen.  I appeal to you -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
What about down?
Right at our one-eyed friend!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Under <u>water</u>?
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Minus three.
- for horrors like yourself?
Your friend was to remain where he was!
Why?
Obviously.
Toward the Pole!
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
No.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
Tell me.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
How soon?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
I hear Twombley got shot.
That was me.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
You played for the Sox?
Really.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Shit.
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Yeah.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Sure you did.
Saw him do it?
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Break stuff?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
No.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
What are you sorry for?
Okay, let's go home, then.
You don't want the extra police pay?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
We should talk.
It's just...
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
You okay?
Said what?
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
You knew me as a kid.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Wade.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
How's that?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
What?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Nothing.
You no-good pup!
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
She's coming.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Yeah.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Wade?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Who?
What happened?
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about her?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Well, I never heard that one.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Back at The Fishbowl?
Your father never means to be so...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Yes dear?
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
You are a resilient man, Mr.
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
We don't know that.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Yes, Mr. President.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Where are we now?
Tower, here.
Scared. We're scared.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Say something dear.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Good. Good.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Got it.
Can't it wait?
She's a big girl.  She understands.
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
The fax machines.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Yeah, right.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
I might still have a few chips left.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Yes I did...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Ask Simon.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Let me by, Elaine.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Not now, Elaine!
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
Not now, Elaine.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Simon, what are you saying?!
Yes, sir.
Go ahead.
Request; life support systems check.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Can I hold him?
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
You're sure?
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Yes.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
No. I'm all alone.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
I can't tell.
Well...not for another two hours.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
He had fish.
He had fish, too.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
You expect me to believe that?
But if you'll just give me...
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
I love you.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
The gear is down.
Uh-huh.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Here.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I will, but Jim won't.
Huh?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Thank you.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Yes...
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Do it!
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Nice signal, dickwad!
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Nothing.
Nothing?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
I'll handle it.
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
How potent?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
The human?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Don't tell me what to think.
Would you, Sir?
Position?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Bullshit!
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Sorry to disappoint you.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Proceed inside.
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
What's the question?
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
We didn't miss anything.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
What about me?
Why not?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Gone.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Sure.  Go left.
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Certainly!
Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Is there a part for me?
How do you know?
Where?
Sir -
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Now?
Why?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Eat my - ah!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
No!
Wolfi!
What does she want?
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
I'm not telling you.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Why not?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
I understand.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Then he didn't send you?
Originals?
What do you mean?
I was at hand.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Gertrude!
Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
And the result satisfies.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Why not?
Oh?
Of course not.
Yes?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Thank you, Sire!
Ah, love again.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
How is your financial situation?
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Yes.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
This one will.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
Yes, thank you, sir.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
What medicine?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
So there you are. What do you say?
Why not?
Madame.
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Ah!
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
But this is absurd!
How could I not?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Oh, Excellency, would you?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
How much?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, please.
Are you ill?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
What time?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Yes.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I'm not leaving you.
What for?
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
But, Your Majesty -
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is what?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Is it true?
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
No? Was Mozart a good man?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
What difference does that make?
Never mind.
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Well done, Sire!
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
What? Who the devil are you?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Well, promise then.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Who is she?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Of course.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
A wolf.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Right.
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Now what do you want to talk about?
My best friend. My very best friend.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Don't you remember?
Jack is dead!
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
No what?
No.
No.
No what?
Has he been refusing food?
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
I was having a nightmare.
What time is it?
Where am I?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
So they said.
Yes.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Good.
She's a jerk.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
That's a wolf's head.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
I assume full responsibility.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Get out of here, Jack!
Hi, David.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
He's on the telephone.
Then you have some hot tea?
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
You here again? What do you want?
I want to know why .
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
What good will that do?
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
Just pure luck!
We'll discuss that in the board room.
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
You understand?
All right, Jack, all right.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Line?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Why are you so anxious?
My apartment.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Let me see your cash book, will you?
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Yes.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Well . . .
Directors, eh? Long faces?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Mr. Sampson . . .
All right. Send him in.
Got my letter?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Well, I
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
But I haven't . . .
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
What are you talking about?
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Come here, honey!
Oh now, don't be silly.
All right, dear.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
He was in the bank yesterday.
No. It wasn't earlier because...
There you are!
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I don't know.
What time did you get in?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Where's Charlie?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
That was two hours ago.
Leave me alone, Bob.
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
It's tougher than it looks.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Oh no...
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
It was exciting.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
I got three.
Sure, cousin.
I got us through the War all right.
That's it.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Well?
Sadie was not a man!
Strategically.
They're just insurance in case we run.
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
It's a secret.
What is it?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
So we got a plan?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You can shut up now.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
What do you think?
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Don't care.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
The posters?
And we're good at it.
If I could go back to farming --
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
We're doing this for Ma.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Oh yeah.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
So what was he?
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Mmmm.
Nuh-huh ...
You're sick of my company?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
You didn't want to farm?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Me neither.
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Yes ma'am.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
That's the idea.
Last February?
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
You been with a girl ever?
I swear.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Lyla Devereux.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
I look forward to seeing it.
Sir?
What, sir?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
I remember you.
This is no game.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Can't you tell me anything?
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
I know. Stop it.
Yes.
Pull out.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Take it off.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
I don't want to talk about it.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
He's good-looking.
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
We never really shared one.
But where?
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
There was no ad in the Times.
Yes, naturally.
What exactly do you mean?
No, you...didn't?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
It looks so soft.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Like what?
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
See you then.
Negative. Cancel it.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Hmmmm.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
What are I doing?
Why?
What do you think I do?
Well...
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
That's...that's too bad.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
She's from...France.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
No. I'm okay.
No, I'm okay.
Oh no, I'm okay.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
No, I guess it's okay.
Well...
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
Hmmm.
Oh.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
That's not the information I've received.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Not a big music fan, eh?
I'll be there.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
And?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Where was Marcus?
So who was he with?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm so hungry.
It's...it's...all right.
Oh well, you know.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Yes, it is.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
We're not gonna let it.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
What're you -- what?
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Milo. Why would he --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
So you believe me?
Oh, right. Hold on.
Like I said: shot in the dark.
My goodness.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Well -- you sent for me.
What're you implying.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
You've been coming in early.
...Worse?
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Just do what I'm asking!
Just do it.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You do?
Got out of my other commitment.
Cool.
You know my name.
You know mine.
Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
But why would they --?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
Who can we trust?
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Certainly not at my happy home.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
What?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
You may.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Groovy.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Yes?
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Be careful!
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
Excuse me?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Let me see.
How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Oh, yes you are.
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Not now, Austin.
Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Shut up.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Are you crazy?
I love you, Austin.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Where did you learn to shoot?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Dr. Evil?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
Not me.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Show me.
Scott, don't say that...
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
How's Austin?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
What about his teeth?
Did you ever want to?
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Scott.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Red ...
Fear ...
Peter ...
Impossible?
I have an appointment.
This isn't a game.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Ropes?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
Watch me.
To you ... ?
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
So am I.
Next assignment?
An unholy trinity ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Ring?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Rules are made to be broken.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Or half cocked.
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
As per mother's instructions.
For a man in my position --
Any other vices?
I wasn't about to.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
That's what we were working on.
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Orders.
I thought you didn't.
You don't trust me?
You lied.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Shall we?
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Have a look at this.
Where are you going?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
What kept you?
Still a bit chilly ...
I see.
Getting to what?
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
Amnesia?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
In your operation.
This way ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
You are, and it's behind you.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
What do you mean?
You're kidding.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
Hey, man, congratulations!
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
But how can I do that?
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
What are we having?
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
About what?
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Good...
Can't I just go with you guys?
You're really pissing me off.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Let's get naked.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
What are you...
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
You're a pimp?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
You can tell a man by his friends.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Right in there, pal.
I'm proud of you, lad.
I don't know.
Very.
Take care.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Roll the hose.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
You're selling dad's boat?
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I know.
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
Yeah...
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Hi.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
It's a small town.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
See you Monday. Sir.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
I don't guess.
I don't work for them, either.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
What reason?
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
Yeah.
Like it never happened...
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Nice boat.
Engine 115, right?
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Coffee sucked.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Firehouse.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Sorry I hit Jackson.
You can't keep being his father...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
That's your job.
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
-- Burn them.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
You don't know... nobody knows...
I need that report, Lt.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Who?
I'm a Catholic.
Yes.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
All right. What are you gonna do?
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
Don't bullshit me.
Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
That 50 G could help you --
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
How 'bout...
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
No offense.
Manray needs a job.
How much?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
That can be done.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
You have to start getting into your character.
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
This has to be a big mistake.
I want to speak with you.
Pleased to meet you.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
So what's up with you?
Nobody told me anything.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
Sounds risky to me.
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
The pleasure is mine.
Everybody shut up.
Is that good or bad?
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Light?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Give me the gun.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
I feel fine.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Yeah.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Not at all?
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Thank you.  And always smile.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
You've never had any formal training, either?
You sing and dance?
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
...the big apple, New York, New York.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
The one with da big...
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
I thought you got rid of...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
...no, she didn't...
...I heard different, thought that was...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
I don't know who I am.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
No, before my time.
Never read a book in my whole life.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Good morning.
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
As you please.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I have faced that problem before.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Agreed.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
By name only.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
May I be quite frank with you?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Yes, he's fine.
The milkmaid's daughter?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
He loves me, as I love you.
Tender Hegenheim.
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Fine.
I don't know!
HEY!
I'm not telling you what happened.
I'm serious --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
We've found all of them.
There were six of us...
Would you have believed me?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
How do you know that?
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
West... he's dead.
I...
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I didn't kill him --
But you didn't.
Mr. Hardy?
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Well?
Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
I didn't do anything --
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Maybe --
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Well, he's a good soldier.
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
Nevertheless --
Home, I'm done.
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's preposterous --
You knew Sergeant West?
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Yes.
Good cop/bad cop?
Something like that.
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Watch me.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
Little bit.
Let's go talk to Bill...
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
You mean the falsely accused?
So did I.
Nah.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Think it'll work?
Nah.
What are you talking about?
The faggot speaks.
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
He whispered it in my ear.
But you didn't see it, right?
Fifty minutes.
Wrong answer --
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
I used it to start the fire --
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
We know.
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
Thank you.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
It truly is.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
Please. Go. Just go.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
What were you dreaming about?
No, I understand.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Please?
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
I can.
Okay.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
I'm not scared.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You learned from the best.
So how does it happen?
You owe me three-fifty.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
The river?
Like this.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
'Fraid so.
Hello.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
You need to go.
Probably tonight.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Do you know who that is?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
So you never bought any land.
I paid for those guitar cases.
That's not a burn.
It is. I did it cooking.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
No I haven't.
I'm asking what you're here for.
He says he feels safe here.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
You must have a visa or something...
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Yes.
Syevodnya
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
No I don't.
In the world.
In every sense. If at all possible.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Why?
I got what I paid for.
Get out
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
She's alive?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
What was her name?
I'm not asking you to marry me.
I need to uh...
That'd be nice.
When? Now? Oh. No.
What do you need?
Hey.
No, ma'am.
Okay.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
You been home yet?
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Yeah.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
And you gonna live it with him?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
How long... how long I been out?
Well I don't...
Wait. He left.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Or what?
Whose doin' is that?
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
Sure.
The... chain helps.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Get a good picture in your mind.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Naw!
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Why's his britches round his knees?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
What's that chain around her for?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
This all looks wonderful.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Please don't tell my daddy.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What's on your mind?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Yeah?
Holy shit!
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Why?
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Charlie...
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
What?
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
Number five with a bullet.
First decent idea you've had.
You all right?  You okay?
Hey, all right.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Why the hell not?
I'll get him for you, Nick.
I can see that.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
I want to go talk to him.
So I bring some cheese?
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Me too.
Why's that?
There was a change in plans.
Gaiijin?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
He drinks.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember you saying no.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Tell them I'm not.
No one's keeping him here.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
She's such a long way home for you.
This by this...
Not in that company.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
Right.
We're police officers.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
Pris?
Then go get him.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Come here.
Why?
Also extraordinary things.
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Well, actually
Nexus - 6.
Of course not.
You could help us.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Yeah.
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
Day after tomorrow.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
I know all that.
I think we're through for the night.
The umbrella.
Thank you very much.
Sorry, don't have the time.
No problem.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Meaning?
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Nope.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You sure?
Can I come in?
What's suck night?
What shows?
I don't know nothing about it.
I'd kill it.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
I've already got more help than I need.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Not too good.
What?
Like?
Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
You mean a woman?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Black?
Yes.
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
No.
But in your profession that is a risk.
Five, maybe six.
Almost through.
Sorry.
What one?
Same thing.
I never seen a turtle.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
Pris.
I don't have one.
Oh.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Good.
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Eve? I'm leaving.
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Dickhead?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Oh, that's nice.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
You don't?
Nope.
And that's it?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
Perry?
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I can't, it's yours.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Okay!  Damn!
I think it's the eyes.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
What?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
They like Dr. Pepper.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Okay.
Name it.
What for?
They're all divorced?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
You said it would be easy!
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
So, what are you seeing?
That's boring!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Well...yeah. Okay.
Look unimpressed.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Did you?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I'm sorry.
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Goodnight!
I know first aid!
My pleasure.
My mother's like that.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Of course!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Like one of Mom's?
Merci!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
You nut!
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Russia.
Juneau.
Yeah.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
You bet!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
And thanks for always being happy!
My father is a genius.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Just look!!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Gladly.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Well, we're here to help!
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
You're my brave boy.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
What?
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Yes.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Well, put it down and come in!
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
As long as we've got that straight.
Thirty -five years!
To go up.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
I'm not hungry.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
Honey?
What shall we call him?
If I...you know...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Yes.  Well... yes.
What?
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Coming!
Would you excuse me?
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Yes.
--and we will--
Yes, dear, I know.
Amen.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Some time.
What are you doing here?
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
I see "elegant."
No.
Eve?!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
Yes, you do!
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
He didn't leave with them.
You're goddamn right I am!
What?!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
Then what?
What?!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Um...uh...
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Roger, Wolf One.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Yes?
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Who knows you have these?
Not yet.
Yeah.
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I'll go then.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Do you know?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Yeah, hurry up though.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Frank is coming?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Sometimes I think I do.
No, it's not Don.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. Are you?
Yes.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
My secret lover.
Don? Where is he?
Bull.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Mommy's here.
You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
No thanks. What does that mean?
I don't want to go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
Okay Frank.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Good, let's drink up.
Be right down.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Yeah. okay.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Are you feeling okay?
It's good to see you, Dad.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Where are they?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know. He moved away.
Yeah. Good bye.
I don't know.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah, but.
OK.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
That's what I thought.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
See ya tomorrow.
Oh yeah?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
Jeffrey? Why?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Just a minute.
Okay.
Frank!!!
No Jeffrey!!
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Okay.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
The Duke?  What did you do?
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Any word back from the E.R.s?
This is a six-shooter.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You gotta keep going.
Ma, what's wrong?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
me up the...
Shut it. It's Ma.
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I don't know they just always need it.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Yes, we are.
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Can she I.D. them?
Where's my cat?
Pee...Per...Man.
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
And the pennies?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Eight.
Who were the victims?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
I...
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
We promise.
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
I'll be back at 9:00.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
You sure you killed them?
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Y-Yes my son.
You believe?
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
You know them personally?
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
Open it!
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Yeah boss?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
She's an attractive older woman.
What do you think the cops have?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Yeah, I heard that.
Just turn right here.
You think we're going to be chased?
You're right. You're right.
There's another stocker, right?
We got it. We got it.
What do you think?
You were spoiled rotten.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
No. We didn't.
Which one was that?
Bob?
Where was I?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
What?
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Don't panic, Anthony.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Our money situation is not good.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
We've got sixteen dollars.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Let me feel that.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I'm sorry, Bob.
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
It's like we've finally arrived.
I don't think you will.
Where's Kumar?
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Oh, I'd say about --
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
No. I'm not.
Nice to meet you.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
It feels good.
No. Bob did.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
See you, Bob.
OK, Dad.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Is that OK?
Why do you say that?
Jesus Christ! No.
Sure.
Who's got the car keys?
No.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Cuba.
I hear you're a good thief.
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
The front stairs.
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
I don't know about that.
The one and only Little Richard.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Not even for emergencies?
No.
They are.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.
Yes. I did.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
That's my responsibility.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
So it's my fault?
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
We'll have to see when we get back.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
What's his name?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Look. We want you on the job.
Yeah?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Here we go.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
He said what?
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
Oh, yeah.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Well, I think --
What can we do?
Where?
She Chicano, yes?
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Never heard of it.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
May I finish?
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
No. You lost your way.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Lots of people...
Show me again...
Okay.
Yes...
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Is this really happening?
Drop it.
Pamela Landy?
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I'm sorry.
-- what? --
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
But we were so careful.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Where --
We can't wait to be sure.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
What is this, a game?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
That's a lie!
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Who's going? Us?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
Now. Show now.
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
That's where we came out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
And why is that?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
By who?
Yes. In that order.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
It is suicide.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
He has already agreed to come.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
I have ordered conscriptions...
Scotland. He intends --
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Wallace's followers.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
You fancy him.
Hamish, I... thank...
I rest.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
That depends on the man.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
We don't split up!
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Humbly, M'lord.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Let her speak.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I do not confess.
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
It does me good to see you.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
What is it?
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Can't he come out for one day?
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
What? What could he do?
How long will I be in here?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Where are you now?
No, protecting her.
What?
Fuck off, frat boy.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.
What do you want to know, Evan?
I know, but...
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
He's a fucking maniac!
I get it. You can drop it now.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Different? How?
Know what?
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
I was?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Who -- who are you?
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Me neither.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
I thought I was the bad guy!
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Does he know that?
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
-- Will he keep his word?
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
A champagne cocktail, please.
Monsieur Rick!
How long can I afford to stay closed?
It's not for sale.
You haven't heard my offer.
Suppose we do.
My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
Practically no one.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
You needn't be concerned about me.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Not an easy day to forget.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Why there is no other man in my life?
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You can believe that if you want to.
Richard, I had to see you.
Please.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
And Laszlo?
I wish I didn't love you so much.
No, not yet.
Everything is quite all right.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
We'll discuss it later.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
No, Victor, there isn't.
-- Is what?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Your work.
We all try. You succeed.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. It's all arranged.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Here it is.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
I expected no less, Captain.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
A leader, like Laszlo?
I see what you mean.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
Victor Laszlo?
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
He'll take one.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
The winning side would have paid you much better.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
-- Thanks. I will.
Huh?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
Oh, thanks.
Put that gun down.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
There seems to be no secret about that.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Get me the Radio Tower!
Hello Ugarte.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
-- You thought what?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
No.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Worse than Warsaw.
Take it.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
I'm putting it off.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
You are.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
They're harder to do than they look.
Well, not really, I --
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Had a package to deliver.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
I thought I did.
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
Not if you work for FedEx.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
He's your cute thing.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
No.
I can't take him to work.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
You too.
Terrific.  Yours?
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Sure.
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
The place is falling apart.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
I wanted to come here.
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
It was fifteen minutes late.
I was making a point.
Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
That's why you're a gambling man.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Life is waiting.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
They just want you to hire some new help.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Dr. Homer Wells.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
I know.
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Good night, Daddy.
Two.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I've never seen a lobster.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Where's Mandalay?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
You don't understand! It's her father...
Nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
He's *paralyzed*!
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Yes, I *have*!
I can't go nowhere.
Why?
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
*Liver* killed him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
You still doin' it too fast!
Okay. Then you can be of use.
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
Right?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
It looks like scurvy.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Right.
We heard that one already, Homer.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
Almost.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
Sorry, Homer...
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
She took off on the bicycle, man.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Silicon Valley?
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Just the last three weeks.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Like what?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
After you cut her loose.
We'll take care of it.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
We're going to give him the money back?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
We pay better.
She's up for it.
Minus one.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
No. Just confidence.
I think two million.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Help me.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Did I miss something?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Intuition.
WHAT?
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about the money?
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Your mess.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
Breasts.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
It's not history.
So what do you want?
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
I try.
A Fed? Is he close?
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Maybe another time.
Why did you quit?
I got scared.
I despise the job.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
What are you talking about?
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
What's the Blue Book price?
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'll try and make it.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
You mean I won't resist them.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
I love you Jack, you know that.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Probably.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Nothing about you.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
Well, thank you anyway.
Impossible to calculate.
There's a casino in this hotel.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not.
I'll watch.
You choose.
Who's they?
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
It won't.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
I can't do it, Jani.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I have to take the car.
Jack! It's Jani.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Did you solve your problems?
Ross.
You did?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Over the river.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
I'll tell you later.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
It was you, you shit.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
We do. 
I don't think so.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Very impressive.
Fine.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Key?
The key!
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Check at six minutes.
Thanks.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
Hey, bomb.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
But how do you know you exist?
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
This is fun.
Why don't you have more time?
To explode, of course.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Any planets?
What?
Wha?
Who cares?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
What happened, Doolittle?
No kidding?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Ah... pity, pity...
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
No?
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
How I make my living, what's your point?
I'm on a break.
Yeah?
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Leave.  Now.
Can I say something in my defense?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
Police drone.
No time.
Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I'll make it worth your while.
It's a rule.
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Hello...
Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
Mommy, I'm scared.
First time I ever heard that.
Whoever that is.
Wasn't that hard.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Lauren's not my wife.
Girlfriend?
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Something.
I won't be staying.
Bent.
We are not fine.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
No, I meant this.
The other one like you...
You did go through my stuff.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
You said you could help.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
I already don't like the sound of this.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
Somebody's got to.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Well, not me personally.
We're quoting Mom again.
With your help.
But she does work here?
I need to talk to her.
A friend of your fiance's.
What do you want?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
You're also a fool.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
You and me both.
Got a pencil?
I'm on my way.
Straight.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
You get it when I get her.
You're the best, Maxie.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Tell everybody hey.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
What's up?
Max--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Exactly.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
I'll give it my best shot.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
She was the one--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
True, but--
Shut-up...
Theo's dead.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Got any KISS?
Yeah, a man's drink...
I-I c-can't...
It's okay.
You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
Oh, screw it!
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
What? That's disgusting!
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
One more time in English.
Check!
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Sunday, but...
Curly.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Sure.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
What?!
Yeah.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Yeah.
Yeah, you did!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
What happened?
Yeah.
Did you know him?
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
Theoretically.
Like a spear.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Where did you come from?
Take it off. I want to see you.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
We never would have had this conversation.
Will you go with me?
And you'd never been there before?
With, like, images?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
And what?
Well...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
What?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Maybe she's asleep.
What's wrong with you?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
My mom is gone.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Where are we going?
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Where it came from?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
I know, Dad.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Why should we care?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
I met a girl.
How are things going at school?
What else do you think about during school?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Do you feel alone right now?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
The good stuff.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
I think now that he might...
Where are we going?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Frank is going to kill.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
What else?
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
I guess they made him do it.
Kitty...
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
But now you can't go.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
There's no rule!
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Raspberry.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Oh-yah.
Really, Loretta?
Thank God for bunge cords.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Yah?
Oh-you-beccha.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
This, this... This is bullshit!
I just did.
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Here, have some.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Yes...
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
This here's Loretta.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
Shut it up, Loretta.
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
And the year before that?
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Gladys! Stop it!
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
And wear a crown and everything.
The king can do no wrong! 
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
They think I should - They think I should - They think I should - They think I should be king.
Who to?
The President of the United States.
"My President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Well - what is he now?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
He only weighs ten ounces --
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Did you shoot the rapids?
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
What did you say to her?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
That's not bad for any day.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Are you getting tired?
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
You swine!
You worm!
You upstart!
That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
I didn't come here to be insulted.
Oh, would you...?
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
I intend to.
He must have taken quite a fall.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
You don't own this man!
Right... Right.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Indeed!
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Well, yes.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Please do.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
What a mess.
I don't know what I've got.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Alas, no.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
You're English.
Yes.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Good morning.
The main spire.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
My... name is...
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Of course.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
No, he's very upset about something.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
What are what?
What was she like?
We never went to bed together.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
You're as bad as my father.
And the week before that?
Halfdan the Black.
I'll bring it back.
That's right!
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
The second note to wake the Gods...
Not quite...
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
What d'you mean?
Well... isn't it great?
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
REALLY?
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Yes... oh, yes...
What about the raping?
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I don't suppose... no...
What?
Well you started it.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Why?
Find it... AND cross it!
You talking piffle, son?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
That's my boy!
Sorry.
You may need a real Berserk.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
Why should WE care?
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Who gets killed?
Just say something cheerful.
But how could he know... unless...
We'd be the first!
Over the Edge of the World.
You're wasting your time.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
That's it!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
Help!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
It's not my business any more!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did my father and his father before him.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Sh!
Helpless...
I hate you! I hate you!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Here we are.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You rat.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
I'm sure you would.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I don't know what that means.
Yes?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
I'm fine.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
No, not at all.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
When?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
It's three.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
No. Thanks.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Egad, were you horrified?
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
And I didn't have an argument.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Yeah?
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
You said --
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think, before.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
What are you doing?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
It's dark.
Naomi.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
What if you stay this time?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Joel, come here. Please.
Hey, Joel --
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I guess so.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
I just got in.
Long day thinking.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
It's too late.
Any messages, Carmen?
And what are you like? A wino?
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
What?
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
In a minute.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Sorry. I just --
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
We haven't checked.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
That's a good one.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yup.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
Can I... I brought some --
Then why did you ask me?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Well, thank you, Mary.
How do you mean?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Oh dear.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
She likes you okay.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
Easy come, easy go.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
I don't.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
Why? Why do you have to go?
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
A job for me?
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Justin?
I think I found something...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
What?
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
What?
No, thank you.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
You're okay now, it's over...
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Run!
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
We'll make it.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
What happened?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Nothing. It's nothing.
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
Does he know that?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
From the Other Place...
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Justin. I won't let you die.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
There's no one here, Skipper.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Do it.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
That's what we're here to find out.
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
The date.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Where has it been for the past seven years?
You can't, your orders are specific...
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Son of a bitch!
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
You know.
NOOO!
What is that?
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Yes, sir.
Where is it?
Starck...
Starck, give me a read.
We have a situation here...
They're gone.
Understood.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Come again, Skipper?
Get out of there now!
No. It was someone else.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Stay here! Don't stop working!
Five seconds.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
...repeat, we're armed...
He's been past Mars?
He served on the Goliath.
They're explosive charges.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Do you know what it was?
It's cold.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
She's not ugly.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Get them back --
I'm trying, goddammit --
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Do they have pressure?
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
It wants me. I have to go.
I'm alright. Please.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
Oh, he did.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Victor must've taken him.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I already got it. Everything I want.
You'd never know it.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Don't you wander off, boy.
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
That's terrible news...
So are you!
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Ben, are you there?
You've been working out.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
But all these people...
Please tell me you go silent too.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
That's the temperature of the sun.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
What? What do you mean you --
We need to get past them.
Are you kidding?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Why didn't you say something?
Not at all.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
Ben did this.
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Oh, I think you already have.
Skeptical...?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't strain yourself.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
I didn't say that.
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
What a guy.
Well...
Come on...
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
Did you get her number?
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Really?
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Ace the jacket.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Chicken!
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
Yes.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
What should I do?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Hey! That's my line!
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Sixteen.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
No. But it's a nice idea.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
It couldn't be.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Sometime?
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
What class?
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I don't know. I guess so.
Well, you'll find out next year.
If you graduate.
I know, everyone says that.
How about your phone number?
The point sounds fine.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes.
Sure thing.
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
No. That's okay.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
What's April 16th?
What about the notes?
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Okay. Thanks.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Well, thank you.
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Tell me. What do you want?
WHAT?
Dobermans don't talk.
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Not down in my parts.
A major!
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
What do you mean by that?
Las Vegas.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
Hell, no!
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Lacerda?
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
GO?
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
He told me he was turning in early...
What tape?
Whatever's right.
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
NO! Stop talking like that.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
That's a strange attitude.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Where is everyone?
Nah, I got the gun.
Anyone.
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Get in line!
Why don't you go check it out?
Who's with me?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your parents of relation?
We gotta try.
What's in the back?
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
The girl's got rhythm.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Four door?
Covered.
How many?
Whoa!
Sit still, look less like a meal.
You smell like ass!
What the hell's going on here!?
Clear!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
What?
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Whoa!
We all have to be strong, right?
Right.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
I'd love to.
I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
What're you doing?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Oh. I mean, good.
Thank you --
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
My clothes?
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
I know, but --
He knows, Frances.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
GET OUT!
Showdown.
Dick, we need some time apart --
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
What night?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
No.
I know.
...Then go.
Be careful, Francie.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Always. Always.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Thank you.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
But, Kurt, I...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Oh, Kurt!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
What is this?
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Whattaya mean?
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
What?
...So you think I should go.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
What?
Oh no...
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Harry... I met someone.
Yeah.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Forget it.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
The hell you will, Harry York.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I know.
What for?
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
I should've known...
What?
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
What's that?
What a man!
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I love you too, Frances.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
I hope so, Frances.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Well... you're looking well.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Why do you say that?
No, we're not.
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Fine!
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Your big speech?
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
I'll be back.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Frances!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I have!
I don't believe so.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Normal. Average.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Really? Any problems?
Huh?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Then why weep for him?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
How did you find me?
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Is he not back yet?
Aren't you?
Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I will be here when you return.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Is that your diagnosis?
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Philosophical?
Despite the lack of challenge.
Victor, explain yourself.
Why?
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
I was careless.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
You want to leave?
Thanks, Alice.
I finished the boats.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
I'll go take a look.
Hey, guys!
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
You're welcome.
I meant everything.
No, they won't...
A short somewhere.
Where's Ned?
Whatever you make yourself.
Good call.
I love you.
You? The brick?
Lead the way!
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Mmmmmmmph.
Umhummmmph.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
For two lonely nights.
Why not?
Another coincidence.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
He's running the show.
On the dresser.
Come again?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Yes, she is.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
To yours.
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
Yep.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Ain't it the truth.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
Not good enough, swear to God.
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
Everybody goes home!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Sure.
Where are you taking us?
What did I say?
Do you believe me?
I'm really sorry.
Noooo!
Not many.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
-- This conversation is over.
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
She's in the other room.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
What does that mean?
No, I didn't.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
This ain't the time.
Really?
I'm here with you.
Okay, I'll have one.
That's what I hear.
The woman I saw you with...
Who's...  Lieuten --
What'd you find, Kathy?
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
Standing right here in my office.
Of course, but there's more --
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Didn't take long.
Oh, really.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Across the board, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Sir?  What did he say?
Motherachrist...
Entering my scan now...
I'll act surprised.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
No, ma'am.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Chances of recovery?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
So dump on me.
Which is guy-speak for...
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Me?  Why me?
I saw an article...
I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
And how do you know that?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
He was married?
Not me.  You?
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
Mighta been civilian.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Should I be afraid?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
No.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Funny, the C.O. says I can.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
So am I.
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Big bites.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
What?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
No.
You must have quite some harem.
Yeah, well...
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
I got pretty close.
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
I was wrong.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Can I use some?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
It's your choice.
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Oh, I'm not married.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
But you don't know for sure!
You don't have the authority to do that.
We know.
We, have already taken care of them.
Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
Makes us look more American.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's Raymond.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Thanks.
Right... Sorry, sir.
"The show must go on."
Leadership....
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
Nothing.
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Shut up.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Oh can't I? Watch me!
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
What?
No I didn't.
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
Yes Commander?
What do you mean?
Wait two seconds then go.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
No, no... I'll think on it...
Right.
Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
It's ... incredible.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right. Put me back on with him.
It's... I don't know.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
But I'm the Commander!
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Let me think. I need time to think.
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
I don't think that's a cloud...
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Don't be ridiculous.
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Turn on the translation circuit.
Mark 12.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
We.. We lie.
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
I... certainly, but-
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
But there it is!...
But... Inside, I have seen-
You can oc that?
Wh... Where are we?
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
What kind of signal?
Tommy, we have these...
Pedal to the metal...
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Get oacK on their tail.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
The army can survive without me.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
While they're strung out?
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Well... I misunderstood, then.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general?
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
Delighted, sir.
Therefore, retreat.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
Oh, come now...
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
Detained by what?
The British army, sir!
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
The man is a traitor!
How can you say that?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
I... they look both the same.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land.
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
What else?  From Virginia?
To win this war I need an army.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Yessir!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Africa, of course.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
That land belongs to the strongest.
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
So you didn't have the key with you.
Not too bad.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
Harry, let me answer that.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
I don't believe this.
I'll find it.
What?
I'm working on a few things.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
Leo, I don't know.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Or else what?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
That's right.
You have a card in here?
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Leo spanked a waitress?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
Ever shot anybody.
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Who's the star?
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
Never say anything unless you have to.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
So you want to know.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
One we're producing.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
How do I know that?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
How? By taking my money?
I'll find you, Leo...
Maybe you don't see my sign?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
What're you doing here?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Don't go out of your way.
And you think the movie business is any different?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You bet.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Whatta you doing out there?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Thanks.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
With that coxswain dickhead.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Lemme see.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Why not.
What?
What?
Maureen.
No.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
I like my job.
Gimme a break.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
What?
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
If you get it back in one piece.
Sounds reasonable.
But how long?
Hard to say.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long, then?
Goddamit, Dodge.
Yeah, yeah.
Not in the eyes of the law.
So whoever did this might still be around.
What do you propose?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
I don't know what you're talking about?
You smashed it!
What the fuck -- ?
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
There's a charming thought.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
You're a pal.
No.
Yeah. Thanks.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
Only something must've gone wrong.
What?
February first.
The same day she supposedly went down.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
The what?
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
Showing you what?
Right here.
Maybe it was more than that.
It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
What?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I think I see it pretty well.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Of course they did.
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Sorry.
We've done it before.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Ho, baby!
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Drink up then.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Leave it.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Fifteen, at the most.
What is it now?
Are you going to yell at me?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
But I can't --
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
So what do you think?
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
No.
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Then why do you hate me so much?
How long have you been up?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
You loser.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Hey, look at this...
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
What does that even mean?
Oh, we totally have to.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
You're better at it.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
She says she wants to MMPH!
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
Come on, it's too late now...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
It's always closed...
"Hassle"?
Why don't you ask him.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
It'll only take a second.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
Where?
You cunt!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Don't you want nice stuff?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
You're insane.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
When was this?
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
So where's all your stuff?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
I dunno...
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
It just came yesterday...
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
How much is this?
Where did you get those pants?
That's not even --
...are you waiting for a bus?
Yes.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Later, "Dude".
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
NO!!!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Every guy has a type!
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Shh!
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Jesus...
It's not hopeless...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
You work at Cook's Chicken?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Are you okay?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Really?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
Just someone so young...
Uh... sure... come in.
What's the matter?
Do you have anything to drink?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
What?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
I-I-I...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Call me sometime.
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
What are you talking about?
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
Let me see the sick.
There is no reason for fear.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
I think it's been a pleasure.
You've never built in Africa.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me. 
Then why do you stay?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
That is correct.  Nothing.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Have you got that in writing? 
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
We need to talk.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
That's very considerate.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
Only in life... 
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
You've known him long?
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Hold your son high. 
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Occasionally
Does he ever mention me?
Thank you.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
I'll supervise.
Okay, let's take a look.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
Does she know anything about babies?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Like what?
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
I knew that.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
From where -- Neptune?
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Nine feet -- ten --
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Who, Ray?
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
I'm Peter --
I'll get one more reading.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
No, I just thought --
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Wonder what?
Well, thanks a lot.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Ummm -- figure eight?
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Eight o'clock?
Are you sick, Louis?
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
No?  What do I act like?
I told you, I ...
I know.  It happened by itself.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I think I should spend the night here.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Goodbye.
Who's the stiff?
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
But why?  The students love us!
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
We'll get back to you.
Die in what sense?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
I don't believe in luck.
What calls?
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
A square?
Two wavy lines?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Then my theory was correct.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Wow!
Why not?
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
What is it?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
God, it's ugly!
Neutronize.  System shut.
I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
I don't think it's Shandor.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Do you believe in God?
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
LATER, MAN!!
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You're coming back?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Not yet, dear brother...
Send them out!
Do you want posters, too?
Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
That's difficult to say, general.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
You flatter me, Caesar.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
So am I.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
That's what worries me...
Only from a distance.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
So I understand.
Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
Narcissus!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
You teach them!
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
No.
I'd love some.
I don't know.
No.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
What?
Is anything wrong?
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
I'm glad.
Benjamin -- I really do.
What?
You mean the one who --
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
But you're not enrolled.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- really incredible --
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
I think it is.
What did she say?
I don't feel well.
If you want.
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
No.
What?
But you might.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
We just can.
You really will?
Tomorrow?
Yes.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Not exactly.
One of those outside agitators.
I want you out of here.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Well I'll hand it to you.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Right.
Where are you?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
The Singleman party, sir?
A single room or a double room?
Will you sign the register, please?
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
Will you take me home?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
I don't know.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
What?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Benjamin?
Won't you unzip my dress?
I know that. But I'm --
Come on.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Yes, I have --
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
But they would! Don't you see?
What?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Get away from that door.
Let me out!
Do you understand what I said?
Thank you for taking me home.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
A drink? Of course.
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
That's fine.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Thank you.
Benjamin.
Yes?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
What?
You what?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Oh my God.
No.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
There!
There isn't any.
He's asleep.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
What?
Right.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Man, is this interesting.
Is it?
What?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
I'm curious.
I don't think we were the first.
Do you remember the make of the car?
No.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Then let's hear them.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Yes.
I wouldn't know.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You wouldn't.
If that's how you feel --
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I don't think so.
Sir?
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What else?
But I don't want you to make up something.
Goodnight.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
About an hour ago.
About what?
What about it?
To be what?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
You got me.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Oh no.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?
Oh no.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
No, I don't.
HUH?
Benjamin Braddock.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Why?
Why?
No --
With the pearls --
I'll pay you back.
You might find a bullet through that head...
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
That.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Too bad.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
Money.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Yes -- oh!
What do you want here?
Why do you hide in my room?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
You are beautiful!
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
For Vienna?
Why do you think --
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Oh, a Baron! 
Yes, quite.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
I've no luck.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
And the child isn't coming?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
No, Doctor.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Yes.
I never danced before -- in public.
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Tired?
Moreover...
Moreover... 
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
Not too quickly.
You're a little too fast.
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Tomorrow morning.
Insolent young cub!
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
No water -- What a place!
All you have to do is phone for it.
We did not approach you.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Oh -- but it can't be.
Why not?
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Please.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
I could not think of not accepting.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
I know -- I know.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Good night.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
Your what?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
Motherhood.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And if you do it wrong?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I like you, too.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Fine.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
It's not your fault.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Roy Dillon.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
No?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Perk, remember?
How come?
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
Get off the grift, Roy.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
I've really got to --
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
I'll get it.
Uh-huh.
Never.
For God's sake, Lilly!
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
A future. The only future I've got.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Just trying to help, Lilly.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
I'll see you when you get home.
See you soon.
What?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Myra, I'm not following this.
Nobody does that single-o.
I've heard the name.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Gun?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Happy to see you looking so good.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Well, when you put it that way.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Where?
I can be real stiff.
Charming.
Detective...
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Nothing's missing?
My life is a living hell.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Will, sit down...
I don't know.
Get on the bus.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
I borrowed it.
I can't afford to get caught.
I came to see you.
Can I come in?
Here, take my jacket.
Yeah.
Who?!
It's always John.
It's not going to happen.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
You're unbelievable.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Thanks!
Very insightful.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
We can light our own tree at home.
You've been watching too much TV.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
God ... this can't be true.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Him.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
He's gone.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
Or what's left of him.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
I'm gonna wet my pants.
You know what gets me?
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Must have changed that law.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
The hell with the diamonds!
What'll you do for transportation?
You ever own a motorcycle?
How about breakfast, wife?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
What's this?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Me?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Is Penelope in?
You've come to the right man.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Blue soup.
I've considered that.
What?
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Out!  Out!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
College?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
England?
Oh hell.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
You're supposed to get hurt!
They're not engaged.
Sir?
Can't it keep till morning?
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Scat!
No.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
You don't even know me.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Not at all.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
Situation.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
We thought it was an emergency.
We all are.
Thank God!
Say hello to your mother.
I did?
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Ram it up your ass!
They don't have to feel like slaves.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
No.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
What are you going to do?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Sneaking in the back door.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Just one favor.
Rifle?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
No you don't.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Load it for her.
Out!
You've killed women?
It's always locked.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
She's fine.  Please--
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
What a brilliant diagnosis!
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I've never heard of it.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
We have, have we?
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Correct.
Now who's being cruel?
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Comical?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I've struck my blow.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
My violin is avenged!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
If you want to be found that way.
I've enjoyed being man.
No.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
New lives begin!
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
She did?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
How horrible.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
What a relief!
I'll kill myself.
No.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
A what kind of doctor?
Not true.
How did she lose her feet?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
For Heaven's sakes!
What?
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
Okay.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He is my father.
No!
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
Doing what?
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
You figure!
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
How nice.
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
How long has this been going on?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
We made the date three months ago.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
Tonight's the night.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
That's the XKE.
What kind of a life is that?
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
We've got to rescue him.
He's not your son.
That's been said before.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
No, just not the type.
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Do you want to take a session?
Well, I want to...
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
You want a tip?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
What girls you got here?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
What's that shade of blue called?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
If you say so.
The other girl is the star?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
You're not a film producer, are you?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
I am.
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
And your wife? Where's she?
She's dead.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
Is that the way it was with you?
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
No.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
They are the same.
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Where is he, Niki?
...What do you have to offer?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Who's paying you?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
The police? They know less than you do.
Do you think she's safe?
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Pretty good.
What?
What is going on?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
I don't know.
Where!
You're talking about real excitement?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Ratan!
It's a short film.
I don't know nothing, man.
That's all right.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
In other words, you want to get laid?
Not exactly...
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
I don't know.
You never heard of that?
Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
You're taking a big chance.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Thanks.
Yes, I am.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Yes.
No, no. I just took it.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
None of that, lady.
We planted it.
Officer, I can explain.
Check.
Then whose name is it registered in?
What kind of a car is it?
I'm a file clerk.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Yes.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Promise?
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
She seemed yare to me.
Me! No. Of course not.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
It is kind of rough.
Well, I really don't drink...
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
No more revolts.
I don't know.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
You are the wisest person I know.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Where's that?
What is it, Harold?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Oh, Harold. 
Farewell?
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
A sunflower?
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Perhaps it is.
No. My uncle.
Like a tea ceremony?
And why is that?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
None at all?
Your classmates?
Thank you, Uncle.
ZAT!
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Time to play.
You knew?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
If anyone can help, HE can.
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Are you crazy?
Kyle, you don't have...
I've got to finish it.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
It's been Hell.
Steve...
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
See what??
Story of my life.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
See? I don't like that --
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
What is it?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
I think that is its hand.
I thought you liked being on TV.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Who wards off demons.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
You're doing fine.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
I knew those men better than you did --
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Those things never work. Never.
I'm in charge. We go back!
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hostage negotiations.
Shh! Just a second.
Not from you.
Alone?
How big can it be?
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Good.
Doesn't sounds like him.
Cocky.
I know.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
Coffee's warming me up.
Oh, sod you.
Uh-huh.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
I have to speak to my father.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
This isn't happening.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
One last time. Give me the box.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Bastard.
Oh my God.
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
Frank.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
Hurting.
Keep your voice down.
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
I have to see my father.
I saw everything.
We're going to freeze to death.
Just a thought --
Ah!
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
Let me see.
You're done worse.
Larry....
Are you O.K.?
Can I get you anything?
I'll be down in a minute
O.K.
Fine.
No. I'll do it.
Don't go upstairs.
It's better you see for yourself --
Drinking alone.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
You want something to drink?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
No personal details?
No.
What's wrong?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Call me tomorrow.
Never better. You sleep well.
I guess.
Finished?
I'm afraid it's true.
Show her.
No. It's all over.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
I beg your pardon?
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Well what's the point in that?
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
We can take your car.
What are you snickering about?
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
Ehh.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Ha.
How do you know about that?
What the fuck is that?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Laura.  Her dad died.
Ooh.  Drag.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Fuck off, Barry.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
No, you can't.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Nothing.
Why?
He's not worth it!
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Right.  Why?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Oh.  Okay.
Is that it?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Yeah.
What's his name?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Huh?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
I'll tape it for you.
Fine.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Who's that?
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
I dunno.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
What were the others?
I don't know.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Is it better?
Of course it is.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
You know what I mean.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
Sure they are.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
No, no.  When are you going home?
In a minute.  When I get it together.
Uh... No.
Mmnn.
What do you mean?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
C'mon.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
To make you feel better.
Okay.
How?  How were we the same people?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
More confident, maybe.
I'm alright.
How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
Nothing.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
WHAT?
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I know.  I don't get it.
I'm going to talk to you.
Right.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
It's true!
What difference does it make?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
It's a great song.
I understand completely.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
I'm sure it isn't.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Good.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Everything all right?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Whatever.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
He'd want to know about all this.
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Claymore.
It's in good condition.
The boy _died_?
Would you remember his name?
Carl Smith.
Yes.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
I've been to Church Hill.
Where?
Not your concern.
What about me?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
Are you?
No.  I had to talk to you.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
I wish I could.
Yes.
It's beautiful.
A little dusty.
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
You won't.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Yes.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
Will I see you again?
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Thanks.
You and I should talk first.
Spare me the details.
What are you getting at, Moran?
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You're an asshole, Moran.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
What were you doing in Felton?
Why?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
-Luceat ei-
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Stop!
Aye.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
You're a long way from Inverness.
It was time for our paths to cross.
I don't know why.
I'm twenty-two.
What?
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Again.  Try again.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
That is not me.
I'll be back when I can.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
Like you.
So sure?
What is your position?
We have no understanding.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Either you are with me or against me.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Thanks.
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
Figure she's with him?
Yeah.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
He knows I'm here.  How?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
What are you doing here?
It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
It's all we have.
Get up.
Yes.
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
That's none of your business.
All I need is time.
You're a kind man to be sure.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Just your pappy scared some.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Hello, Bensinger.
Excuse me, I just want to --
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
Exactly!
I'll come a-running, pardner.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
I lost my wallet.
The check, Bruce!
Yes, wasn't it?
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
I see what you mean.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Thanks a lot.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
No, you don't!
The power of the press, huh!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Listen, Walter --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
You -- you --
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
No!
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Say, could I meet him?
No kidding?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What did you do with her?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
It'll be Heaven!
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
They can't do that to me!
I think it is.
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
You said it!
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Point the gun at me!
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Hold her, boys!
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
If there was any way out...
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Just -- one -- second!
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Go on -- shoot me!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
You'll take fifty and like it!
All right, Judge.
Who is it?
I'll go right after it.
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
No -- what?
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Isn't that her picture?
I won't, Earl. 
Well, maybe you think I could!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
Get the Governor on the phone!
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
You can't bribe me!
What's he want?
I know.
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
Yes, she did, didn't she?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
They're not.
Say them.
I only know one.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Won't they have maps?
Pauline.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
They've got the real thing outside.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Kiss me Hardy.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Propaganda. We've been had.
They'd gone.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
You joined up.
Jam.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
You taste it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
After this dance.
Half the time he's bluffing.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
No, I won't.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Up to six weeks, I think.
Play something, Grace.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
I know you mean well.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
What?
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Couple more miles up this road.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
What?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Fucking great.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Great story Goober, how much?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I don't.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Yeah.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Hell yeah.
I don't know.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Tasted pretty good.
Yeah, showtime for what?
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Quiet.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Hmmmmm.
What?
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Tickets for what?
I don't want to see that.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
So.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Recover any bodies?
Yep, I found something.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Huh?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, just a minute.
Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
Right.
Yes, sir.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
What.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
That must be him.
We found one.
And?
And think about what you've done.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Like father, like son.
Oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
Is everything fine?
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
You are sweet.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Not in front of the boy.
Very well.
Stop. Get away.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
Urgh.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
I've got some things to tell you.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
What?
Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Please. I look a mess.
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
But I like being human now.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Ouch. Yeah?
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
My brother is discreet.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Rose, please go away.
Oh, Rosie.
Oh, Rosie.
Shut up, you.
As do I.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
My God! The fork! The fork!
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'll be out in a minute.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
I don't think so.  Why?
Yes, darling.
A deer?
He looks perfectly fine.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
That's great.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
That was wonderful!
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila...
Ugnh.
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Okay. That's fair.
Even better.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
For whom and for what?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
That's the way it's done.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
Deal the cards.
Cut.
Only when I work.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Pool.
You being cute?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
I told you. I got drunk.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Why?
For who?
For me.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Thinking about what?
How good is he?
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
You hustlin' me?
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
You name it, we shoot it.
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
I don't want it.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Fast and loose, man.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
I asked around.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
What time?
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Yeah, sure has.
Hi.
How much are you ahead?
Try me.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yes.
Fair.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
What do you do on the other days?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
No.
Fifth of scotch?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Give me a drag.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
What's this supposed to mean?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
You watch me.
That is not now, human!
With them?
Yes.
We move.  Place to place.
My wife.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Humans.
Who?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Virginia...?
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Is the hill ours too?
Because the sky is so clear out here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
Was there anything over the hill?
Better now, son?
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
George, you're acting very strangely.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
I know a way.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
Let's try.
I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
I take it you've heard.
A toast to the end of the world.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
Love was never our problem.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Can you believe this?
Not really...
Checkmate.
Dad, don't start.
Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
Can't this thing go any faster?
They don't know this.
College nickname.
You can do that?
Moishe, please, don't talk.
This I can see.
A cold? Of course.
Just getting a feel for her.
I can't shake her free.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Really? You don't mind?
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Butt-munch.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
You sure?
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Air... water... your "sun."
Here... now.
And before here?
Many worlds...
Peace? No peace.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
You've got it!
All my life!
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
It looks like a converted church.
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
That was our assessment as well.
Where did this come from?
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Lower me down.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
You do.
All I have to do is scream.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Out!
I came to get you! What do you think?
Good point.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
He was actually there? You saw him?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Well, uh...
Look, can we discuss this later?
Will you take it easy!
Don't worry. He won't.
How did you she was a Nazi?
So did I.
Try and burn through the ropes.
What?
Dad!
Oh.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Booby traps?
Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
Good.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
When?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
This could be close.
You call this archaeology?
Get out of there, Dad!
After you, Junior.
Who are you?
Come on -- come on!
But, Indy --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
There are no stories anymore.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Why they glow like that?
Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.
Behind you!
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Oh yeah?
What do you mean -- how?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Keep stroking it!
I know the feeling...
What does the writing say?
Just try and control yourself.
No -- real food.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Go!
What above the curves?!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
Al ???!!!
Al.
Yes.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
What street?
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Shut up!
My place, can't you see?
That a new Datsun?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Are you crazy?
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
You're not crazy.
Yeah.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Oh...Gooood!
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Why? AL  You know too much.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
The man.
Good. Get to a phone.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
We get on which plane?
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Oh yeah, to what?
The beach?
Just get there.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Where are you going? Wait!
Are you screwing with any nerves?
You're out of shape.
How should I know?
Where are you staying?
What?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Rene...
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Yeah. I did it.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
The beautiful one.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Are you serious?
Killer!
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
What am I supposed to do?
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
It wasn't like that.
Why don't you get out of my face.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka?
Where are you going?
What do I do?
I told you, I have a feeling...
...imagine a better grape for the region.
I don't trust her.
I was afraid of that.
Well...?
And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Keep thinking.
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
Oh no!
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
The best part. She'll love it.
Don't give her your name.
Don't worry.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
Bit expensive, sir.
We met on the beach.
I have a new client.
Enough ROmance.
Do what?
Right.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Oh.
I will?
Oh yeah, thanks...
I don't know Who.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
Sir?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Nothing.
What?
No. No one to speak of.
Blake?
Haven't seen you around.
Do what?
Without what?
Why?
...and sort of...disinterest.
You talk to yourself.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
Is that Ryuji?
That depends...
Why'd you run off?
What did you tell them?
Why did they leave?
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Who did?
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
This business is over.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
One chip?
How do you know you can trust me?
Oh sure.
Ryuji and Gruner.
And you?
We figure out if it's in here.
What?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
You can say that again. What do we do?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Can't you do something?
I'll come back for you.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
You're gonna laugh.
Her?
I knew it. I told him.
It wasn't me. It was him.
But you did it. It was you.
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
I don't know.
It will be fine. You have another.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
It will.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
You got a deal. 
We gotta hook up.
I'll be there.
What? Forget it.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
How about you?
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
I'm afraid you are.
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
What about you, you got a crew already?
Are you sure?
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Come again?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Catch you later.
Call me back in ten.
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
Thomas Sandefur...
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Yes... Jeffrey.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
"60 Minutes"?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
Hello? Yeah...
They're killing the Wigand interview...
Jeffrey...
Who is this?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Yeah.
Hardly new news.
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
Good.
Lowell!
I disappeared on you?
I think it was a disgrace.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Yeah... Thank you.
What I've seen... I've liked.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
It's obvious, isn't it?
You charge by the hour?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
No.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
They do this with impunity!
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
Yeah, great.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
What?!
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
You try and have a good time.
Hello, can you hear me now?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
I can't say that!
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Right.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
He --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Here. Got pictures.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
What part?
Who's the pigeon?
Excuse me?
Is that... one person?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
What the hell is Botox?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Got any symptoms?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Is she Asian?
You have the pre-nup?
Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!
So, that's good, right?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Did you see the tape?
Why would you be here?
I told you. I was hungry.
I know you do.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Well, don't look at mine!
And you've always loved him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
So I hear. Is that all?
No, that's not all.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
From a -- girlfriend.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
She never particularly cared for me.
I want... I want to...
Huh?
Did you just propose to me?
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
I have a watch.
Good.  Are those foods?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Miles.
Hello Marylin.
I don't believe you have "things."
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's blackmail.
You do? You do love me?
Marylin!
It's not something I wanted either.
Murder?
Murder!
I thought so.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Marylin?
Marylin.
You have some?
Jesus.
You used his credit card.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
Of Massey Myerson?
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
I want to be exposed.
But you're going through with it?
So what?
I guess.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
Thank you.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
HA!
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Mother?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Three is not Farrow.
Who's Rex's guy?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
The reward.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
South America.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Stunt?
On the road.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Who is he?
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Are you going to see him?
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Lower the boats!
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
We've done that already.
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
But the lady says
Thanks.
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Ohthe papers
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
Driver!
Are you talking to me?
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What happened?
I don't want it reported!
Yes.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
I didn't ask for your advice. 
That's none of your business.
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Where is the shower?
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
You weren't so bad yourself.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
To New York?
Yeah.
Okay. Hang on to these.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
Of course it is.
Not a one.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Well, take them off.
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
wasbut
Carrots.
What if nobody stops for us?
You think it's simple, huh?
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
You! Don't make me laugh.
What about money?
That's swell!
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Nope.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter
Same to you.
Not interested. 
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Husband?
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
SorryI didn't mean to
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Wait a minute, GordonI
Get out!
Don't "Joe" me.
Huh?
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Listen, Palyou've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Oh!!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah.
Yes, Ma.
What's the idea?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
That's right.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Orange, New Jersey.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Did he pay?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
No, I'm not...
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
I did.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
And Shaw?
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
I want the truth.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.  Never heard of him.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Please answer the question.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I don't think so, Jim...
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Take a look across the street.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
Who?
Allen Dulles?
They're gonna love you, chief.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Are they?  Why would they?
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
That's all you've had all this time?
That sounds fun.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Three years.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
What?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
And you didn't tell the Police?
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to make a deal.
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Suspicion of what?
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
What's in it?
That's my diet shit.
Take your time.
Fine.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
But you're not going to stop her?
Okay.
Who do you think I am?
Is it dark?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Shit.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
He told me last night.
What?... What'd you do?
Why?
It's different with men.
Bigger?
Catching a movie.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I called you last night.
I see.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
You do that?
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
In a dress.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
It's not that simple.
Tell him you want to see him?
Why?
What do you tell Nicolet?
I never lied to you.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
Do you live together?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Yeah?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
You never asked me if I did or not.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
I never have. It's not my money.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
What did you do after that?
So what happens now?
What about me?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
I knew it.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Go sit over in that chair.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
Talk to you tomorrow.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
I can do that.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I was there, I saw her do it.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
What does she think she's gettin?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
Two months shy of four years.
It's a diet thing?
Fourteen.
No.
You been to Japan?
About five years ago.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
That sounds like a problem.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He went to meet that stewardess.
And your point is?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
Whatcha watchin'?
The moon -- I dunno
I'm in my underwear.
What did he do?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
I shot her.
You couldn't just hit her?
Uh-huh.
So you're sure she's dead.
In the chest and stomach.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
What?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
You gonna tell me who it was?
Max Cherry.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
I think I do. Is that good enough?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Ten thousand sounds high.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
You think you could do that?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Yes.
I can see that. Why?
What?
What does she do for you?
Was she?
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
I thought you might be asleep.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
How'd you find me?
How the fuck did he find me?
Well, give it to me then.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
No.
Yes.
You know it's for you.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
It's all been a dream.
No! Oh God.
What do you want?
Well, how do I look?
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Hey, wait!
Now what?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
Why do you say that?
No. Not really ...
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
... I've seen them, too.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
A bit.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
What?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
I need your insight, your intuition.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
I don't want to know.
She was good in bed, though.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Yeah, but for what?
What's in here?
Why you left.
Gabe.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
They weren't human!
Where?
Hey, I'm here.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
He did? When?
While you were in the shower.
He said you didn't have one.
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Me neither.
What's gotten into you?
Stick with me, kid.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
You know who I am.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
If you're lucky.
Help me!
For what? For seeking the truth?
He'll never make it.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
That black car?
You in trouble?
I don't know what to do.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Oh God. I know. I know.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
The army?
Died?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
He doesn't like it.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Pour it in.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Yes it does.
Alright, asshole.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
What do you mean, not enough time?
We're not leaving Crutch!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
He came for me, I had to run!
Where'd you get the gun?
The hull's imploding!
What are you gonna do, tell me?
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
Not a chance.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Negative.
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
We have to get off this ship.
I hope so.
No you don't!
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Not so bad.
You?
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Did you like it?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
She broke my fucking nose!
She needs a little time.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
You lost the charge?
He was chasing me!
NO!
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Small brains make your balls itch?
Let's just get out of here.
You prefer an apple?
You need to get laid!
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Am I in there?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Oh, alright.
I love you.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Nanotechnology.
I didn't say he was alive.
4You're not going anywhere.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
What have I done?! Idiots.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Sure but what good will that do?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Sure, Dad.
And incidental damages, if any...
Try some of this. I made it myself.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
I never hear the whistle.
Older, sillier.
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
Maybe we can save August...
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You're leaving?
Yep.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Down here, Hooper!
Fasten the pole.
I think I can top that, Mister...
No way! He can't!
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
I'm pregnant.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Okay, cool.
Well, I do.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
I still have your virginity!
Yeah. That was me.
What, you mean as friends?
I try really hard, actually...
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Oh, go fly a kite.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Yeah.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
When was this, like '96?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Commercials.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Why? What the big deal?
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Cute?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
You do?
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
But you're old!
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Vanessa, right?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
I went to the doctor today.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Nothing.
Congrats.
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Or...
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Hot!
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Keith's hot.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
I want to be a mommy so badly!
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
And I disagree.
Hm.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
He whips you?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Hold still.
Adele... are you serious?
Yeah.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Almost.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
I heard that.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Best kind.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Dahlia, no.
You wanna hear mine?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Ha.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
Funny, very funny.
Lighten up...
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Up yours.
I heard that.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Fuck!
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
I don't know.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
Wasn't my fault...
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
17.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
You fucked it?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
How?
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
You think?
Probably.
Den less go Joe.
Yeah.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Yeah.
Bet.
Why I do what?
So.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Hold up man.
Yeah. Do it again.
What?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Right now?
At the block party?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
But I'm scared Telly.
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
Bang up stuff.
No, Fidget, I...
Yeah.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Why?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
I guess so.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Am I getting warm?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Thanks.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
You still mad at him?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
Passion...
Boom!!! Boom!!!
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I gotta find him.
Yeah?
Whah?
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Making love is like.
Yeah.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
You think so?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Shh.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Nah.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's grandmother style.
To come?
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yeah.
What kind of problem?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
What?
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
No, I need the original note.
Homesearchers.
I'm positive.
You're a lying bastard!
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
It's a voice modulator.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Who is this?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Why not?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
Not really.
I'm just trying to play the game.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
Then call them!
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
You sonofabitch!
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
By that time the game will be over.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
The pipes.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Come here.
Boys.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
That has nothing to do with it.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
What about prints?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
But we heard him.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
I went out.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Is it serious?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
What are they, please?
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
When I was very young.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
It is.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Getting too hot in here for you?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
It wasn't intentional.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Do you?
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
And you?
I'm not playing a game now.
What is this?
Does anyone?
Then show me who you are.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
Call room service.
What do you want on it?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Then why are you backing up?
For emphasis?
Can I come in?
It's not that easy.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Frank told me.
Of course not.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
I'm not nervous.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
We're almost married.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I knew you would come.
Turold's son was to marry her.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
I have no extraordinary powers.
There is no other way.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
I will find her!
<u>Why</u>?
Yes.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Can she be forced?
She can see the Beast!
Use your sword.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
I forbid you!
We must enter the swamp.
What will happen?
I don't think that.
Yes.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
I cannot.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
Staying alive.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
You will follow me.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Not sleepy, either?
We must try to get horses.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
And mine goes with you.
I don't think it's working.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
Hush!
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
Yes.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A match for your son, I think.
Yes. We lost five.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
With an old voice?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
She had another name once.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
It is no trickery.
Knowledge.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...Not at all.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Well, I don't need them...
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Good.
How can you say it?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Yes, yes...
Too heavy.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
What?
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
I don't know... Five minutes.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
...I got lost, Mister.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh? Why?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
...And how much is it?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Messina.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Where?
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
I don't accept that.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
Maybe later.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
What?
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
There was no card.
You don't think I love you?
No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
You're talking to me?
You like to take walks?
You've just decided, is that right?
Pacifica, California.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Pacifica, California.
I see.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Most certainly.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You tell stories?
Perhaps there's another route?
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Umm, Coalville Utah.
It has to be a full character's name.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Yes.
Tomorrow.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
You're amazing.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Saluting.
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Steph.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Someone should be with you.
Good morning.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
What do you mean?
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Sparkling apple cider?
You were going to get my door.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
You OK out there?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Of course.
No?
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
With an old friend.
No.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
I'll take that as a no.
Who?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
No.
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
No. I was in the shower.
I guess.
About the alibi --
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Definitely! I love him!
No.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
You guys are so sweet!
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Thank you. I love you, too.
So?
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Thanks again for your help!
I wasn't gonna --
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Why?
And you know this for a fact?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
You're serious?
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
So Friday at eight?
Are you sure?
Absolutely!
I got bangs!
Really --
Maybe she found him like that.
I guess it'll have to...
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
You go where?
What, like it's that hard?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Thank you. Having fun?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Well, yeah, but --
Are you serious?
Where?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Cunnilingus?
Pull up next to him!
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
We go out, smash 'em now?
You go to lady now?
But I'm hideous!
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
And, now?
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
To be sure.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
I fear she's lost.
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
Careful, lad.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Aye!  That too.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Certainly understandable.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
Willful creature, that one...
Nay.  This time we strike first!
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
The chill is worse this night.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Why not mine the damned walls?
That's it!
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
The wound is mortal.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Sunlight.
He'll not escape me.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Where?
I'll try.
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Sorry.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
But you did... you did!
Unicorn?
A gentleman would offer water.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
Be patient.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
My father and the Baron.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Tis the truth.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Only what's right...
You've freed me, Jack...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Lili... I love you!
Everywhere!  Ow!
I can't see a thing.
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
She's dead!
I don't believe you.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Only that?
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
The Black Baron, you say?
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
What are you doing?
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
I wanna be with you today.
Who are you?
What's wrong?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
He seems lonely.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
What did you think it would be?
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
Why are you so uptight?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
What are you talking about?
I'm not gay.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
He's got a standing invitation.
He's at work while I'm here.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
A violation?
A sink?
I flushed it down the toilet.
If that's what it takes.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Not a shower.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
I'll be around to check up on you.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You don't have a choice.
No you don't.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I don't know.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You can't make me do a thing.
Don't.  I don't want it.
Hi, Mom.
What I'm not.
He's got nothing to do with me.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything.
Here.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I need you to do me a favor.
God, you look like crap, George.
Where have you been for a week?!
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you can't call me while you think?
Why would they tow your truck?
Why call me?
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Money?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
When's school over?
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Finished or unfinished?
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
My stupid back.
I can hire workers to help me.
You've never said that before.
It's not my back that's killing me.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
No.
Nothing.
I wasn't sure.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
I could use the money.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Sooner than the Fall.
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I know.
What are you doing home?
I'll be in the bedroom.
Either do you.
Do you like red?
Why?
I guess I could teach you some things.
Can you stay for dinner?
Yeah.
Dad said it first.
I just thought it would be nice.
That's my girl.
He's a big one.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
I'm talking about a haircut.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
No, but...
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
She got married last month.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
Here!
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
He looks like he can take care of himself.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
That's some long green.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Oooh...
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
You're soft.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Guess we better get going, huh?
You lost all our money in a card game?
He's dead.
Winston. His name's Winston.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
He does it all by himself.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
I'm sure it don't.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
I don't know. Who do you want?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Whatever.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
Well, if that's the way it is...
That's the way it is.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
It's too late for plans.
Why the hell not?
Gimme that damn thing.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm all right.
'Preciate it. Claude.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
How about some steak sauce?
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
Movin' it out, boss.
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
It'll be too late.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Jenny?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Me? Willie Long.
That's a long story...
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
You found him.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Understood.
Please, get out of my mind!
And he's dead serious.
It's just such a slap in the face.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Don't do it!
Urr... uggg... errr...
Angels don't get any older, son.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
That pain is hunger.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Release the evil?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
You did it for Namath.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Definitely.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
Son, just do your best.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Beast.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
Oh, would you grow up.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
That way.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
See ya, fellas.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Yes, great movie...
You smell like coconuts.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
"Octopus people?"
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Good. I was concerned.
Are you dead?
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
That was Cassius!
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
No.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
A black guy?
If it's Cassius, yes.
I feel sorry for you, boy!
All right -- what are you?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Your own work?
Just the face.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Well... you can't have them all.
I'm in my party mood.
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
Where do you live, Mary?
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
You know.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
Of course --
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
How will they know we're coming?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
For us.
And yours.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
Then the answer's yes...
It could be...
We can't. We're going back.
Things change!
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Is it inside the city?
At least it's over...
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
All right.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
I'm sorry.
Oh my... I'll try.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
They're comin' with us.
Sure, I'm okay.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Or not so recently?
Yeah... Laurent.
Ours, Ed.
What's that, Ed?
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Hi.
Okay...
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
So what do we do?
What's he do?
Yeah.
How'd it happen, Alice?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Why are ya goin' so early?
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Yes, I believe so.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Sit down.
Yes.
Where is he now?
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
What about yesterday?
Pete, what happened to you?
No... I don't. Why?
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
No.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
That's why I married you.
A videotape.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I wish I knew.
Why would anyone do something like this?
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
At sixty?
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
What'd I tell ya.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Who is this?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
No. No, I don't.
What?
Yeah?...
Sheila?!
Come on... get in.
I do like you, Sheila.
I was?
Yeah.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
A what?
Well, what do you know about that!
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Look here
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
Yes.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Yes!
Do you think they're cannibals?
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
I'm thinking.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
The police?
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
I'll say.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Why, you look beautiful.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
They were.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Who?
Well, is it?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Yes, charming.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Suppose she should leave it?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Oh, I'm so glad.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Pardon me
As far away as I ever want to be.
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
Sondra Bizet.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Yes.
Hello? Colonel?
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants  and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
See that spot?
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Yes.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
What if he refuses?
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
I'd love it!
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
Go? Where?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Cowan--
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
No. just peace on Earth.
And if I say yes?
All the time, sir.
Kay, I'm sorry...
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
Don't worry about it.
INS, Washington.  Special services.
What?
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Let's check am out.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
And what's this ... ?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
I'd double it and add 20.
Kay!?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
Actually... I don't know.
Maybe you need a closer look.
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
It's... coming.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Scientific American?  Really?
Wait-- listen--
Fine.  Good.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
She's still alive?
Then who was he?
Anne Lively...
I know... I do, too...
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Yes, you did.
How do I find the --
Here --
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
... Graveyard shift.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Don't apologize, John.
I understand.  Sir.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
What?
In the middle of the night?
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
You can't run --
No doubt.
Uh, sir...
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Did Marks close the front door?!
Go back to work.  All of you.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Because it was going to fall.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
She's a precog?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
So?
Come on!
All right, I'll try...
Good-bye, Dad...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
He's alive?
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Who made you do this?
I'm a little dizzy...
I'm... not... a... killer.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
You're talking about the precogs...
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
So you won't help me?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
I believe in that system...
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You're insane or you think I am.
Which one is that?
The female.
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
We know why John was tagged.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
This murder is happening at two different times.
How?
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
None.  This was arranged.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
I know who you are.
Yes.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
But there's still the other two.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Good luck.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
When served warm --
I can take you down there.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Is it the good room?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
No.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
We used to take baths together.
Come on. Let's go.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
No more.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
It's daytime.
Uncle Bobby?
I don't know.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Yeah? You sure?
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
I want you to quit.
I'll support you.
What'd you say?
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Your dance is over.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Draw.
You driving her?
Yeah.
She'll be out in a minute.
What's his name?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Quick drop. In and out.
That it?
You bet the ponies?
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
I don't understand.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
Yeah.
What is it?
You want --
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Good morning.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Where's the drop?
Bobby.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Understand me?
It's important.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
What about it?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
Then why do you try to get in?
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Bullshit...
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
You wanna go right now?
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
I like it.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
To keep?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Oh really. Why's that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Well, I don't want to walk.
So they said more than the address.
What the fuck do you...
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah. What vibe?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
Back in.
You got that right.
She was jonesing for me.
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
You want us strapped, don't you?
Did you hear what he just said?
I'm pretty sure we do.
Float me a hundred bucks.
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty five.
You did?
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
So what do we do?
Three and a half hours?
Easy...
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Kinda. Yeah.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Yeah. I want it.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
The line's over there.
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
What?
S'up.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
How much is what?
Where do you live?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
You strapped?
It means you got a gun?
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
You really in trouble?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Does anyone want another?
Coke?
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Word.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.
What?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Goodbye.
We're square.
Yes, sir.
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
And where might that be?
Heard where?
Why?
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
Solid, daddy.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
You never had it.
I'm wearing, Archie.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
What you say?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
Don't con me.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
What the hell for, man?
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
No, Brother Minister.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
You have enough worries of your own.
How old are you, Betty?
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
I love you.
I'll be away a lot.
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
What do you want me to do?
You have to sleep for three.
Dear heart, where are you?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
Let's get out of this cold.
Let some of us come down there.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
Let me do it then.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
I ain't stupid.
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
I do know I love you.
Murder.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
500.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Well, all reet, then.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Eat lead, coppers.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
Eddie, let's see that blotter.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Am I a suspect?
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
What do you want?
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
I'm not... easy.
[Why?]
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
I show, you give me the information?
Where?
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Where do I find him?]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[Lucky how?]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
How does it affect you?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
I came to visit you.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Pinta...
The United States.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
I'm a bargain.
Time will tell.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Oh...
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
No.
My ankle.
Yes.
You need to practice.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
Are you afraid of me?
Could I stop you?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You got that right.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
No.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Because...  I was already dead.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
What was her name?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
For a year?
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
When?
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Our daughter.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
What? Who?
Creasy.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
That's ridiculous.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Two tourists who never went home.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'll call her up.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
Where?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Where you going?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
I came to see you. How you feel?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
That's nice.
It's her baby too, you know.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Marty...
Please...
Nothing.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Goodnight.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
No, I'm not kidding.
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
About eight o'clock.
Sure. This girl said...
You gonna die without a son.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
I don't know. I don't think so.
She didn't look Italian to me.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hiya, Ralph...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Hello, Thomas.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Okay.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Where?
He said it for us all, Walt.
Epidural hematoma?
There's only one way.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Same general idea.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Sixteen times.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
But what about Major Houlihan?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
An eternal damnation.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
What's the age of consent in this country?
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
I don't get it.
What do we do?
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
All of them?
That's right. We work well together.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You're an attractive man.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Same here.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
You're leaving tomorrow?
You're on his side all of the sudden?
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Why would he do that?
Excuse me, Sergeant.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
What's the story?
What's wrong with him?
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
Yes, sir?
Sir?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
Nice.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Against what?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Me?
Uh-huh.
No.
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, butthere you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
The Websters!
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
Oh!
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
What John Doe?
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Plus a bonus.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I wish he had a family, though.
Oh.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Awwwww!
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Thank you.
I ain't seen him for a week.
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Yeah, a little.
Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
What?
Look!
All right. You're walking alongnot a nickel in your jeansfree as the windnobody bothers youhundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessshoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
A what?
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Yeh.
John Doe Club?
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Yeah, you bet!
Sure.
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
No.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
What difference does that make?
Flowers.
Did you want to see her about something important?
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Shh!
No, sir.
SWAT wants to go in.
Dinner's on you.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
I'll take half of your action.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Huh?
Am I gettin' the car?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Earl.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
For now that's all.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
If you say so.
I know.
Recruited you from where?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You'd never been out of New York?
How did you like Toronto?
I'm not sure.
We could fill it with water.
I don't gamble.
We see each other every couple of months.
Every couple of months, huh?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Where did you hear that?
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I think so.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Why?
Okay, stop.
You're a compulsive gambler?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Fine.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
We won.
About six years. My partner took me.
Occasionally you lose.
And doing a very good job of it.
Damnit!
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
And what if you can't live with it?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Is the hostage injured?
You worship yourself.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
It's okay. We broke up.
Hmm?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
Who's running it?
What do you want?
I need to take back what's mine.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
To live forever.
Someone who believes in miracles.
Guests?
Wake up?!
No.
Yes.
In a computer program.
Yes.
One would assume so.
Unfinished business.
-- He will.
How long?
At least a day.
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
And you weren't involved.
Where?
Insurance.
Some things never change, do they?
-- The inside?
Realize?
Not you.  A copy.
There was no other choice.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Activated.
-- Standard.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Ah... sure.
It will not harm you.
I've never been this sore in my life.
What's a Triac?
About twenty seconds in your time.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
Release the power with the power.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
We could smell it's breath.
A stellar idea, Skull.
... A falcon?
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
How about Major Moron?
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Quack like a'duck!
What do you mean "basically"?
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
What's going on?!
But I've never served a day.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Tell me about it.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Whatever you say, Boss.
Why should I be?
Life knocked me back.
And now you have everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I guess I am. Just a little.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Who hired the bastard?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
Long as Charlie says.
That ain't what your mama said.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
No. They envy you.
No. I'm here with you.
I must be going.
I'm already late.
I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
I needed to see you again.
Same here.
You're sure?
You got something to hide?
London?
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
I'll handle the Boss.
How soon can we pull this off?
I told you twenty!
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
What's your problem?
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Never threaten me, Boss.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Not if they all die at once.
The kid just called me stupid.
Not stupid. Fat.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Not a lot ta know.
Don, I'd be honored.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
You get fifteen percent.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
I'll take care of the Boss.
I don't fuck my partners.
They do what I tell 'em.
Masseria's been after me too.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
We can operate around these guys.
And what do you want out of this?
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Spare us.
Jesus.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Luciano is dead?
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Yeah...before your time.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I didn't say anything.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Death! Thank you!
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Less.
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
YOU SET ME UP!!
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
He called me "Doc."
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Who?
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
The ring...
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
How am I gonna get past the guards?
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
We like to think so, yeah.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
You don't like where I live?
Uh-huh?
... What are they all doing there?
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
What pictures?
Mother!
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
What happened?
... Manly?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
Yeah.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Forty-five all total.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
You've never *seen* this contract.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Looks like it, but--
It couldn't be.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
Let's send out a pigeon!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
Who?
That's taking place outside now.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Waiter!
Shut up, Diz.
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Tonight?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Is the wind tired out there?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Have *you*?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Okay--I mean--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
No--not offhand--
You said it!
You know, we're getting married.
Take me home, Diz.
He's a house-afire!
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
That infernal phone!
What is it?
Great saints!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
No wonder--without your dinner.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
*You won't?*
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Ma! Hold him!
Is *what* getting me down?
Himself!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
I beg your pardon?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
For a question!
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Mr. President--
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
What?
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Office of--Senator Smith?
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
You *couldn't*?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
And with your help--
A *day*!
Committee.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
*This* is.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Pardon?
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Yes, yes--
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be--
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Great.
Already? All these letters?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
I'm not.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Where do we go from here?
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Well--I--
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
How's that, buddy?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Swell!
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
What do you mean? What's going on?
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
That's dynamite, Joe!
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Okay. See you here.
No?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
That's right.
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Yeah?  And what else?
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Yes--
What are you talking about? What difference--?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
He did it.
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
What do you think?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
You can't say *that* to--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
It's crucifying him--!
But--if he *does*, Joe--
He was a seven-months baby.
Uh-huh.
Why not?
No!
Yes!
Yes!
NO!!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
I enjoy it.
Yes.
Yeah, let's.
Huh?
Gosh! What do you know about that!
You have?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Thank you.
Are you? When?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Have lunch.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Shhh!
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
Fourteen carat?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
This is outrageous!
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Mr. Cedar!
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
What for?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
No, thanks.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
What're you talking about?
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Shut up!
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Is Mary home?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I did what!
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Hmm?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
One hundred books?
Mr. Cook.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
A friend?
I'm fine.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
My approach?
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Why not?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Mr. Gilroy --
Nope.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
You've done well.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
What?
That's a lot of people all at once.
What are they?
You do?
Doc.  Ainge...
It's a pretty piece of land.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
...And?
Okay.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
What do you mean?
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
Hmm.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
We'll work it out.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Something's bothering her.
Really? What would it take?
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
That's what I like.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
What was that?
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
What?
What is your name?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Weekly or monthly?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
It's called pro bono.
It's my bit for the community.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
True. Should we stop them?
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
No again?
How are you?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Is that the question?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
It matters to me.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
But look at me now...
Things got a lot worse.
You and Candy...?
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
I'm honored.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Yep.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Relax, I got him.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
You shall see.
What does he want the book for?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Intestines.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
You will not believe it.
Try me.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
I am an English woman.
Two hundred pounds.
Fifty percent.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No.
I just decked your brother
Every damn day.
Really want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Are you sure?
The things that get you excited.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
Because that's my name.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
That bad huh?
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
You lied to me!
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Still...
Oh.
Um, well, you see...
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Got it.
I knew you'd know.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
The Disco Boys.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
I was eight.
I can't.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
But in fact... you'd found it.
I thought you'd never ask.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Why bother?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Frankenstein!
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Who?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Not tonight. 
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
It's home.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
I just want to be a superhero.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Yes.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
Yeah.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
See ya tomorrow.
Wait!... Look!
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
He hasn't stolen it yet.
I use it... to fight evil.
It is?
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Sorry.
Be a Mohican. 
Whatever our name is.
Right.
Proceed.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
And, what a delightful idea!
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
What do you mean?
I did, sir.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Any cannon?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
It is a terrible shock.
Bertrand, sire.
Come back in an hour.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Yes, I am.
Bastia -- and you?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
When you eat him, may I have some?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
That is correct.
And he sent you to me?
Does your mother know you have come?
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Thank you.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Only Lisette?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
Are you trying to insult me?
When is she supposed to return?
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were you in love with any of them?
No.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
I will never forgive you.
I know what you're doing in there.
Certainly.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
What?
You couldn't face telling me what?
How do you know?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Oh, then you are...
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
And where do you place Alexander?
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Send him in.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Well, let me in.
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Suga!
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
You know what he mean, dude.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Nobody!
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
What you mean, so?
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
I don't.
Ain't no windows in here.
I don't know yet.
What's the B-G's?
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Make sure.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Well bring yo' ass on...
All damn.
Have you seen Day-Day?
Yeah, pops!
Smokin' what?
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
I don't have no damn cover.
Negative...they vamped.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
Bite his ear!
20 minutes?
I don't know.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
Keep pushing.
I can't feel my legs no more.
I don't know.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I got my mase.
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
It's an important speech.
What happened here?
You sent my assistant on an errand.
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
What?
Sorry.
I...
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
That's...a comfort to hear.
No.
What?
What the hell are you saying?
For what?
For not believing you.
Same to you.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
I'd like to know what...
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
Where did you get these? Who are you?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
You...
I kill her - and you kill me.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
No, please...
Don't you threaten me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
How did you see us kiss?
Right.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
All right.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
What are you supposed to do?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Irene is going to help.
I don't know.
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
I think this is worth a dollar.
Gimme a dollar.
Fuck you!
I've got something for you.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
How's your sister Pearl?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
She went.
Yes! Yes!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
So you ain't with the State no more?
Walt!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
All to pieces!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
Come on!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Pearl dotes on him.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
The money, Icey.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
You better not sing that song.
Sshhh...
Hm?
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
No, that's just it. No.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Ssh...
She talks to herself.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
He ain't my Dad.
I'll make coffee.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Nothin'!
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Yes. Yes.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
You could save him, little bird.
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
All right.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Why, pray tell?
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Pearl and John.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Them kids is yours?
Where's your Missus?
Where's she at?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
The Lord will provide.
None of your business, Madam.
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
When did I ever?
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
He never asked me for nothin'.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Pearl and John.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
No.
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
Who?
The killer.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Okay. Hi, dad.
What?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
'Anything funny' like what?
Like Rod Lane?
I will.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Nancy?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
We should get her out of here...
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
What are you serving?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I have nothing to hide.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
Evening gown?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
I don't want to go to Siberia.
Right now it's on the balcony.
What is it?
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Why should you be afraid?
I think I need my glasses.
I must be stern with you.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
That's all right.
Eight forty-two, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
That's perfect!
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
What is it, my boy?
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
While you eat, you look at the view.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
But you can't...
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Comrade.
Two thousand francs.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Right away... instantly!
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
Au revoir.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Don't hold that against me... please!
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
You believe in our cause?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Why should I take a chance?
Gladly.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Thank you.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Go ahead.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
Wounded? How?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
No, that was restful. Again.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
As a representative of Moscow...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
I didn't follow you.
What are you after?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Why?
At what?
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Anything, Ninotchka.
I promise... I swear.
Did you make any change in this room?
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Shhh! Shhh!
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
All right.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Please.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
Did you win?
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You can't imagine.
That bad?  Old or young?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Am I interrupting?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
No thanks, Swana.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
What?
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
I must insist that you leave.
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
Unfortunately.
Go on.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
What do you want?
Yes, it does.
How do you do, my friend.
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
So ... let's go ...
He told me to take you to his conference room.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
So you tell Mitchell ...
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
He wants money.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
I thought the gloves were off.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Cox!  Fire him.
So?
And if I stay?
Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Yes, you approved it, sir.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
"National Priority."
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
How is this national security?
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
No!
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
You never told him?
Money.  Follow the money.
Run 'em over.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
It's the parents' fault really.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
What?
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Let him finish, Bob.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Yes ...
What?
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
So President Kennedy thought.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
No.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
You should ask Bobby.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Kissinger?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
She's quite pretty.
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
You don't think he was a hero?
Did you cry when he died?
Yes.
Free, if you're the president.
How about Kissinger along with him?
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
... but it was all we had.
You're shittin' me.
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Yes, I understand that.
Of them.
Fire him.
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It's over, Dick.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Are you serious?
You don't have to go.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
This.  Above all.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country.  These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
Thank you.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Someday, Dick.
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
How you been, Ellis?
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
'Predate it.
How fresh is this coffee?
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
How come're you doin that?
Yes I do.
You're discouraged.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
He's real all right.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
You ain't heard from him?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
The old boy shot by the highway?
You sure?
That's the boy.
I don't know...
Gun out and up.
So when was he here?
I'm ahead of you there.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
Yessir.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
I always am.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Not like that. Not like you say.
That'll work.
Yeah.
Goin' where?
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What makes you say that?
I know where the money is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
What's that.
I know where it's going to be.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Airport.
Sixty-nine cent.
I don't know. Will there?
With anything?
Generally around dark. At dark.
Sir?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
I could come back then.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
How's that?
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
No sir, it's unusual.
When did you last see him.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Okay.
How well do you know Chigurh.
What do you want to know?
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
You want to change rooms?
No, one forty-two.
Sugar?
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
No I don't have it.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
I got an overcoat on.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Anyway, so what?
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
Tell him what you told me.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
What about it?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, I was just... How you doing?
They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
...to see you.
I am?
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
The LeSabre!
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
I gotta go make dinner.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
We were engaged.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
You're late, Eric.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Of course.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Yes... maybe it was.
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What's so special about it?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
They're new to us...
That is a skill!
I don't know.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I'd slap his face.
Los Angeles, California.
That's horrible!
How did you know?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
I'll go to the Hospital.
Worse.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I married a car salesman.
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Doctor David Ravell.
Umm...
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
No, almost never.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
I... I don't know...
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Now, that's really stupid.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
You told me how to do it!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
I hope you're right...
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
I know that.
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
What the hell's the matter with you?
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Where? Where is she?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Oh, five years, give or take.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
...who doesn't?
You better believe it.
Can I have an evil twin?
I don't know, George...
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
Uh-huh.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
Did Chloe crack?
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Mr. Campbell?
Waitaminute -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
Gopher, Everett?
Do not seek the treasure!
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Four hundred, Delmar.
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Okay, Everett.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Oh, okay.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Powas p'suasion.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
No weddin'.
That's good, honey.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
So I borrowed it till I did know!
That don't make no sense!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Isn't it, uh...
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
But... but...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Blooey!
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
Yes, Sir.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Great.
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Great ass.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
I'm doing okay, sir.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Yes, sir!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Aw screw it...
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir!
No, sir!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Where are you from, boy?
Zack, don't!
What are you tired from?
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
Yeah.
Or we could do that yeah.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
What?
I do.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
And you turned him down??
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Not me.
Yeah? Why're you here?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Me, too.
My kinda group!
Forget it. Just get out of here.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I'm starving.
It sure was.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
No, they're for your mom.
Why'd he do it?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why?
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I bet you do!
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Yeah. All week long.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
I've seen better.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
Naw.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
No problem, but who's Susan?
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
You got an idea?
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Not that one.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
They're not supposed to be here!
They're not supposed to be here!
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Pure idiot.
Shit!
What about us?
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Oh, that phone call...
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
I said open the door.
Don't!
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
The furniture guy?
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
478...
People.  In the house.
PANIC ROOM!
It doesn't work?!
What if they get in here?
Yeah.
Nope.
Say fuck.
Give me a break.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Come on, come on...
Shhh...
Uh uh.
Stop it.
Why?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Huh uh.
Not an option.
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
What are doing with yours?.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
I got you.
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Yeah, it's me.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
You joining? My Brother..  My brother.
N... N...... Not... Oh.
Are you finished?
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
No sir he didn't.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
We're like policing the police.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
I don't know.
I'm down.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
They were empty...
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Brimmer.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
And who is we?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
If you got something to say, say it.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
Ain't no one seen him.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Late summer.
Congratulations.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
That would be nice.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
I expect to try.
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
The hell I do.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
You couldn't have known.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
Do you?
Lovely.
With a lace table cloth?
Colonel will do.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Prisoner exchange.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Are you going to meet with him?
And if I triumph, you triumph.
I understand, sir.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Yes.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
Oh?
Yes, sir.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
You don't hate him.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
It's Mister Marion.
I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
That's a damn long time...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Name five hundred.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
What are my orders?
When?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Goodbye, Harry.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Four, five miles.
But what about Thomas?
For what?
Yes, he does.
Earned.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Worse.
When?
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Well...I guess not.
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Yes.
Because you promised.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Not at all.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Allman Brothers.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Sure.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Ayuh.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Because it's right.
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
Well...a touch of the flu...
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Nope. He's your cat now.
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I'm sure.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Elizabeth goes free!
We got that part.  Anything else?
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
He didn't waste it.
Wait as long as you like.
Track you down and --
What're you suggesting?
The situation has changed.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Or you could surrender.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Commodore, you can't do that!
You're speaking up for him again?
What?
It would appear, so do you.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
If I had known --
-- then we never would have met.
You're in league with Barbossa!
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
The trees are taller.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
We're catching up!
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
I don't think that will be necessary.
We'll see about that.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
Good.
It's still against the law.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
That's not true.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
This way!
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
And no lies!
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
Still --
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
But --
Dr. Bright has escaped.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Nebbleman.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Then you still love me?
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
What I asked you earlier?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
The nanobot is gone.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
The trunk.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
Aaabout...?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Opportunity?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
Is that so?
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
The nanobot.
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
That was 'simple'?
Got it.
Three days ago it was.
No, why?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Yeah.  Old times.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
The nanobot... it's not here...
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
On the counter.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Yes.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
I guess they do.
You were looking for us?
It's a miracle.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
We lost him.
Don't worry, four eyes.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
No? Why not?
Certainly. Right over there.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
I poisoned him.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Oh, hello Mother!
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Thanks, I will.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Oh, is that so?
I'm afraid.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
With me you can always do business.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Right - for the first time this year.
Well - it's only April.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Not on my own beat, no.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Why not?
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
That's so.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Sure.
No!
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
You're my what?
Your valet, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Quite so. Quite.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
I bet.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
and that
Well!
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
It's the smoke.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Staring at us?
Hello, Stew.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Right.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
What could I be?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Good.
Traps shut!
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Holy jumping swordfish!
I suppose you know why I came?
Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
I beg your pardon.
Okay - you remember Joe
Sure.
Hello, Joe.
Why
Get out of here.
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?
Have you seen this? 
Yes - the worm!
The name is Smythe.
Yes, sir.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Yeah?
... Sex.
Ah.
What?
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
... It's a pretty short trip.
I think it looks nice.
Bud?
She's crying.
But you can't go out there.
Oh, George ...
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
No I'm not.
I don't want it to go away.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Lover's Lane!
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
Okay, that's IT!!!
That's not going to happen!
Oh, no thanks ...
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
No. Of course not.
Rain.
You're not allowed to lie.
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What is it?
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
Get lost!
YOU get lost!
I don't know.
Neither do I.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
To who?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
As a matter of fact he does.
What?
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
It's in your closet.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Well if I don't who will?
Really? It seems so fattening.
Not directly anyhow ...
Nothing.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
I told you. I'm like positive.
Honestly ... no.
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
What?
They just grow like that?
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
That's right.
What the hell's going on!
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
COME BACK!!!
Well c'mere, young fella.
I can't.
What?
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
I had nothing to do with that.
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
Oh no? Let me show you something!
I'm going to leave now.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Yeah ...
I understand.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Really?
Yeah.
Hi.
I'll never be able to do that.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
Well here I am.
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Yeah. 
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Yes, I'll be there.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
So you're coming tonight, right?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
So it's ok if I bring her.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Hello everyone.
Why?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Call me later.
Tell me why.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hi, is this Jack?
Where are you?
I'm in my bedroom.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Do you like porno movies?
Sure.
No.
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
Not very late.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Yeah.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
....what....?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
You lied to me?
It was cool last night.
I have to go.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
No.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Do you know them.
I think that'll be fine.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
No. Not at all. It's nice.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
Ok.
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
Yeah.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
So that was your pudding?
No I didn't say that.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Nothing.
Ok.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Yes? I'm trying.
Oh that's great.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Lena?
Yeah?
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
About six months ago. Why?
...what...?
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
It's a plastic, yeah.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok.
No.
I don't know.
How?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why?
I didn't do it.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your name?
Barry Egan.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
337.....I'm sorry....
Can you say that my name is Jack?
What?
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
Thank you.
Hi Walter.
That was weird. I meant good.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Ok.
Yeah.
Hi.
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
Is this where you live?
Are you serious with this?
You can't be late.
Seriously.
I know.
I'll see you there.
I won't.
When can you leave?
David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Nothing.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
You ready?
Are you coming to eat with us?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Ok.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
No one's forcing you to listen.
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Not now, or we're both done for.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
By whom? The Marquis?
I must grant him his last rites.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
You among them?
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
That's enough.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
What on earth would that require?
Coulmier, you animal!
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
AND DID YOU?
Go to hell!
Was it impotence?
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Of course.
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
And his writing?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Yes?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
You find this amusing, do you?
Oh indeed?
It was not inspired by circumstance.
Poorly.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
But I am history.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben?
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
Don't start --
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Is it awfully violent?
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
What's that then?
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
I am not a wealthy woman.
What thought is that?
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
-- words alone are insufficient.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Of course.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
You've come to lecture me?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
Last week would this be?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
You're just scared.
Am I?
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Houdini mice.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
The actor
And director.
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Pops
Yes.
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
There is nothing to discuss-
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I don't want you to--
How so?
Yes?
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Sir?
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
No -- no -- I mean--
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Nonsense
Nope.
Not for me.
Right-
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
And what does he see?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Hedy Lamarr?
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
Christ.
It's too late. The movie's made
Kinda.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
Yeah, ain't it swell?
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Very generous
You're lying to me.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Jesus
Ah, it's a grand title.
They've all seen a rough cut
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
The ad..
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
For Christ's sake, shut up--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
I really think you're
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
We done?
I'm Christ
About what?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
What?
You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
It's not done.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
You want me to do what?
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Huh?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
What do you mean?
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What did Tommy say?
Where you been?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
So what?
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
Nine o'clock.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
Just keep your eye on the ball.
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
Jake...
No, I'm not.
That he's got a pretty face.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I went to the movies.
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
What?
Why don't you just call him?
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
All right, just don't make any noise.
But they don't have a case against you.
Don't make no difference no more.
C'mon, Tommy --
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Right, the gym.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
And you're drinking with them right now.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
That's what they call a family problem.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
His wife took a trip.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
Do that.
I was jaywalking.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
-- until yesterday morning.
What time?
Six ayem.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Who left -- where?
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
You sure it belongs to his wife?
That depends on who "they" were.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
Wrong day?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
You did.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Next time, have some good news.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Jeff --
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Why should I?
I don't know what you mean.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
Well, I only quote from the best.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Lisa Fremont.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
No.
She's just not the girl for me.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
That's the hard part.
People have different emotional levels that --
How did you know!
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Huh?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
Got a shovel?
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.
Not a word.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Anything else bothering you?
Only because it's expected of her.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
That's good news.
Yes.
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
I think it's enchanting.
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Now, Lisa --
You'd better before you catch the disease!
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
There's nothing to see.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
What are you getting at?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
To get on home.
Not yet!
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
Shut up. I'm all right.
Phone number?
Chelsea 2-5598.
Friend of yours?
Nobody chickened.
Give me some dirt.
You watch too much television.
I'm cute, too.
What?
Chicken?
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
Glad to meet you.
How'd he get in?
You see any cops?
No.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Yeah!
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
Well, now--
Will you wait a minute?
I don't want to learn that!
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Say, listen--
Sorry.
Have some cigars.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Are you going down there?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I know.  That's why I came back.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
No.  It's perpetual motion.
What?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
Yeah.
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
What?
Man, you're schizoid!
I'm what?  What?
Your father!
I'm here.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
My gun?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
Why?
They like you.  Okay?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
That's a fine way to behave!
Goodbye, dear.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Do I have to spell it out?
Leave me alone.
I don't know why--!
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
If he could--
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
You serious?
Yes, ma'am.
Now that's true!
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Won't mother be proud.
Dig the square wardrobe!
Oh.
A what?
I'm not so bad.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
No.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
What?
I never felt so clean before.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
Yes.  My best friend.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Hi.
He hates me.
Do you think your father means that?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
I'll never get close to anybody.
My mother?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
No.  Why?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
What?
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Gabriel -- !
What are you doing here?!
YES!!!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
Searching for a money man...
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
Yeah.
No, no --
No, hey, I like your coat --
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
Smile.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Tell me again.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Nick --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
You're in on this.
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Canada.
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
What?
We? What "we"...
Nick...
Get your own room.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I don't know...
No.
You shouldn't have.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I shared his cell!
Yes!
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
Bam Bam.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
I did.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Why not.
You do.
Get out.
Don't tip.
...never... tried...
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
You need six.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
How'd you know my name...
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
What... Powwow...
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
Hi, Nick.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
I promise you, I didn't know!
It's a roach, guy --
Oh, man --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Not yet.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Yeah.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Thought you hate your old man.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Standing right here, man!
YOU TELL HER!
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
I... sorry, Mister...
But... I had a five...
I'M NOT NICK!
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Yes.
That I should've picked you up?
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
You ain't dying, he is.
Was he all pissed off?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Bullshit.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
Yeah.
What about?
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
What?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
I can do that.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
What? Snap out of it!
Sure.
Take a seat.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
You gonna put it away?
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Like hell I am.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
I don't like alarms.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
I don't believe in it.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Fuck all that.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
What's wrong with it?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.
Where?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
If we don't, he'll die.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
There's a slight difference.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Nobody. The light was bad.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
It doesn't matter who they are.
You can stay here if you like.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Go on, there's a good boy.
Yeah.
He's learning his letters.
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
The who?
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
What?
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
It's going to Sonora.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Maybe they will.
Why?
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I don't want to run short.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
Swimming.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
You better start.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
You want to split up? --
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Kind of sore.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
What's botherin' you, anyway?
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Yes, people make me restless.
There aren't any women here.
Depends on how good you drive.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
Stop it --
What for?
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
That's the end of the line.
Then I know my alphabet.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Sure.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
If you need me, I'll be --
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Do I know you?
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Psychology.
Yeah, me too.
Okay.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Okay.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Alright!
Let's get outta here.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Thanks, I'll be fine.
That means more screen time for us.
Oh, right.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Made you say it!
Both of them?
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Yes!!!!
Quick, everyone to the lab.
We have to destroy him.
My child you are the only survivor.
Huh?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Got my camera right here.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Don't touch me!!
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
What's this?
That one.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Just a little experiment.
You do.
That's right.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
How is she?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Dog, you look hot.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
This is so silly. 
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Don't I get a kiss?
Oooohhhh.
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
...People who don't mind their own business.
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
GODDAMN YOU!
COCKSUCKER! 
Are those pussy-willows?
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Bon Appetit!
Certainly not!
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Yes you are.
How to send a bill!!
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
I'll give you fifty cents.
Yeah - sure.
You can?
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Where?
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Let's get out of here.
Yes, I understand.
Drink.
No.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
What sort of danger?
She can only use cash.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Redi's all right.
She's a pretty good sort.
I ought to know.
Nothing.
No. She asked about the trademark.
You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
I don't know.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
Why wait?
You will die.
Good-bye.
Yes.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
Well, since, you're over twenty one
What a peculiar question.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Perhaps
You know where she is?
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
No. She's no longer under my care.
I'm very, very serious.
No, she's with her sister,
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
That's too bad.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
Please.
What did he say?
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
It won't hurt.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Curious.
Oh, uh-huh.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Lawyers.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
Kids? What about them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Do you want me to?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You went out with her?
No.
Everything about sex.
I know.
She said it on her tape.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Don't you want to make one?
Yes.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
So you have had sex.
Her name was Elizabeth.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
What was the problem?
I'm not planning on it.
Why not?
Yes.
No.
Not entirely.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
No.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I'm not either!!
Loud.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
I take it you've never masturbated?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Why?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Do you have to say that?
What?
I say it because it's descriptive.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
He doesn't have a phone.
And... do whatever it is you do.
Will you stop? Jesus.
I just thought it might --
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Well, why?
No, it's nothing like that.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
I don't know.
Why did you do that?
You touched him?
What is it?
It does not.
Okay.
So will you, someday.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't give you my address?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Why don't you let me tape you?
About what?
How long will it take?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Just a moment.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Is that what he tells you?
Hi.
I can't talk you into it?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
When?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
What's so stupid about it?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
You trust him.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Not for three-fifty.
She held up very well.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
God, you need help.
No.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Goddamit...
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
I see. Then what brought you up here?
He sounded fine.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
That you, Rog?
Yes?
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
I don't get it.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
Time to check with Flavors.
Nothing.  Just...memories!
I got it!  I got it!!!
I got it!  I got it!!!
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Why Janet?
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Everything's free there.
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
In a little masquerade?
I don't want to get up there.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
I'd forgotten.
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
YOUNG BLOOD
No...couldn't I do this later?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Fabulous!
WHAT A JOKE...
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
You guys having fun?
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
Say, is Maya working?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Stephanie.
Oh yeah.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
And?
That's a good age.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I owe her a call anyway.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
Huh.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
She works for tips!
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
She's been leaving messages here too.
I will.  See ya!
Yep.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Huh.
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Throw me his ball.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
What exactly are we going to do?
I SAID OKAY?
I know what you need.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
That's thoughtful.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
What?
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
What?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
No way. No way.
Please, Miles, please.
Yeah.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
That was quite a day yesterday.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
I'm fine. You rest.
What the fuck!
You need a new car anyway.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Why don't you come in?
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
The Windmill.
Twelve months in oak.
She got anything good?
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Oh. You mean... today?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
Yeah? Like what?
Like what a fraud he was.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Well, nice to see you now.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
I'm sure he believed every word.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Victoria.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
I'm pregnant.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
About a year.
Both.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Only for pee or poop.
Right.
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
Dad!
Who said I was going to die?
You love walks.
...I will.
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
That's right.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What does it matter then?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
Ray Reddy's house.
I'm close.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Yes.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
What about them?
There are none.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Sounds like a virus.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Pinned? What does that mean?
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
No money, eh?
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
It was my fault.
McKendrick.
Did it seem short to you?
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
Goodbye?
That's why I'm here.
I already did that.
And they were two of them. Look --
Ten A.M.
Where's Turley?
South of here, past Chimayo.
It's a town...
I expect.
Women?
Which way do you mean?
It's not going to be easy.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
No hard feelings.
You own this land.
What about the law?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
Because they don't like what I want.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
The other guy drew first.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
What now?
He is now.
Who is he?
Let's get out of here.
I'm done talking. Get out.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Who did it?
I don't have any family any more.
Rae, I need help.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
What's stopping you?
Good luck, Mal.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
What about his brother?
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Why'd you go into business with him?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Here he comes right now.
He left me.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I don't want you to get hurt.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
I thought you two would get along.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
I don't know if that's going to happen.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
If it's on the page...
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
What about it?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
Soon.  Soon.
She doesn't want pity.
No.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
I do?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Not quite.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Not if I don't let her.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
So you did meet her?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
You look so, so...
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
Please put your clothes on
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
And what may I ask brought this on?
Clyde.
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it.
Body double.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Why not?
Somebody said she was here.
Simone!
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I'm already dead.
She still with Kent?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
I read.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
If anyone asks about Simone --
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
Precisely.
Really?  Too bad.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
What?!
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Yes.
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
What if it catches on fire?
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
-- What you don't understand --
... digitized.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
The only real truth is in the work.
You know what I'm talking about.
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
--Do I know you?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
I didn't leave you.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
No.
If it's okay with you?
How do you draw now?
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
I guess they don't.
You mean aneurysm.
Look over there.
He your best buddy?
I don't tell her a thing.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
What kind of words?
No.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Cats?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Soon. One week.
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?
What happened?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
I guess she did.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I definitely won't.
What?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
Tell you my secrets.
They did?
Yes.
They scare me too sometimes.
What?
I know.
They used to hang people here.
Stop looking at me.
Who!
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--
Meaning?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Could take a little while, though.
Two.. maybe three days.
Nope.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Bitch.
Which street corner?
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
"-- an AXE!"
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
You know who I am. You invited me.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
This is his room... isn't it?
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
"Blood?"
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
Who you callin' "boy?"
He started it.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Is that right?
Let it go.
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
Look. You want to talk about this?
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
No. Not without you --
Never.
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
No. What?
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Yeah. Good.
You took Bill.
And this is mine.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
Shelby --
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
What?
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
How many you need?
All the rib eyes?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Okay.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
What other stuff?
Gold--digger, huh?
Hey, look!
Margaret.
You.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
You know how rumors start.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
An existentialist.
Okay.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Would I lie to you?
We lost him.
Eleven.
Yeah.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Ummm?
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Hey...
That man is your father?!?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
You sure do.
No what?
That's me.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Waynette!
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
See.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Let's keep it that way.
They're jammed!
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
This is Bandit I, come back.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Do I have a choice?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I'm at marker eight-five.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
We're gone.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
That's correct.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
You have a butler working that floor?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
No.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Yeah.
Ww... uh...
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
I got his machine.
I left him a message.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
Look at the collar on that coat...
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Without peer?
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
They what? What? No. No. Why?
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
You're finished.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
It's gettin' done Sid.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
For real?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
Like a mafucka.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
What?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
You're not Gibarian...
A puppet.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
That's fantastic.
Why did you agree to come here?
Why would you let her to do that?
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
What?
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Why, who did you see?
Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Will she come back?
I wish you'd told me.
I don't know.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
What is it?
Why?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Human beings can die.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
No.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
To calm your anxiety.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
Stop.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Those are dreams.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
If you're here.
I love you.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Thank you.
You never said you wanted one.
I want you here.
Who are you, then?
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
But then I would be dead now.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
He won't.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
I'll come with you.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
How did you know?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
Could be, I guess.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
But "nice".
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
Claire, will you calm down?
Stop being nuts!
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Not exactly.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Oh God, that's great!
Are you okay?
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I know.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
So.
I do.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Not if you don't want me to.
Sure we are, let's go!
What are you talking about?
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
I might stop you.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
I'll be right up.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
What about Tommy?
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Yes.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
What the fuck you doin'?!
Okay, I guess.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's what?
Let me see.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
I'm always here, Pete.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Flash, drop it--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can we make it a hundred?
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Some things you should say anyway.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
Does it have a human name?
Hi, Adele.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Oh, Peter. A zit.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Aunt May, what happened?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I don't care.  Cretin.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Right.  Let's go.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Just drop me off here.
Is you all good Nazis?
Any news on Dunbar?
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Looks good outside.
Okay. Move on.
Get going on the trap door.
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Yeah. Security.
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
And maybe a little something else?
You make my mouth water.
No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
How much more do we have to take from him?
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Sefton!
What some brandy?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
It's on me.
I'll live.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
You should live so long.
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Me? What if she don't want me?
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
You'll fix me up!
She'll never forgive me!
That's what I wanna hear.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
I'll open mine, too.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Good.
Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Says who?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
You starting that again?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
I called it the last time, didn't I?
You can tell Father Murray to --
Shapiro. Shapiro.
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Thirty-fifth.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
We have no radio.
Ich weiss alles.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
What guy?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Not particularly.
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
When is it expected back?
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
I believe so.
I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
Really? What do you feel?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
One minute to warp core breach.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
Where is he now?
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
It's our pleasure.
Oh, of course.
Please, I insist.
Better?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Where are the deflector relays?
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Thank you, Number One.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
No. Thank you.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
What if I told you I found a new truth?
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Lock phasers and return fire!
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Nothing. As before.
What did you see, Chekov?
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
On screen.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
David... Sorry I'm late.
It's a little early to celebrate.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Did your collaborator know?
... How long?
I don't understand.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
None that I can detect, sir.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
What's wrong?
Saavik... Is... David with you?
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Count on our help, sir.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
With some on the planet...
Go, Sulu!
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.

Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Understood, my lord.

Wait!... Wait...

Sir, may I --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
All true.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
I'm not a drama critic.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
And who am I hiding from?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
... taking Genesis away from us...
Carol!
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Who --
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
What's the matter -- ?
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
We appear to have plenty of time.
How soon --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
I'm trying, David.
I am truly sorry.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
No!
Rake her.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
KHAN!
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Aye, sir --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Aye, sir.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Not at present.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
To be sure, Captain.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
How far?
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Best we could do in two hours.
Steady as you go...
The ship -- out of danger?
Yes --
Or the one.
Spock...!
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Take the test again.
HURRY.
Stage Two of what?
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Power levels quite low, sir.
Aye, sir.
Dismiss the company.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Try again.
I'll try, Captain.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
Never, sir.
Aye, sir.
You do this -- for friendship?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Please...
A moment alone, please.
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
It'll come back to him.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
That's crazy!
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
What do you think, Spock?
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Well nobody's perfect...
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
Name?
I'm wery sorry, but --
Shields, aye.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Iowa.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Right.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
But Kirk...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
... Damn!
A spaceship with a missing man.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
You've programmed that from memory...?
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
How do you know this...?
Yes.
Ah... The giants.
Why not?
I cannot tell a lie.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
... I see.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
The tank will be finished by morning...
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Thank you, Spock.
Then... Where the hell are we?
Weapons systems?
What is our condition?
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Put them on screen!
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
How long, Scotty?
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
... Yes?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
... Are you joking?
The keyboard... How quaint.
That's the ticket, laddie.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
This way!
I thought it might begin the healing process.
You're what?
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
Sometimes I do.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
No one's ever asked me that before.
No... I want to stay with you...
Data doesn't breathe.
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
Is it safe to move her?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Understood.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
I'll be in Engineering.
That's your expert opinion?
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Options?
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
How long 'til they reach us?
Deck ten.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
We're trying to get to you, sir...
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
Wine, women and song.
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
What...?
Was I doing something to your neck?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
I look forward to reading your report.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
No.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
What's still there?
I'm on it...
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Active.
Ready.
Yes.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
'Fraid not.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Some.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
No. It's a lot further than that.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Worf... torpedo... now!
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
No, sir.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
What?
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Destroy the deflector dish.
Right.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
The charge is murder.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Fascinating...
I didn't mean this future.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
To be -
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
We were until your torpedoes!
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
You feign ignorance?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Aye, sir; thrusters...
You tell them, Lieutenant.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
I shall look forward to it.
They'll be here...
Krandog aranty.
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
It IS possible.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Possibly.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Right -
I always wanted to try that.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
You hear that?
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
Perhaps you're right.
So, that's it..
What peace conference?
Why would they give them to us?
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
WE SURRENDER.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
That the universe will unfold as it should.
You can't prove any of this...
Confirmed, Captain!
Visual!
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
Would they?
What exactly does that mean?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat
You are me.
Because you are dangerous.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
And this makes you "sad"?
To new worlds...
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes, sir.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Yes.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Sir.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.

The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
With pleasure, Captain.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
I know how he thinks.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
What do we know about the planet?
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
That's an order, Commander.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
On screen.
Your new chair, sir.
Still well on our side...
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Counselor?
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
How did you end up on Remus?
No race should be a slave to another.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
In time.
You're not Reman.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I won't defend my life to you.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Find her again.
A matter of hours now.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
For the moment.
No, we can handle this.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
I'll have to run your card off now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
It's still the full price.
You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
What was your last stop?
About five miles back.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Neither did I.
When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
Clarify that.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
What?
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Which way do you want to go?
Steering wheel.
Good.
That way.
Pancakes.
X...
Yes. Very good.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Jennyhaydn.
I know.
I am husband?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
No.
A drink.
It was yellow.
Yes.
Yes. Day... night.
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
No.
A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...
What is hitchhike?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Yes.
Then don't be smart.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
No.
Yes?
It was a mistake.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
The captain...
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
What is hell?
It's bad.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
Yes.
No. Get in.
Come on.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
I do not get cold.
Nothing.
Horses.
I gave you a baby last night.
But...
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
No, thank you.
I will wave to you.
You could have killed us both!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Get Fox.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
I did.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Bullshit!
You have no conception of this, do you?
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
I know, but...
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
I wouldn't think so.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Maybe later.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Forget it's there.
No, Lenny.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
You think Tran killed her?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
He records himself raping and killing her--
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Is he dead?
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
What do you mean?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
Jesus!
You bet.  Did you like it?
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
Naawww.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
So lay it off to somebody else.
What else you got?
What?
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Your existence.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Coming with you.
Let's talk in the car.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
She's my destiny.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Are you sure it's real?
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Something in your car...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
Well, look at the plus side.
It was a tough call.
Why?
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
You never told me.
Yeah.  We did.
See you downtown.
Yeah.  See you there.
Just Lenny.
Are you going to make me beg?
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
You really want that on your head?
Testa?
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Yeah.
No, sir.
You're thinking...?
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
You tell me.
Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Look...
You're a... you're sick.
What do you want from me?
What did he look like?
He had an orange hat on.
What about his killer?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
We have another one.
What are you doing?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
I was visiting an old college friend.
I was looking for a pattern.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
None taken.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
A very sexy case.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
What's that?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Oh yeah, I forgot.
I know.
What did you tell him?
Not about coming to see Daitz?
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Sue Ann Hanson.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
I just need to go a little slow.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
What's going on?
You were right. He found me.
Does one exist?
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
What's going on?
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
All the same killer?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
I've got to take a piss.
The little piggie speaks.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Yes, sir.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
I don't carry it with me.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[You tell me.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Koessler?
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
I don't...
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
I know, I know.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
Shuddup.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
What's that like?
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
You better pay the man.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
Just like that?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
To do what?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
What else is going on?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
Did you get it?
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Listen. I had a great time.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...The red piece of shit over there...
How are you doing?
I thought you met someone else.
...the Michelin commercial...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Well that sucks.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
It's a gig.
What do you want? You're tall.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I'll give you an eight. 
Darwinism at its best.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
There's the rub.
I just tested for one...
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
She wasn't your type anyway.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
Sure.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
...He's derivative...
Not well.
Rejected?
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
I don't know...
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
What?!?
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Baby, we're money.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
What?
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I don't think so.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Michelle went for you, right.
How?
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
He drives a carriage.
No. Doesn't that suck?
Yeah. You met him once.
Which one?
What?
She didn't notice.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
What a surprise.
No, baby!
I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
No.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...You're just poking at it...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...you're money...
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's on.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
Good.  He never doubted you.
Godfather.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
I'll come to you when I need you.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
OK, but be careful.
The gun will be there.
Maybe less...
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
And with prison record.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
No, I wanted other things for you.
You wanted me to be your son.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Mike!
Get rid of them...
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
We're all tired...
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
And when they shot me father...
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
Mama, no.
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
What time do they expect us?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I'm busy.
Is it true?
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
Until the old man tells me different.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
To the city.
I won't panic.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
Be patient.
He talked to you?
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Is he alive?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I don't get it.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Did you speak to my father?
No, I like him.
I don't like you.
Shut up.
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Yes please!
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I met him in New York.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
This is so good of you.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
I played piano in a few places.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
That's good.
I've got plans!
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
So cool.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Dickie?
I guess.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Hardly.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Okay.
I hope she never knows.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
He's not a man, he's a god.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
It's superb.
I'm fine.
So I'm learning.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Where's Dickie?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
That's a terrific idea.
He's having an early night.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
Why? When?
I don't believe you.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Oh Marge.
How would you know that?
I hope so.
I think we sort of found each other.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
What?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Beating you away.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
A ragione. A ragione. 
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
Nothing.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Or Tom and Peter even.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Even your fiance...?
What about Thomas Ripley?
A few days ago.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Who mam?
You want to canvass?
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Really?
What did you do?
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
I know. I could have picked you up.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
You must be rich.
What?
Kris Kristofferson.
I bought a couple of tickets.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
I mean porno movies.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Sure.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Kidding around... you know, fun.
With who?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
That's fine.
The kind with a brush.
Could you see anything?
And what happened?
That's a nice name.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
Don't you want to go?
But that one night?
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Huh?
You a narc?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You don't have to.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
Yes I am.
Got your license?
Yes.
I know. I tried that.
Twenty-six.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
No.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Well, I just, you know...
It happens.
Like do anything, you know.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus...
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Wait.  Where're you going?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
It's possible.
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
I do?
I did?  Huh!
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Why me?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Yes.  Hic!
Do you have the...
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh...
Oh.
Nine hundred...
I don't smoke?
Oh.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes, sir.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
I'm not refuting anything.
Well, then, as what did you go?
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Go ahead, son.
Well, son, you're home!
By all means.
No.  But...
But what?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Ah.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Well, yes, that she was.  She certainly made this place a home.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Dad, I...
Did I what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Vultures...
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
What.
The G-man?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
I guess I did.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Can we get him to the hospital?
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Who the hell is this "they?"
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Thanks.
Oh...
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
No.  Absolutely not.
Cathy?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
No, not really.
No. Just a few hours.
Yes.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
Would you like some brandy?
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
What do you mean?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Then why did she object to you?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
No!
Are you coming to my party?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Is she all right?
Lois!
No, it's Lois!
Morning.
Try my best.
Yep.
I see. How do I get down there?
It's a surprise, you see.
Where would I get a boat?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Thank you.
Yep?
I need her exact name, you see.
It's nothing.
Shall I call the doctor?
They're back!
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
Whose side are you on?
I told you. We met yesterday.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
What happens when we run out of wood?
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
We won't be here.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
What good will they do?
What?
Cathy. At the school.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
And if you don't?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
I couldn't ask you to.
We know what it is, Al.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Sixty...  Oh.
Lovebirds.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Doesn't what make me...?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
How can you tell?
All right.  She smiles back.
Hey, wait a minute!
We never met in court or anyplace else.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I didn't break that window!
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Why... 
Oh, no you don't!
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
Look, Mr. Brenner...
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Seven o'clock then.
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Will I be seeing you again?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Oh. That. Rome.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
So you didn't go to school together.
You were lying.
I wrote the letter.
But not for me.
Yes.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
What?
I'll get it.
It's an uprising.
Growing a beard...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Take wing!
It was like that yesterday.
...everything I know.
What time is it?
Wait here. Don't move.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
And he'll talk?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Well, all right, but...
I have no idea.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
These weren't a few birds.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
To...  To kill them.
No one called it a war!
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
We need them.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
Of course I will.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
It is a pity.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
Where can I find him?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
We can't be sure of that.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
Pulse?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
What?
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
Not yet.
An old acquaintance, eh?
I want it --
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Afraid of what?
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
I've ordered nothing from you.
Get out of here!
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
Any attacks of pain since?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Aye.
Where are they? Last chance.
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
We won't.
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Keep that thing away from me.
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
Who are you?
What did they give you?
How can you die if you're already dead?
How do you know?
You killed that cop Dutton.
Yeah, I know.
Have to find him first.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
I know.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
I do. Every day.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
Look, can I just call a cab?
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't believe you.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
He'll be there at 8:30.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you care to be more specific?
No -- not at all.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Where is that?
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
Yes -- I think so.
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
I don't believe it.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
You still haven't answered my question.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
Is it real?
Looks real to me.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Naturally I think so.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Goodnight, my dear.
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
It won't work.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I was.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
I'm sorry.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
That's right.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
This one could save your life.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
You gotta drive!
Zero.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Maximum body-count.
Star?...
What?...
Why?  They're only noodles.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
With him?
Yeah.
No.  Stick around.
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Chill out Edgar.
What?
Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
I thought we were goin' into town.
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
Did we have a date tonight?
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Mom... please.
What's that smell?
Smells like something died.
I thought we were poor.
Can we get a T.V.?
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
In here?
Not funny, Sam!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
But, Mom...
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
I just wanted to... I, uh...
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
What do you mean?
I'm Michael.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Okay.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Let's go see them.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Then it's not too late for us...
Take laddie.
Huh?
Nowhere.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
Piss off.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
I don't know.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
I don't know who to trust.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
We'll see...
Cool it, Palmer!!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Well, go on.
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
What clothes?
For your health.
Thank you.
Bennings?
A couple of hours.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
What's that?
Well, stick to it.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
And that was enough?
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
Well, let's get down there.
When do you think it got to him?
What?!
On the towers?
I'm training to be a high climber.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
But you're only a mud carrier.
This is it?
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Excuse me?
Last night.
What?
It was meant to.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
This way.
What do you mean?
No...
End...?
Vox...
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Created?
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
Why would you let me go back?
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
I -- what are you?!
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
Talk away, Professor.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Your birth stone.  I thought --
Dance with me...
Holding you... again.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
It's only a machine.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
You sound like my father...
What?
I'm sorry, David.
Then why are you here?
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
What is it?
I would.
I can't do that --
Thank you...
Yes...
Thank you.
Your husband is dead?
Then you can speak slowly.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Why not?
Why would you do that?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
I will...
Thank you...
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Every night.
I don't understand.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
What are you?
How do you decide?
Learning was important?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
Orion's belt...
Yes.
If you only knew...
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
So you can use it now?
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
May I get you some --
That'll be all.
Imagine that.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Do they?
No, sir --
Sir --
New Yorkers.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
We don't know.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
Then it's time to change that --
We are what we are.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
No, sir.
Then don't.
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
Temporarily.
How?
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
[Beat] Thank you.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
No, it hasn't.
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
What for?
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
How'd he die?
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
They're not.
[Beat, lost] No.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
To the hospital.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
I don't understand.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
No. I don't want it to.
I never knew my father. Did you?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
I'll die either way.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
2004.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Why not?
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
You told me this was how it happened.
What for?
Don't you go to jail for that?
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
Becker does? Are you sure?
No.
Where are you going?
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
Sure.
[Beat] Thanks.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
No, I'm ok.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Thanks.
Yup. That's me.
I don't know, but I think part of it's...
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Hon?
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Yes, baby?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
In the leg.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
You girls are in some hot water.
Yes, sir.  I know.
How are things goin' out there?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Tell us about him.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
Louise is alright.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
I always knew that.
Not yet.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Maybe.
Maybe.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Why now, Jimmy?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
I'm choking on it.
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
I'll call you right back.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Ready when you are.
Get the car.
West.  Left.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Will I be?
Thelma kinda took to him.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
What happened?
Lemme see the map.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Try to.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Yeah.
Before.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Well, you got it now.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Thelma!
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
Just asking.
You know why.  You already said.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What do you mean?
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Good.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
You're drivin'.
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
What in the hell is that up there?
Way up ahead!
All this for us?
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
You got that right.
Grrrreat!
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Good-looking?
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Well why don't you look her up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
You're kidding? What did they say?
Never met him.
What?
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Hm?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
Huh.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Call you back.
Thanks.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Thanks.
Nepal? Have you been?
You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
By the way, what's your name?
It's right there on your golf bag.
What's that?
No, I mean
Great.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Huh... that's strange.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Who the hell's Woogie?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
She's blackmailing you, right?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Oh my.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Uh, that's okay.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Good good.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
What?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Harvard?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
What do you mean?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
And you met Mary how?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
That must make it tough.
Oh. Well I am.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
I'd go with the seven.
No I'm not.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Why?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Oh Jesus...
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
You betcha!
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Oh... are you... ?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Thanks.
Hm?
No short game.
We've got a lot in common.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Yeah, sure.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Go!
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
No, that's really unneces --
Teddy, be brave.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
So what's up?
Eh.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes, sir.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
What if I can't?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Yeah.
I, uh...
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
I don't care. Cancel it.
No way.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I know, I know...
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Hey. Nice tie.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Oh, yeah -- right.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
It ain't Geronimo.
Tell him, Ray.
Good. Thank you.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
Beats the hell outta me.
I got one up on ya.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Let's see it.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
When did we get that?
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
She's that subtle?
Yes.
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Bullshit.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
A what?
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
It's not real.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Stop.
1868...
What?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
We're going for The Stronghold.
Some Indian time?
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
How the hell do you know?
I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
It's not that.
I could be, too.
I'm with someone.
How did you know this was my car?
That's all!
Where were you?
Apology acknowledged.
There you go with those moves again.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
How about what?
What plane.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Winston Churchill.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
Are you really that brave?
Just good luck.
Where'd you get it.
That's what you get flight pay for.
You don't have to do this.
Do what, show you a good time?
What?
Hardly ever.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
True.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Tomcats?
Sir?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
What is he doing?
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Were upside down!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
Since when did you care about paperwork?
Okay, okay.
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
BREAKING LEFT!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Okay.
Is it the plane?
But I have to!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do I want?
Why do they call you Wolf?
Oh...I'll think of something.
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
No shit. The Iceman....
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
What'd you do?
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
Don't.
Skipper, you can't do this!
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
SHIT!!
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
Figured out what?
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
Some guys never get it back.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Bad?
How's it goin', Coog?
Is that how you remember it?
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
I called your house.
I don't know...
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Definitely.
Get it, please.
May I use your pen?
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
I am Quaid.
I know that.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Don't be an idiot.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
At Rekall.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Swallow this.
Where?
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Relax, you'll live longer.
On his way.
I don't know.
Melina!
Rekall?
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
How was your trip to Mars?
What are you, my father?
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
What is it?
Come on!
Quit while you're ahead.
Nobody.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
Tell me!
Move to Mars.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
I'm not your wife.
And falling in love?
Bullshit.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
What's in the two week package?
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
What's he talking about?
Let me go!
I love you.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Why would I lie to you?
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I saw them.
I don't need Kuato for that.
You two-faced-bastard.
Aliens built it.
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
I think I scared it!
In a minute.
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Val!  Val!
You're hung up again.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
The rifle.
Great.  Thank you.
Oh shit!
Sons of bitches!
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Right.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Like hell you are.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Yeah, Val.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Okay, ten dollars.
Yeah, geography.
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Why do you all keep asking me?
I know about Esparza.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
Correct.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
I have to talk to your brother.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
-- The Nazi he knifed?
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
You really think that's what happened?
...Are you sure we want that?
Eddie... I don't know about this...
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
-- What?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
I'm not that desperate.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
...For ten years, now.
You're doing a murder case?
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
I embroidered.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
I haven't paid you.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Racist asshole came at me.
I killed the motherfucker.
But why?
-- About what?
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Shu Kai Kim.
This and that.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Calls for speculation.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
No? Then what did he say?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
That's right.
-- Roger --
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
And its purpose?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
NO! GOD, NO...
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Don't get funny with me again.
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Smell something fishy, huh?
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Tell me about the letter.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Say no more.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Thanks.
I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
What do you mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
Yes, he is like a clown.
The usual, 9:15.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Call me.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
Nothing.
Not you, Donna, not you.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
How did the car get back here?
Cause I like it.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Bob.
What does Bob say?
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Okay.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
It does matter. We're in love.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
James...
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Oh, Laura.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
When he finds out.
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Dad...
Yes.
I always thought you knew it was me.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
I can arrange that. I like that.
Who am I?
I don't know.
That's right.
You're right. There's no one here.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Four cases in three years...
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
Yes.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
I... yes.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You've just said you signed it.
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Orthopedics?
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Say it.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Well, we...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
There's nothing they can do to me.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I... um...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
Yes.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
I'm sorry...?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Yes...
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Yes.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
The TV didn't work.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Laura.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
You, you don't under...
No... no...
What are you going to do?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Let me talk to Mickey.
From the magazine?
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who are you protecting, then?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
...I understand...
He's not in, Sir.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Thanks, Franky.
Uh...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Yeah. I'm awake.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
The 'History'...?
In New York?
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
Should I?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
What's he like?
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Would you like some coffee, General?
Sure...get in!
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
It's gone now.
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
Don't let's lose each other.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
He's very excited about it.
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
No biggie, really.
Just be careful, okay?
Chase, it's Dylan!
What?  What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
He was just here!
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
What?
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Home, that's right.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Right 'cross the freeway.
Here.
I'm fine.
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Call it a guess...
When do you think it'll be done?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Really?
You really think Dylan's okay?
What are you talking about?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
You're kidding, right?
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Robert?  I...
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Not yet.
Guilty.
I haven't forgotten.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Thank you.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
What do you mean?
No, I can't.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
I know.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Why then.
Like this!
Is it true Phil?
I gotta go.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
I know enough.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Good.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
How do you know?  They might.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
You do?
Yes.  I do.
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Trust me donut.  I know.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
I don't have to listen to this.
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
It hurts too much to care.
You've gotta be kidding?
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
I am accountable.
No.  I didn't.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Y'all take American Express?
No.
Ready for another?
This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
What'd you say?
No, of course.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Thanks.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
But I am also with the government.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
How's that?
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Stab it and steer.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
Yeah?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
What'd you say to her?
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
Got anyplace special in mind?
Come look at this.
What's that, honey?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who do?
Who knows, baby?
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Yeah.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
You think she's pretty?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
You knew my daddy?
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
You upset with me?
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Now what?
Sailor?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You talk to 'im some?...
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
How can you say that, Sailor?
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Just a place.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
What if I asked you not to?
What if I told you not to?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Simple? Kill him? How?
No.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
On one condition...
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
No...
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
By who?
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I know... I remember.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
So I hear.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
You're stoned.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
He finished it Winter Break.
He is. Take my word for it.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Because... because...
Yes.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Maybe... I don't know.
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
Evidently.  Coming!
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Such as.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
You did.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Her dog, yes.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who's got a gun?
No, really...
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Stop calling me Vernon.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
With Emily?
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Yea?
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Well...
Really? That's remarkable.
So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.
I'll miss my bus.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
You?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Miss Sloviak's.
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
What'd he say?
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Yes.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Your aunt?
Carvel.
I never heard of it.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
When we fall, we fall hard.
Amazing.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
The hell I am.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
I'm sorry.
No thanks.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
What would you call them then?
When?
When nobody's looking.
Okay.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
I thank you.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
I got the message you called.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Yes.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Grady.
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
He told me.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I lost it all.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
It didn't come up.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
What's that?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Oh?
I... I...
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Oh... yeah.
As a heart attack.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
And?
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
Maybe I should read it.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Give me a break, Grady.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Just kidding.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
Just a few then. The big ones.
I doubt it, darling.
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Foreman now.
I like the noise.
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
Annette? She's good... tense.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
It wasn't like that.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What party?
The birthday party.
When?
Don't talk like that.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Sure.
The mother sure has her hands full.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
I can't.
I bet you can.
I have to go.
Cop.
Have a seat.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Got something to hide?
No.
Little Red Riding Hood.
What?
Know what?
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
I'd say you're moving.
Yes.
I count my blessings.
'Fraid not.
I'm adjusting okay.
But you are taking it?
You are in.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Why's that?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Are you sure?
They sound like finches.
Yes.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
How do you know?
Will I see you again?
That was a joke.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
That's right.
No way.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
It was just an idea.
No fucking way.
Then think about it.
I'm still thinking about it.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Honest? No.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
You have no feelings for your niece?
Do you think you're crazy?
Why do you think you're here?
We have a lot of work to do.
I want you to calm down.
Go home, Walter.
Sorry.
What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
To relax.
I don't see --
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where?
In my bed too.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
I was six years old!
Are you okay?
It's fucking freezing out here.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
I thought you were a dyke.
K through sixth.
You're damaged.
Yeah?
Why do you want to know?
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
Since you've had sex?
I thought I'd stay the night.
What for?
I suffer from insomnia.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
How young?
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Hey, I'm not --
Yes! I want to know.
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
They seduce you?
Bullshit.
What odds?
Why not tell me now?
No you don't.
Sneak up behind me like that.
I need a shower.
Not when they fly.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
No way that could just be seawater.
Hey, you okay?
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Not for long.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
What happened?
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
Cute, Virgil.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Now what?
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
Tell me later.
Hi, lady.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
God, I hate that bitch.
Everything is.
Got it. Over.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Turn it up, bozo.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Wilhite, anything?
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
What's the timer set for?
He's hallucinating badly.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
But you just said that a month was too...
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
Then why don't you try it on?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
And why did you drop them?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Okay. In a few minutes.
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
I love you.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
But why all nudes?
Who's moving?
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
You men are all so dreadful!
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
I'll go and get my valise.
Yes, we will.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Because...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
It's a sin to be fat.
Agnes...
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Why?
Say it!
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Everyone.
Oh, there are so many.
Yes.
At least once a week.
Where do you meet?
How were you sick?
The baby they made up.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Are you married?
Would you like some?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
Why should I?
Who?
You'll laugh.
No.
Because I don't want one.
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Everything... I don't have children.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
How?
She watches... she listens.
She tells you you're ugly?
And that you're stupid?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
How does she know that?
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why?
May I open my eyes now?
Would you like to tell me?
She made me promise not to.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Someone's following me.
Do you know who put it there?
What do you think it's there for?
What do you feel?
I have to throw up...
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Go away, I don't want you here.
Yes.
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
She'd seen him too.
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Agnes... Agnes...
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
I don't remember.
She took the baby in her arms?
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
???
Marty, what are you doing here?
Something they... that they overlooked.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
I'll have it.
Next week.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
The one up on the third floor?
Uh huh.
What does this have to do with..?
Who told you this?
Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Who was the father?
Was there a priest?
What's his name?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
So, someone else could have done it.
It's possible isn't it?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
And what happened?
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
What?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
What?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Nothing.
The sheets...
Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I haven't decided yet.
I know you don't.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Bullshit!
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Right...
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Of course.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
You think she's a saint?
Who is he?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
You tied the cord around its neck.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
We'd be thrown out.
Are you now?
Yeah?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Do I snore?
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Ta.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
I don't care.
Have I said something amiss?
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
You crawler.
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Gear?
I'm not ...
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Parading's better!
Yeah ... that's right.
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Oh, they seem all right to me.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Why do you always use your left hand?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
That's all right then.
For Ringo.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
I think you're soft or something.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Y'what?
No.
We were going to do it.
Aye, well, now! 
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Sit down, the lot of you.
You wouldn't!
Hi, our lot!
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Oh yes.
Is it?
I would have said so.
Temper! Temper!
Don't exaggerate.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
No, we're not!
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
That's too easy for Lennon.
Clever.  George.
Shurrup, cheerful.
A proper Aborigine.
Is that you, Roby?
Cattle ranch!
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Where the hell are we?
That's what I'm going to do.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
What's the terrain down there?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
Receiving.
No, you'll follow me.
I'm on my way.
Take a look.
Take care.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
Unknown.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
You know what they make this stuff out of?
That way.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
The water will still recycle.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
I kind of like it.
Well we better do something.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
It wouldn't come.
Maybe we can catch it.
Can you do anything for him?
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
Don't be an idiot.
At least it can't get up here now.
Does anybody know what happened?
<u>How</u>?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
Can you get them back?
What do you mean, no?
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Three blips!  They're coming this way!
Hey!  what about the film?
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
Thanks for the thought. 
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
You lead.
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
What is it?
Maybe we could write it together.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Are they close?
Okay.
Look --
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Yeah?
Any microorganisms?
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Still worried?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
We're coming!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
You win.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Right now let's keep it closed.
... More spores coming.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Yeah... I forgot.
Here, carry these.
Kablooey.
No... don't...
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
Do you want a tablet?
Yeah...
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Too many.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
You win some, you loose some.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
I dunno.
What?
That's a fact.
What?
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
I dunno.  Might be a glitch.
Thanks.
Where does that lead to?
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Compensate!
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Is that a fact.
Four.
Want some?
What do you mean?
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
What time's sundown?
Phoebe?
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Eddie...
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
You take charge.
I believe I will.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Just like that.
It wasn't meant to be.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
D-day.
Frankly - yes.
Why not?
What else?
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
I never intended you to be.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
I can't believe my ears...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
What of it?
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
I don't think I'm going.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
And too many of them are produced.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Margo.
Margo? Lunching in public?
I do not. How do you do?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
We have that in common.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Just slipped your mind.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
Huh?
Where?
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I told her. I sounded off.
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
I'll check with Eve...
It won't play.
Cut it out.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
I thought you were going to be late-
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Don't mix your metaphors.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
I will not calm down!
Here we go...
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
A married lady.
Why you have to go out there.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
I'm for it.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
You hear all kinds of things.
But she just got here...
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
Oh, brother.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
Well?
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Don't be dense. The party.
I - I guess I fell asleep.
What for?
It was for my report.
I might.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
I don't care if I never get home.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
He's the best.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Please...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I don't intend to be.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town...  ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him...  ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.  If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last...  Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again?  No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too...
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
I wouldn't like.
Of course.
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
She's just outside the door.
The heave-ho.
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
Roughly ten minutes.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
What about Bill?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Well...
About what?
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
With tears.
Easy, now...
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
Margo, again...
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Don't joke about such things.
Where'd you get all that information?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
That was a pity...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
What are you going to wear?
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
... Among so many quiet qualities.
What is he talking about?
Up in the room.
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
That's beside the point.
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
I have no intention of having an accident!
Too bad.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
She is a louse.
Call, what call?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
Miss Caswell?  What?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
That's my Max.
I didn't hear you.
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Yeah?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--a spy, you mean?
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--I'm trying--
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
And?--And?--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Were you eyebrow reading?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--has he got an ax?--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
--I haven't said anything--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
If he self-destructed.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
--'cause I only know four chords--
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
What's the matter?
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
This?  Naw...
--Howard Hunt?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
I'm so glad.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
--that was awhile ago--
--yes--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
There's always a later plane.
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
Just let me get a match.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
...No... never in so many words...
It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
To cover up?
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Electronic surveillance.
I have nothing more to say.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Yes, sir.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Go on.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Good God!
James McCord.
Where?
--I'm Woodward.
Are you sure?
No.
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
It is.
I really want to know.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
That was awhile ago.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
No, none of those.
No, it was good.
Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
...okay...
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yes ma'am, I am.
Neither did I!
What are we gonna hear?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
I'm glad you think so.
What?  No I'm not.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Because I want to.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
That's nice.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Sure.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
I'm not playing.
What's that?
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
...I've never tried it.
Sure.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
Do you?
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
You think she was serious?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
Yeah.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Don't you want me to?
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
C-Span?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
So do I, Kev.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
I know.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Strip?
Nadia, I can't --
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
You think so?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
That's my trick!
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Yes --
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Yeah.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
Okay.
Okay.
I love you.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Ready for what?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
What?!  How do I do that?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
Fuck yeah we will.
Bullshit.  From where?
Dude, he does not.
Shut the fuck up.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
But you better hurry.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
What?
And who's Claude?
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Serafine...?
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Yeah. French fries...
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
No... I...
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Yeah?
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Why the fuck would I do that?
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Because Gaston was after it.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
What do you mean, maniacs?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
When you're older . . .
I'm not sure but look. . .
I'm fine.
Yes, your highness.
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Why?
Now just get off the train.
No!
It's the best fork of all
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Anya... where are we?
I'll never let go!
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Shut up!
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
Watch me.
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Young	man, I...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
I had nothing to do with it!
Perhaps you could convince her?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
This guy's on television.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
All the good meetings are taken.
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
It's okay.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
That movie makes me feel guilty.
M'm.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Wisconsin.
Okay.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Don't be funny.
You want your tennis stuff?
You want your gear? Here you go.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Well... thank you again.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
No, I got time.
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
I know.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Yeah.
What?
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Oh.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Good? I was-
No.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
big subject with me, yeah.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Don't you think I do?
I dunno.
I have a tiny apartment.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Yeah.
You followed me!
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
Yeah?
M'm.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
David! David! I can't believe this!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Oooh.
No.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Is he in the bathroom?
Very big spider.
What?
W-w-whatta you mean?
Yeah.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
yes, we had, uh...
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
That's sick!
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Thanks, honey.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You're mad, aren't you?
The what?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Step up here!
What'd I do?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Why are you so hostile?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
My head is throbbing.
I have a headache.
You catch Dylan?
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
I mean that as a compliment.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Key word here is "indulgent."
What are you depressed about?
Right before his un-American thing.
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
You're crazy!
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Stop calling me Max.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
You wanna lie down?
What difference does that make?
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
Hi. How do you do.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
I look pretty.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
Yes, I do.
I just have time to get the, uh-
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
No, no, no, not at all.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Yeah.
Oh yes.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Why last?
And you've only just met.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Who, Sally?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
It's alright, isn't it?
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
It's not going to come up.
Don't you miss it?
Count on it.
Fuck you.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Sally?
When does he graduate high school?
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Harry called.
And?
Lucy overdosed.
Fuck you.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
And you know our friends, how?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
You only made half your quote this year.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
They're paying him scale.
Whatever you say.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
I'm ready.
Happy anniversary.
Hardly...
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
No.  I missed that.
We're great.
For good.
You want me to uninvite her?
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Well he can't have gone far.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Don't do this.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
You changed your mind.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Everybody hates the messenger.
I guess.
Will you make love with me?
Sure.
Yes.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
You're an interior decorator, right?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
No you're not.
What?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And you know, he really does not.
Let's go for a walk.
What am I, five?
I think he's really angry with me too.
A lot of cakes.
Come here.
I like you.
Sorry?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Trust him.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Yes.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
I don't need a drug.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Sally?
Not at all.
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Very.
Oh great.
You don't know she's a bitch.
How?
You see, that's worse.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Like the last time.
I wasn't finished.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
That's not an answer, is it?
You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
I'll be right out.
Evie has a little something for you.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
I hope they're watercolors!
She's such a great photographer.
I thought it was okay where it was.
I trust you.
And the food sucks, I know.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Oh honey, let's.
And Cal's this massive adult?
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
Quiet -- sshhh!!
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Want a list?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
And only you can become a Queen?
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
You held onto this all that time?
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
Of course not --
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Not that one.  Or that one.
No, sir!
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
...Not enough food?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
You're a real buddy.
Yeah.  How much?
Ma'am?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
I sort of like it.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
You mean tonight?
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
No. Like a man.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
So I see.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
You're so right.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
I thought so.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
No -- I don't want anything.
And where are you now?
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
Baxter.
As soon as I can walk.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I just want some fresh air.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Who'd care?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
For me?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
In this house, you're supposed to.
I guess so.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
In the knee?
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
You usually eat alone?
Fine. How's your eye?
Fine.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Mind if I come in?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
What for?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
You do?
That's right, Baxter.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Yes, sir.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Yes, of course.
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
You're going to take her off my hands?
You left your wife?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Yes, sir.
Naturally.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
No key!
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Me?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Sure, Doc.
What's this -- you packing?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
That so.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
Doctor.
And what happened to you?
No.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
Let me take that.
I missed you, Fran.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Handle what?
You know I do.
I promise.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, we better.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Stop that, Fran.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't.
Where does she live?
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
Go where?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
What !
You can keep your fucking fuel --
Moonby what?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Part.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
What unit were you with ?
I was an FO for the 25th.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
A sauciere --
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
I don't know.
Probably is.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
While you were sleeping.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
What is it?
Who knows? Right.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Would he remember you ?
Touchy.
Charlie?
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
They must have seen the fire.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
That's right, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Sure -- fine --
What?
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
Haiphong.
No. Walked.
What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Can you trust them?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
What about this point here?
Music?
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
The trees, eh...
I'm Kurtz.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
You know you're right.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
I love it.
You can't have water after morphine.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's yours?
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
I think think a lie stinks.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I had immense plans.
I was on threshold of great things.
You knew him best.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
No -- leave it --
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
Why?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
And shut up.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
No. Not really.
What's a big question?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Son of a bitch, sir.
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
94   CONTINUED:  
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
28   CONTINUED:
Had?
She's dead.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
Where'd you say Eric is?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
That's not what I meant.
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
Not me.  I'm equipped.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
What's going on?
So what's the problem?
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
A daughter in Oregon.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
I'm right behind you.
Forget it.  It would take days.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
I'm here to do my job.
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
You don't get it, do you?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
It's a spring day...
Where's my ELT?
Hate to disappoint you.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
I already have.
You don't know how true that is.
Shut up!
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
Let's get out of here.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
But I would.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
It's a long shot.
Not in the right hands it ain't.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
Not bad.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Will you please take it?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
No.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
You all set here?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Note. Put it in the note.
I want you to go on this trip.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Fries.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Never.
Here's the trouble with never.
It's one idea...
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
This one has a special meaning.
I should've danced with you.
Grouchy?
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Well...
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
How to die, mostly.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
All right, cut me a break.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
You think you're kidding.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
What are you trying to do to me?
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
Sure -- take him to the vet.
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Sure thing.
What?
Ask him.
What's he look like?
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
No, I didn't.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Verdell?
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Yo, yo, yo...
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I'm going back with you.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
What are you talking about?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Absolutely not.
What's it mean?
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
So you're from around here?
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
No shit.
Yeah.
Probably.
I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
What?
What?  You think I'm running you up?
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
No fucking way.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
Do you want Rath or not?
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
Um, five.
One hour per man.
Where are we going?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Yeah?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Turn off the engine.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
Someone hired both of you?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
We don't have a choice.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
Because I'm done.
It's not the same, is it?
Why didn't you finish this game?
He was killed.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Jesus -- why?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
I was just different.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Why not?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
Because I want to know.
No.  Just the first one.
Did it ever bother you?
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Mexico.
About?
I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
Yes.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
No.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Thank you.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Yes.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
Ten years ago.
What happened?
Was that it?
You didn't take it.
Ten years later, here you are again.
I think I got one today.
So?
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
No.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Am I attractive?
Both.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Was she the only one?
Uh-huh.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
I waited another four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Electra --
A pleasure doing business with you.
Yes.  Please come in.
Do you believe that?
It's possible.
I hope not.
A dime.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
That's exactly what I told myself.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
American currency.
This will take some time.
I have all day.
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Never heard of K-MART?
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
It's big, right Jahn?
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
I thought that was part of the charm!
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Well, don't get carried away.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
'cause you stink of booze.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Like helping a sick kid?
We're going to need it all.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Why don't we go together?
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
No, not yet.
You're all bloody useless.
What?
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
She's cool.
A fine specimen for conversion.
What are you on about?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
You're kidding.
Lucky break!
Siberia.
You're sure?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Yes.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
What?
Don't worry it's okay!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
Fernet and tonic.
No.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
Thanks.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
But we could go to London and live in England.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Yep, it's all yours.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
What is bail?
Thanks.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
What's the Bugler?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
We_re not all running away
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Uh-huh!
Cool!
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
It was the biggest I could find.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Yeah.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Well come on, sit down.
Why?
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Can we talk in your office?
Yes, if you can get him free.
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
You are quite sure it's secure?
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Some Americans?
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Heart be still.
I do.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
About a job.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
I could take after Dad, too.
I meant he's a doctor.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
Demented.
-- Obviously.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Like me.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
It's private.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Could be...
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
In ten words or less?
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
You don't believe in anything?
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
Yes. And?
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Then maybe you can read mine.
That sounds like horseshit.
Prove it.
I don't want to be just your friend --
And why would that scare me?
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
I wanted this to be a date.
I have to get you home by one.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
We're doing something -- ?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Where?
Hoped for it.
Sure.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
That what you do?
Yes. I try to keep my power.
No.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
Anything you want.
Tired.
Lower. Same page.
Dad --
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Yes, sir.
No.
Materially or spiritually?
Either. Both.
I thought she built it herself.
Where did you get -- ?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What do you want, Biff?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
Yes, sir!
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
But he didn't ask me.
But he does! Don't you see?
The drill!  The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.
Learn anything?
Okay, then!
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Why?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Run out of gas?
What?
What year?
Pro! Release the rope!
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
Then where the hell is he?
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
So what? We'd be rich!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Ssshhhhh!
Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
Oh, yeah.
The power converter...
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
You were ringing the doorbell!
What if you lost your keys?
You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
Curious... Very curious....
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
What did you do to yours?
Gone?... Where?
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Yeah.
No, he showed me one.
Okay.
He never bit me.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Yeah.
Okay.
Jack.
Yeah. I can imagine.
No.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
It's your play.
What?
But it would hurt.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
I don't know.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Excuse me.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Yeah.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
Who're you?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
Let her out. In my custody.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Go away.  Let me rot?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Pretty terrible shot.
It's kinda hard this way.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Go where?  Where're you going?
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
A what?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Pictures don't lie.
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Bet I do.
...I know this must look... funny.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
What. What don't I understand?
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
Drown all those rascals...
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
Chet! From downstairs!
Garland, it's me.
A week, eight, nine days 
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
Are you all right?
Who?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
You thought! Where'd you get THAT from?  You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash  strike that, a lot of cash.
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Pictures! Jesus!
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
And I could tell you some stories 
Seen a doctor?
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Hi, Charlie.
You're leaving?
Hold on 
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Yeah, but Charlie 
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
I apologize, Barton.
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
The others are being sent.
Yeah.
He's a little funny in the head.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
All of which he's now missin'.
Physician, heal thyself.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
Give you nose bleeds?
...Fred...
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Bring 1976 up.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
Thank you.
She said what you said she'd say.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
Nilsen.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What was she like in school?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Tell me about Catherine.
I had him in two classes.
Put your hands up!
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
Were you with him last night?
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I quit.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
I'd like to ask you some, too.
Didn't you study it in school?
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Do you?
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
What's it about?
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
No.
To see if I can get away with it.
Fine.  How's your back?
I know.
Why?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
Funny.
No.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
How did it end?
No.
Why would I need an attorney?
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
Were there ever any suspects?
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Thanks.
What are you doing here, Pop?
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.  One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
I know what that's like.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
I feel fine!
Why the hell not?
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
What was it?
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
Fuck you, too Nick.
What about me?
No.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
Yes I did.
No. Should I have?
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I haven't decided yet.  Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
Of what?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Ignorant art?
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You name it, I paint there.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Decipher?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Really?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Willie Mays.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Who's John Henry?
Hi Gina.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Guess I just got sick of him.
Can I walk you home?
Party girls? Can I call you?
Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
You're back.
Basquiat, what did you take?
Well thanks!
Don't you think he's using you?
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar  I'll get the rest.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
My point exactly.
What time is it?
5:11.
I can't. After the show.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
I need this?
Uh-oh!
No, actually I feel worse.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's."  You --
Hanging on every word.
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I'm listed.
I'm tempted.
Oh.  "Kyle."
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Yeah?  Me too...
"We"?  You and...
And the truth frightened her?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
No.  No glass on the inside.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Your blood, Max.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
Too good?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Thanks.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Yes?
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Keep it.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Hey, what's your problem?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
I'm afraid to ask.
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I can make it.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Can he save her?
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
Just the beast.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Maybe he melted.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
Dear daisy, don't despair.
Where is my wife?
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
I've got to stop him.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
Our work?
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
Hardly a worry, sir.
Apology hastily retracted.
Is he all right?
He ran away?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
...Afraid.
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Recognition, of course.
And another name for Mystery?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Al?
Master Wayne's dead wives.
Just checking, young sir.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Exactly!
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Nostrovia.
Slanta.
Wacko? That a technical term?
That's usually my line.
Excuse me.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Well, I met someone...
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Fred?
...You gonna kill me?
What say we flip for it?
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
A man with a death wish.
You're a genius.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
The small one.
... Very good, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
... Murderer...
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
... A hundred and eight?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
I'll take you with me.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
As far as I know.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
No.
Odd desire for anyone.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Finding out where she is.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
Is that what you "heard"?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
... Behind the makeup?
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Oh, Bruce...
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
You okay?
There aren't hotels?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
And what did you say?
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
oh dear.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Great news.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
I beg your pardon?
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Er ... pray tell me why?
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Quite right, sir.
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure.  You're right.
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
What's gone?
What's your problem Beavis?
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives. Huh huh huh.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
You mean there's mre than one?
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Heh heh, thanks.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cut the power!
Deep and hard.
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
We're rich in what really matters.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
How's your arm?
Two hours.
That's how long you were gone.
... Hmmm?
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
This is going to take some time.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Then it should be here.
He might have hurt somebody.
I didn't --
Let's see if she can get my model back.
All right.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
We were trying to scare your mother.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Really.  I don't know.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
We're practicing.
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
No, wait!
I want to be dead too.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
They're dead.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
He's your cousin.
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
Otho'll know what to do.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
I'm lonely.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
I'm sorry already.
I thought I saw something.
Gooood!
Oh, as long as we're here...
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
I don't know.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
I see.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
No, Robert.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Thank you, Robert.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Thank you.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Yes. I am.
Oh? Certainly...
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Yes.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
I am a very good gardener.
Hello, Eve.
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
... Mentor...?
Yes. I was.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Hello, Dennis.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Hello, Morton.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
I don't want Robert.
I agree.
How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
So you know Krylov!
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
Yes. I am very hungry.
And I'm Ben.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes. That is correct.
No, Ben.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
A flower...
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Oh. Thank you.
Good day, Sally.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... Yes. You can take me.
... Good evening, Louise.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes.
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
No. I don't object.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Compensated...?
How were you paid?
I was given meals, and a home...
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
... In the garden?
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Sid, it's useless!
You heard?
Do you feel well enough for that?
That's good... That's good.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
It's not that, I just...
Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No problem, Chief.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
No, sir.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Yes, I did.
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
I don't know.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
The monkey.
May 11th.
I was worried.
The ferret?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
No they're not.
Us, of course.
Me and John.
Shut up!
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
The monkey.
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Forget it.
Yex?
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
No.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Thank you, sir.
You're insane.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Why not?
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Who told you?
Who told you?
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
Yeah. But enough about me.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
No. Don't be an ass.
A scary dream?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Good morning, Lotte!
Do you?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
When?
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I love you, Lotte.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Is there dancing?
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
I likes yellow.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Don't pay to complain.
Yes?
She gone like they say?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Yes sir
I will.
May I come in?
What you want?
Oh.
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am..
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I miss her.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Ya think?
Be here. In case.
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Extra?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
She likes this dress...
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Oh I been out.
The church!
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
He knew Baby Suggs?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
For what?
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
You planning to do anything about it?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Paul D.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Make it the way I always do.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Her life is in your hands.
Oh, man, don't say that..
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
The?  Who the fff--
Yeah, it sucks.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Yeah, but we're--
And this guy peed on it.
I am the Walrus.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
It's already posted.
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Am I wrong?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Are these.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
And was there anything of value in the car?
And what do you do, sir?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
You're not interested in sex?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Take a look at this, sir.
He fixes the cable?
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Oh?
What do you do for fun?
Finder's fee?
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
But he's--
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
What the fuck are you--
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
What the fuck are you--
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
MARK IT ZERO!
Well, just take 't easy, man.
What if it's during a game?
I told him if it was during league play--
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
It's your roll--
It's your roll.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
What the fuck?
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Uzi?
Walter, please--
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
Walter--
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
But Walter--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Thanks Walter.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Uh-huh.
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Yeah?
Shit yeah!
Huh?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah, and you were--
You know this!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
Hey, cool it Walter.
It's a heart attack.
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
You're a fuck, Walter!
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
...Us? DUDE
Yeah?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Employed?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Fuckin' A.
I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
The House of Pain.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
Nothing.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
I don't understand.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Did you think I wouldn't?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Where the hell have you been?
Blood...
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Nomak?
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Scud.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
Wait.
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're wrong.
Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
You're blind --
There are other ways to see. Sit.
But I just got here --
You've been here longer than you think.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
It worked, didn't it?
The way they move, they way they smell --
Like me.
You get used to the darkness.
For your miracle cure?
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
How long have we been driving?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
What are you talking about?
There's only one alternative to the serum.
No problem.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
Perhaps.
What happens then?
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
But you use blood banks --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
How?
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
Hey, folklore--
Join the club.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
What do you mean?
Nick!!
Yes.
Trying to find the energy.
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
Christ.
--Christ almighty--
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
So whoever built this--
Not the only things missing, Nick.
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
--whatever; that's her.
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
<u>Yes</u>.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Why is there no "our" here?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
Then I'm going--
Why?
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
--no, I think they're all in there.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
Turn the tapes back on.
Fine.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
Four in the morning?
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
--I don't know.
Goes right along with these two.
The wheel.
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Enough to keep sane.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Why?
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
What?
No. I don't think so.
And what's your excuse for being here?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
Still working on it.
Elly Kedward?
Sure. I'm sorry.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
She's off her fucking rocker--
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
She's far from "fine."
Does she, goddamnit??
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--the Sheriff's Office--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
I am?
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
Abby...
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
I just gotta see a guy.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
Yeah? What happened?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
I don't know. I better get off now.
Abby--
I said you're bad.
Yeah...
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Marty.
I don't follow baseball.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Yeah...
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
...Hell.
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Yeah.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
What do you mean...
Got a job for you.
You're an idiot.
Yeah...
Nah, I trust ya.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Don't throw that out.
What's the point?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
What?
Okay honey.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. cheers.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Only you. and the photo lab.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Baby wants to fuck.
Frank?
Yes, but.
Then, shut up!
Can I feel 'em?
Alright, suit yourself.
Shit. You better tell me something.
No.
I'll go then.
Yes, I like you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Who's it, you mean.
Don?. Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Yes.
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Sure I do.
Whatiya mean?
Shut up.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
I think I better go.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
On a ride.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
What?
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Good, let's drink up.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yes.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Now, how are you going to do that?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yes. I do.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
You like mysteries that much?
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay. great!
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
... You look beautiful.
I can't dance fast.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Dorothy Vallens?
It's good to see you, Dad.
Good deal Dad.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
What?
Nothing. I'm fine.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah. okay.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
I'll get a coat for her.
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
You'll see for yourself.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
It's garbage.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Yes, I am.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
We want some grass.
No.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
It's your grass.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Yeah.  She told me.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
For calling you a homo.
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
I need you to go to Miami.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Try the closet.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
What?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Actually, it was three.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Yes.
It's beautiful.
I want money.
Family.
Keep them coming.
And Diego?
Diego is my brother.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I know.
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
I'm going to California.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I know.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
You're not going to trial?
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Figured what out?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
I like fire.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
I said, I've seen it before.
Out.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
What's happening to us?
Well, here I am.  See?
How are you doing?
You swear?
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
Stoned?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
The strike is a success; but ...
And you believe the NLF?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Don't move, Hacene.
What's happened to you?
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Here?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
A name?
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Why?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
An inquiry into what?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
No.
Yes.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What was the nature of the argument?
Could you be more specific?
Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
No.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Thank you.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
What about Miss Lawson?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yeah.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
And how are you now?
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.  It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted.  A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had handcuffed me to the bed.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
What happened after that?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Cocaine.
No.
Yes.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No.
I was angry.
No.
No.
No.
We dated for about a month last year.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
No.
That bastard!
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Dristan nasal spray.
A.M -- or P.M.?
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
You still haven't answered my question.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
No pain, no gain?
Something like that.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Sure.  Where to?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I'm the photographer.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Yes -- she did.
You and me -- making love.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Of course.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
No -- you're not.
That wasn't the deal.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
She's waiting in the conference room.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
She allegedly humped him to death?
Yeah.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
No, Your Honor.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
I am relaxing.
Really.
If you want me to.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
We have to talk.
Yes.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
It had to get there somehow.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
Well, I can help.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
What problem?
Michael.
What?!
Come here a minute.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
What?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
No. We're going to lock this up and --
STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Not yet. You want to go?
I never knew that.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
She changed.
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Oh, that'll be nice.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Want another cigarette?
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Is the dizziness gone?
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
Why did you stop?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
No.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Sure.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
How about Italy?
How about Bari?
Yes.
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
I sat outside and had coffee.
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
No.
Well, what is this?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
No one's asking you to!
WHY?
Yeah. It could get better.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Hmm?
What's she like?
Okay.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
He yours, sir?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Died there?  How?
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
Just some flies.
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
Damned if I know.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
What?
Where we'll always be...
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
We met.
Then fuck it!!!
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Please.  It's for your own good.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
Why?
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Patrick, he's...
Let me see it.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
From what?
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
What building?
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
You was just doing your job.
Now you.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Not that I remember.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
Evidence of what?
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You want to get into this now?
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Know what?
You don't need a key.
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
There's no time.
It couldn't have been.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Violet, I won't let you leave.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
What?  How about a drink?
Why?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Me?  Why?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
Yeah.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Leave your phone on the hook.
All right.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
'63 Chevy.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Caesar is your husband?
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
Thanks.
What do you want?
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
No.
He's a launderer?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
What the fuck was it?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
He was in love with you, right?
For what?
You think I'm lying?
I think ...
What?
To let it dry.
Does the case lock?
Johnnie?
Yeah.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
okay, all right.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
How'd it go?
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Hey, Johnnie ...
Caesar wants me to stay.
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this.
I don't know what we're talking about.
I thought you were never going to do that.
Forget it.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
Treadstone?
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
So now you know.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Right.
Sir, you waited on line.

Paris?
Yes.
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
His brother.  You know his brother?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
I hadn't heard.

I need a ride out of here.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
What does that mean?
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?

What are you talking about?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
We're about an hour away.
I guess.
Jason...
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
...omigod, no...
-- just --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
Oh, Jesus...
-- how? --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
Nykwana Wombosi. 
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
I'm sorry.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
So now you're asking for a student visa?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
What's that?
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
I tried.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
<u>Where am I</u>?
I don't remember Zurich.
I don't know.
... fix themselves.
... have a look.
...Yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
...sod you, stupid twit.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
What? How do you know my name?
What do I have to do.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
In fact, killing people -
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Well, I ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Jack!
Long time no see!
Even later.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Mr Helpmann!
Ah ...
What?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
How much do you know?
Enough though, eh?
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Tell me about Layton.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
So what are you going to do about her?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Bastard!!!
What?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Information Adjustments.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Please!
Oh, sorry.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What?
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
What parcel?
Well, all wars do -
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Let go! We've got to stop!
Oh God! What have we done?
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Information Retrieval.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Next of kin!
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
I delivered it.
Yes.
What's the matter?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I never signed the form.
What! Shit!
It's what you wanted isn't it?
What?
A woman eh? I see.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
You're not listening, mother.
What is it?
Mother!
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
I want to talk to him.
What have you done with his body?
Um ...
I ... uh ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Er, don't you want to search me?
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Emergency procedures.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
But ... I called Central Services.
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
What do they want you or?
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
Es impossible.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
No!
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Ten-four.
No. He's dead.
What's his name?
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
Sure, sure, give go.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
He's dead, huh?
No.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
He's better, though, right?
He's better.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
You asked me not to come.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
There's no time.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
Thanks.
I need a drink, that's all.
What do you think?
The family know?
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
A medical miracle.
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
The brakes are shot.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Faster!
Relax, will you.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
You've made my dreams silly.
Keep it to yourself.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
You have the job you have...
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
Okay.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
It's not loaded.
And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
That's your full name?
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Sure.
I'd give anything if that were true.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Did you bring your grey suit?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
You too.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Speaking.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Yes.
No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Outside?
Yeah --
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
No.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
I'll never tell.
And Bobbie says...
Yes.
Should I...
You talked me into it.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Anchor?
...good-bye then.
I'll speak to you.
No.  Not even you.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
I was a lot earlier.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Okay.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
Excited.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Okay.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Yes.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
That's not it.
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
I know.  I taped it.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  Good night.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Then you should stay here.
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Through the closet.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
I'm going home!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Oh it's enough...
Anything new?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
He made a cat.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Let's see it.
Oh...
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Walter!  Jeez!
Yes Walter.
All about me...
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
No! I want to talk about it now!
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Nothing...nothing at all.
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Didn't you hear him?
What is it, your laundry?
I said I did, didn't I!
Sure!
A parakeet?
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Have a seat -
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Yeah, why?
Just wait till you see this!
Put it down, Walter.
Uh, hi.
Uh, sure.
C-connection?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
I ain't going no place with you!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Good morning Walter!
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
I had him in my grasp.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
What's with you?
Wrong answer!  No prize.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
We hate you guys!
You didn't like them.
I'm hungry.
Wheels?
My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Something like that.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.
Hi.
I do?  I guess I do.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
I'm here with Jenny.
Didn't you get my message?
You left me a message?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Water.  Okay.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Merrick...
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?
In Virginia.
All right.  What do we do now?
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Skip it.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Sporting events, yeah.
Who we gonna beat?
My nails.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You are such a wet.
Vampires of the world, beware.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
He knows who I am!
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
I guess.
B'bye.
You're having a fling with him?
Oh.
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
I'm just a girl.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Could be.
Could be.
Good.
Okay, what else?
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Does Jeffrey know?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Right!
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Except for Prom.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You said "Crash".
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Which nostril am I breathing through?
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
It's all the same thing.
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
I know what it is.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
What a nasty thing to say.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
That's great!
I won't be needing these anymore.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
G'night.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
Let me.
You got me all confused.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
He won't make love to me anymore.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
What?
What's it say?
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Oh let's not...
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Never heard of 'em.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
I didn't spit on you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Beg me again!
I thought I was--
But he ain't seen my heat--
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Let go of me!
What?
Love to--
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
We're getting married.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
Struck out eighteen...
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Okay...
It's a damn convention.
Check it out.
Where does he go?
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
That's right.
You were wandering around.
Philip, if you would rise.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Wait, hold on a second.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
Lester...
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
702 472 1862.
That's right.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
Four aces, Doc.
No.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Nope, there's no way.
Listen...
Yeah?
You lost your control.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
Listen, I would -
It's none of my business?
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
What people?
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Sammy.
It's me.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
And they were usually right.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Ace, listen to me.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
We can't get rid of him?
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Oh, no.
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
Okay. 
See you, Ginger.
Thanks a lot.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Yeah.
I'm not crying. 
Oh, it's so soft.
Oh...
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Oh, fabulous.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Why do you need that much?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
No, he didn't.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
Yeah, how do I know?
Okay.
Okay, okay.
No, you don't.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
What do you mean?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Right.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
I gotta tell ya...
How serious?
...twenty-five thousand?
...the rest of the two million is still there?
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
With Jennifer.
What'd you have?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Why do you want to do that?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Oh...
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
You want your jewelry?
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I am not!
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
A record of the arrests...
Ye-yeah.
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
...I got muscled on the street.
Mm.
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
Shut your mouth!
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
You gotta go back out there.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Sam?
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
I can't.
Hey!
Okay.
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
Uh-huh.
Oh, thanks, Eddy.
Fine, fine.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Am I right?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
What? What?
I don't - 
Let me think about that.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Everything went to his head. 
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
It's what you want?
All right. Be careful.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
But I saw something...
Thank you. Very nice.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Yes.
No, Lester.
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
I just talked to him.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
'Go! Go! Go!'
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
You're driving me nuts!
Listen...
They check in alone?
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
Incredible.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
She asleep?
But he never talked.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
So are we.
Let's get out of here.
Go fuck yourself.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
How you doin'?
Denying?
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman -
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
I know, but that's enough.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
No it's not.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
It may be time to get the police involved...
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Wha-at?
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
"Well done," Cactus.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Ask me another one--
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
Uh. "Thanks?"
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
I actually got some memory back last night.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
Actually, yes.
What?
Nothing. How's your hand?
You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.
Uh-huh..
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
You could've made me lose my call.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
It's taken care of.
And stop with the directions.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
Allow me.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Any minute.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
I don't believe you.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
What do they need her for?
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Our house always needs touching up.
Pictures.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
Great.  Stay with me.  There must be a hundred kids out here.
What bank?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Do you know what's in that box?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
What's going on?
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
You can't give up.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
What did you do?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
You're all three of you in that van?
Yes sir.
Put the man back on.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I can't do it.
Yes.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
You knew about me.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
What's your point?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
That's not good enough.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
You mustn't hang up.
Didn't we play this scene before?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Pass.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
What time frame have you got in mind?
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
I wish it had never been invented.
It's your call.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
I don't know what you mean.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
You should've done all this before.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
I won't let 'em.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
The fuck I will!
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Take the 405 south.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
I thought so.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
So who's he?
She's not a girl, Col --
He gave me a look.
What you think?
I would expect he does.
Ask him yourself.
Hi.
Stop it, Dil --
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
What?
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Bloody right I do...
Who?
What's his name?
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
Half-five. At Millie's.
Must be.
How special?
You want one?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Whiskey.
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
Didn't think I could.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Tell him it hurt --
What you doing here?
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Must be.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Stop it, Jimmy.
A little.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Delirious.
Don't.
No.
Not here.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
You could say that.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
It's a secret.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
I promise.
I'm sorry.
You like me better like this.
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
Yes.
What condition?
Died...
I like you, DIl
Then say it.
Anything.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Will I see you again?
Meet Col --
Stop it, Dil --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Can't.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No, what is the thing?
You're never out, Fergus.
You know what. Go.
And what if you don't?
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Why?
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
I thought it was Dave.
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I know that.
I understand.
Right.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
What is it now?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
She your wife?
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You could have said no.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Never.
I'll bear that in mind.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Yeah?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
Why?
Doesn't matter where.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Who's Dil?
The best.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
Depends on what you believe in.
Yes.
What?
Take her picture. C'mere.
I'm sorry.
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Like the one about the frog?
Yeah?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
What does that mean?
Tell me something, anything.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
You won't run.
What you say, faster?
Got to catch me first --
What?
You don't know me, do you?
You didn't?
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Nice lady.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
I think that's what you ordered.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
What?
What about it?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
It's all right -- look.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Well -- come on.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Open up.
Lord, you're stubborn.
I love you, Adam.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
With whom? Where?
Of course there is!
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I heard you, I heard you.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
But --
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Agents.
Describe him.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
That's the spirit.
Oh. Then who's this one?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
Very good.
No.
The last one, please.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
Starting with his own.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Open it.
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
Reggie?
Why you lied to me.
I met a man with sharp nails.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
There -- you're a new man.
You can't.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Said what?
What are you doing?
You did.
That sounds like their problem.
Tuesday.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Yes, I know.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
The shower's in there.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
I dare you.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
You mean, you're a thief?
I'm afraid it is important.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
And if it is?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
What do you want?
Tell me what?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I'm very confused.
Swiss.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I wish you wouldn't.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
And this? And this?
We won! We won!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Quitter.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Please, not on my account.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Charles is.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
Starting tonight?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
How about once more around the park?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
What?
A quarter of a million dollars.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
How do you know what they're doing?
Words can hurt very much.
Yes?
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Oh la vache!
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
I never fucked Rod.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
You're grounded Friday night!
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
I want you to head right home after school.
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
How much further?
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
Who is she Daddy?
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
Run!
No?
Are you sure?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
St. Michael's.
I can.
Who's?
Ok.
What?
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Then you should go.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
I really do. For your own safety.
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
You're the killed.
Why?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
OK. increase the peace.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Why?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
They're not picking me up until six.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Yeah. Who is she?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Attacked how?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
You're not telling me something.
The principal?
I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
I'm worried about someone.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
But you don't really mean it.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
That wasn't me ...
At least somebody likes this shit.

Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Uh, huh?
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
 No.

...and a shitload of ice.
For cryin' out loud.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
All right, then how about this?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
It happens to this piece of shit...
Oh, man.
Am I missing somethin' here?
Fine. 
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Take your gun!
What?
Doesn't...
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!

 Nice job back there.
...I'm not the psycho.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
You wanna hit me?
 Yeah...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
All right, you got it.

  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
I think...

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!

...wanna give it a try!
Come on, old...
Come on...

You okay?
Gee, you think so?
 Okay.  That didn't work.
Shut up!

 
 Shit. 
 Go on.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.

All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.

Yeah, he's a dangerous...
You're--?  What?!
No!
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
You're fucked, man.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
...overdrawn bank accounts.
...truck.
 Yeah.
We were nationally  ranked.
How wonderful for you.
We got two paddles.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
Yeah.
...deal with this asshole.
A-And you  owe me...
Yeah, I know, I know.
Hey!

Put your hand in my pants.

But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
No.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
That's right.
Hey, be cool.

Well, well, well.

And it won't be pleasant.

I had no idea how powerful it was.

  Hey, actually...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.

Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...

Heat's murder.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
They're calling it an accident.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
How did you find out?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
With her mother.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Haven't the faintest idea.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
What are you talking about?
Oh they don't?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Curly, where's your car?
Off the alley.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
I'm not.
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
The apple core club.
The apple core?
How do they do that?
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
Summer colds are the worst.
How'd you get past the guards?
I get by.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.
No.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
And why's that?
They only dump the water at night.
Where?
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
No.
A complete surprise?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
A private investigator?
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
I don't want to drop it.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
I was grateful.
Why?
You mean you don't know where you were?
Yes... why?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
Of course I'm sure.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Know him?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
What were you doing there?
What about it?
Where are you going?
He owns it. You know?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
It's possible.
The police?
She's not tied up!
What about?
You're insane.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
What are you saying?
She's my sister.
To Mexico...
Back to Mexico.
I'm all right.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh no.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
The obituary column?
You'll find one of those people.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
Only when I breathe.
I never was.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes...
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Si.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Yeah.
Mr. Gittes...
I am sorry.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Yeah, I'll do that.
Yes.
Yeah.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
They're all a bunch of phonies.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Neither do I.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
That's for sure.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Come in, Alfredo.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
What's she like? What's she like?...
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
No, nobody came. 
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
I can't take shorthand.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
I might make him nervous.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Who said anything about brooms?
Charlie?!
That looks pretty nice.
Yes.
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Yes.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Are they standing for me?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Is it good?
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Of course.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
Emily!
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
It can wait.
I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
What's the matter with you?
In the water.
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Oh, me -
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Half past eleven.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
No, you're not.
Don't go, Susan.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
I see! 
Where'm I going?
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Yes, sir.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Charlie!
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
Why is she leaving me?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
That's the train with all the lights.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Yes and no.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I had a toothache.
He married you, didn't he?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Rosebud?
Are you sure?
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Dick.
So where is he?
God, isn't he great?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Awww. That was so cute.
I feel nauseous.
Train. It took eight hours.
Very dramatic, I thought.
No.
But you were.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
I just told you.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
Excuse me?
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
Lenin's Tomb.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Bunch of savages in this town.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
You win.
Five years.
Eight and a half.
Eight and a half?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
What do you mean?
That girl was vile to you.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
You think things would be any different now?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
I guess.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Wait.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
There aren't.
The milkmaids.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
FUCK!
I know.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Don't yell at me, pal.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Gatorade.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
You hardly knew her!
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
I swear.
No!
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
I don't want to talk to you.
Let me borrow your car.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
Exactly.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Living proof.
I'm happy.
Now I know you're lying.
You're kidding.
I'm not.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Fuck you.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Oh, like your life's any better?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What time did you get to work today?
Like ten after.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
I'll call you. Let you know.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Jesus Christ, what next?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
Yeah.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
I should start.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
You used to go out with her?
Veronica.
Lasagne.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
She's my girlfriend.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Yeah, but...
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Here. Now leave me alone.
I hate this fucking place.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Why did you agree to come in then?
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
I was kidding.
I touched a nerve.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Who?
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Let it go...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
A few?
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
And that made you feel better?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
It was only a few times...
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
It stings a little.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Can I have your name please?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
He's your cousin?
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
I like the way you think.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
You'll be missed.
How long you gonna be here?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
He didn't ask me to...
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Bye  That was Snowball.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
A monkey?
It can't fly in this weather.
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
Okay--I don't know about this.
Can I count as fast as I like?
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Where've you been?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Jess--you look good.
Hal knows what he's doing.
You mean the nerve.
Can't do it.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
How'd you get up here?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
You got to go back now!
You know me, I'm a night person.
I can't believe you just said that.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Cute.
Breathtaking.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Don't let me fall!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I won't do it.  No way.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Forget it!  I refuse!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
It looks like a winding route.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Kill him when he gets down.
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
No names, this is an open line!
Get off the radio!
Appreciate it.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Thank you, sir.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Well, how are you then?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
I wanna be sick.
Let me get up.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Blue eyes?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Lice?
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
How're you feeling this morning?
Fine... fine.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
But it was horrible.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. I'm glad
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting.
I've done my best, have I not?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Yeah... Pete the English.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Four in this block, sir.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
Like what?
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Oh, my, yes.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Sorry?
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
I think...
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Can you finish on schedule?
Wouldn't dream of it.
So?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
What's he sayin'?
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Maaaaaax!
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
An apology.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You prefer nights?
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
You should start a union.
Why not?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Like what?
Max.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
You're cool.
No.  You say you're cool.
With what?
Did I stutter?  The trunk.  Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Okay, try it now.
I think so.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Yes.
Play music.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
What?
People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  And for <u>you?</u> You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be.
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
It's not bullshit.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Doesn't cover everything.
Why?
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Makes two of us.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
What'd they do?
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
What happened to you?
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
Slow down!
Any special reason?
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
Why the hell not?
You turned up a one way street!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mississippi?
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not for years.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
I'll see you tomorrow.
For what?
You saved my life.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
I have no idea.
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
You got a list?
Who?
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
So what's the question?
Please put it down.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Realized what?
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
You will?
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Then tell me what happened.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
They'll trace it.
You knew just what I was there for.
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  <u>Now</u>.
Now she tells me.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I'm leaning toward no.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Whatever.
And you have no idea where he lives?
<u>Why you</u>?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
This doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
And Jonas?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
You're --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Oh?  How's he doing?
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No doubt.
Ellie...
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ellie.
Good luck, David.
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Okay, okay... there.
Okay.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Can you show me?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So we passed some kind of test?
Can you help us?
Now... you go home.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
It's so... small.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Mmm.  Look closer.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Make that two.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
I don't think so.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I don't follow.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
It's late.  We should go back.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
What are you so afraid of?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
In other words.
But --
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
Git your shovel and git to work.
But I made this arrangement --
Buck is a deal.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Ram it in and break it off!
You don't know!
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
You jes' watch us!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
'Bout two hours left.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
I just always did like truck rides.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Cool Hand Luke.
That's it. That's the end.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Call.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Well, how far didya get?
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
How about you tryin' to make me?
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
About what?
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
You get me out first.
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
You come and visit.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Oh, I think you will.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
No.  Not yet.
I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
Would you want to work with us on this?
For months... last October.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
How do you know that?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
Then what do you need me for?
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
You're afraid of him.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
Maybe you should...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
They all have one...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Okay.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Oh, I know.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Let's get out of here...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
Talk to Nikko...!
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
You're damn right I do.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Because I think I'm wrong.
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Nikko?
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
Thank you.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
Do you find him attractive?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
I work in the immigration department there.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
You could get your wish at any moment.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
What?
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
I don't want to hear anymore.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
What?
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
It'll be fine.
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
I didn't say...
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Come on.
Wow.   Congratulations.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
I've already made arrangements.
A deal's a deal.
Don't be fresh.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
No.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Enough with the abracadabra.
The left one.
A small price.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Exactly.
No rounds for another three hours.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
What's my rap?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
So, it's over?
List schmist. You'll remember.
Really?
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
I think I should call someone.
It's hard to know where to start.
Well then why'd it happen?
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
I mean tonight.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
I don't feel like going to work today.
No, it's not like that.
Yes.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
That's a load off my mind.
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
What?
Michael.   Yes.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
I'm glad you're doing well.
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Where are the tapes?
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Where did they go?
It's me...
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Oui.
Take what you've got and get out of there.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Uh, no --
But you were there?
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
And the other half?
I only have your word for that.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
No problem.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
And the Vodka.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
Good idea.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
You haven't answered my question.
Does it really matter what I say?
I will.
What do you want now?
Don't bullshit me.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I've got a way with people.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
How much?
-- Did you set it up?
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
What'd they take?
Okay boss.   Where are they?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Good song though.
And the other car?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Go look.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Oh yeah.
You can use my car.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What is it you do, Sami?
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
What the hell is he talking about?
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Mr. Taylor?
Yeah.   It's mine.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
How?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
No thank you.
Yeah, I dig him.
Watch this.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
And you don't speak French?
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
What does arresting us get them?
Take a nap.
Something like that.
The lucky ones.
No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
A car.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I'll go and make up his room!
I didn't have the heart.
Let's go!
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I have a guest.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're too young to understand.
You're a sword fighter too?
You're not married, are you?
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
They forced me to marry!
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Come and get it if you can.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Kneel!
Never!
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Give it back.
I will.
Don't ever come back.
Make a wish, Lo.
Good.  And how are you?
Fine.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
You were enlightened?
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
Perhaps.
What have you discovered?
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
Did you see who posted it?
Have you questioned him yet?
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
I'll look around and catch up later.
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
We followed Jade Fox.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
What does it say?
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
I don't know...
But the sword could be in his compound.
This is a delicate matter.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
I'm buying.
They make you fart.
Annie, I need a file.
No further.  I'm serious.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
You don't say.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
I should be trying to stop you.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
It's just the dope, don't worry
I dabble.  May I?
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
A remembrance.  A closure.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Elly...
Mom tried to cook.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
Shelly?
Leave me alone -- !
Fine with me.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Move in, guys.
Who got himself what?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
What do you mean?
Okay...
No.
Oh really?
How do you know I've been with several women?
The Fountainhead.
You need help.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Because you act like a pig.
How are you today?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I said I was sorry.
That's also none of your business.
Yes.
What?
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
How was your date?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
You must take me for a real idiot.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
I can't win with you.
Fine.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Good for you.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
Sure.
What are you saying?
I love you.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
- none taken -
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
I don't think that bothered him.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
It was nothing.
What are you saying?
Is it that obvious?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Why didn't you do something?
I don't know.
No.
Well what then?
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
I swear.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You do?
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
Baby?  Right on time.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
You told her I never said I love you before?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Yes!
I'm pretty sure she did.
I'll be in touch.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
What do you mean?
I'll be right there.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
You don't mean?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
And if I win?
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
I'm working on it.
Call me later.
Okay.
Shhh.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Interesting.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
But who will they turn to for help?
Oh sis. You're so tense.
I'm aware.
Take a look for yourself.
Yeah.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
So? How'd it go last night?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Where'd she go?
Kind of.
It clearly is why.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Come again?
Didn't you hear what I said?
And if I don't?
I'll do my best.
Excuse me.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Annette! Annette!
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I did?
Did she show up?
Don't worry about it.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
Did your wishes ever come true?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
At the old house with the voice.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
That's the Farren house.
But I told her to go with you.
But wishes don't come true.
Certain wishes do.
It was on account of the birthday party.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But...
I don't know yet.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I shall want you for always.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
The numbers simply don't mean anything
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
You wanted to share this moment with me.
But she's dead!
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
But why?
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
That's a fine-looking ring.
It's a pretty ring.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
That's the clever way to do it.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
That means I can go alone?
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But what happened to the little deer?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Who is she?
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Why hasn't he got a head?
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Yes...yes, that's true.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
It's not just in my head.
How have you been feeling?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Anything's better than Mark.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
At least your PMS is over.
My vision got worse again.
I wonder if he's married.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
What the hell is the tampon test?
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I've been here. What day is it?
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Ignore it.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Check out what I found.
What choice do we have?
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
No. I won't let you do that.
About Benito.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Well, whattdaya think?
That's great. Highly original.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Since when do you care?
Yeah right... You better go.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
My bra is my biggest supporter.
On your desk.
A little.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
Intriguing?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Oh, it's nothing.
It's stupid.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Goodnight.
What are they for?
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
What happened?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
Interesting possibility.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
We didn't have sex.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
No, I said it was our first date.
What makes you think I was the last one?
No, I have a cat.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
You're some catch Lloyd.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
He's seriously disturbed...
Loose ends?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
I didnt requisition a secretary.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Shut-up.
I don't know who they are.
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
What is that door?
Which one?
No.  Have a look.
Where does it lead?
Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
Water?
Yes.
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
Well...
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
I have to go...
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
They're dead, John.
No more than the usual.
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
You're kidding?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
I'm... not... nobody...
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Exactly. A condition.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
What do you mean, he's clean?
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
Are you threatening me?
Jesus...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
It's fine.
The government
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Choices?
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
That'd be great.
Really?   Crazy?
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
What?
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Does it make the cars any better?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
You know.  Your first campaign.
Oh.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
No... They don't kid.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
What's wrong with a magic trick?
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Oh... Yeah.
You weren't in the state legislature.
I don't know.
They asked me to help.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
Just wait.
Yes.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
I know. I'm sorry...
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
What?
It's nice.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're doing our best, sir.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Then why did you come here?
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
The tunnel.
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Ain't no place safe.
Maybe.
We got a boat.
What?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What?
Come on. Let's go.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
God....damn you, Rhodes!
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
It's because of me.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
You know how many demerits we're talking?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
I'll tell you later.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
What?
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
Doing fine, sir.
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
That's not my fault.
Sure.
All right.  I'll second that.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
It does?  What?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
But, Chris...
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Dead Poets honor.
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
Courtyard?
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
Again!  Louder!
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Don't stop!
Okay.
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
I'm calling her!
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
I'll take him over mine.
What?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
A play, dummy.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
I guess.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Put more into it!
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
We have to make it to the third deck...
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
And where is our point of arrival?
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
How soon can we get up and running?
You hear that?
Jesus Christ lady...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Self sufficient...
Takes one to know one.
What?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
You don't take orders very well, do you?
This time, make an exception.
You ain't giving the orders here!
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Me??
No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
Joey...
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
How does an island sound to you?
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Nowhere...
Plans don't change...
Someone's back there.
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
John...
She fucked me too.
Yeah.
Nick's going?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
I'll get it! Where is it?
You're full of shit!
They did not!
It's gotta!
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
I know, but...
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
You are frightened, no?
Yeah.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Linda, yeah.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
Psst. Vince!
Not so good.
Worse since she talked to him.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
What?
What kind of beer would you like?
No.
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
Playing?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Well, where's he from?
Yeah.
You got it.
It's ahead, Vince.
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
No. No way!
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Here! This is it!
No!!!?
What do you mean, no???
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
What's that noise?
What?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Here. Behind you.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
Aw, it's a long story!
What's it for??
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
I can smell it.
What did you say?
Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
Not anymore.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
What the hell are you talking about?
Telephone repairman.
Ooops, I forgot.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Doucet killed my partner.
How do you know?
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
My insurance won't cover it.
Pass.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
You can't catch this man with a computer.
How then?
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
I was set up.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Good night, Wade.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
Yes, sir.
Then find me some cigarettes.
No, sir.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
How do I look?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
I'm signing off.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
What's it mean?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Of course I will.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Anybody can see that.
All right, darling.
But I like the new one better.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Sure am.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
What Grange?
Belle --
-- in gold.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
But what becomes of our souls?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
Well, I'll be -- 
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
The seventh day of April --
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Look here now--
I don't care.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Leave your tongue off of that!
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Well, I --
Morning, Jabez.
Yes.
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
How much?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Who is it?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Jabez --
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
All right, Jabez ...
Consarn the consarn --
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Hard luck -- like me.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
It don't matter!
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
You'll be a father any minute now.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
I won't forget.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
I'll do my best, Mary.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Cup for cup!
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
I can't be honest with them.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
Mind if I play some tunes?
That is Christmas music.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Who said we were terrorists?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Only if New Jersey counts.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
Sounds better than nothing.
Put it down now.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
I told you...
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
When you're hot, you're hot.
You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
Sure.  Follow me.
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Don't I always?
Holly Gennero?
So I've heard.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Uh, what do I call you?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
I'm here, cowboy.
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I still feel like shit.
Roy?
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Yeah.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
So... that sure is something.
What are you talking about?
That's it.
I like that... yeah!
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Yeah... yeah.
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Oh no!
You try calling the police?
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Who's this?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
They're okay.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Okay, give us the women.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
What do you want?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
You're full of shit ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Mulvaney...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?

What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
They look like good kids.
Are you a lawyer?
What now, Sonny?
No, not until after they killed him.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
No, that's all.
My body?  What for?
Let's go, Sonny.
What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
How'd that happen?
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
We're not there yet.
Wyoming.
Yeah ...
All right. 
Let's move it, goddamn it.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Bullshit!
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Okay, when do I get them?
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
What can he do, he's clean...
Gimme the black guy...
Okay.  Which one goes?
I am.
Open this up!
Yeah - it looks real official.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?

I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.

I don't like anything else.

So?
And?
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
What?
Ask Sal.
You the man.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
You're a drunk fool.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
I've done that before.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
How old are you?
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
What responsibilities?
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
He's completely innocent.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
Look at that.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Yes you did.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Can't do.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
C'mon, Sal.
Where we goin'?
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Mookie?
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Come in then.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
How long then?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.

Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
In the new library there.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Four colors? Neato!
HARRY Dunne.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
You did?
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Yeah...
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
What? No! Look.
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Well la de da.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I'm just not ready.
I don't follow.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The second R is silent.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Exactly! A pirate!
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
She did not.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Kids.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Don't look directly at him.
I didn't know that.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
You can't marry my mom.
Shut up!
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Hey, where did you come from?
I bet you want your head scratched.
I know I did.
Am not.
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
And like she said, do it before the parade.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Roger that, Wilco.
Okay. Which one do you want?
That's the one I wanted.
Try one in a million!
That's gross.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
No.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Not to expect you tonight.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You really are a pirate.
What are you talking about?
That's the downside. There is none.
He passed away three years ago.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Thanks, Pop.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
What?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
Yes you are. 
And I you.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
It's a surprise.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
Love it!
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
With your permission...
Nothing.
We felt his presence.
We are alone...
Yes.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Let him stand free!
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
Pain.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
Where?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
What can be done has been done.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?

You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Who do I play?
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Nah.  This happens all the time...
"It is my home."
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
So how'd we do?
"Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
Eddie, you screwed up.
Don't let me slow you down.
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Eddie, how was I?
Perfect.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
If you say so.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
This is the big moment...!
Ed, it was only one review.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
No!  A horror movie star!
Boris Karloff!?
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
Oh, just like in the script!
That's ridiculous.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
I understand you just moved here?
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
Yeah.  Exactly!
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
I like.  When do movie shoot?
But Greta say --
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Um, I guess --
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I got married last night.
Oh.  My condolences.
Oh, hi.
I am.  How's your father?
Not good...
What do you mean?
Oh.  Okay.
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
The sun.
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
You don't wanna be noticed?
You're <u>sure</u>???
That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
I do.
Mr. Wood!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
NOOOOO!!!
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Yeah. Ma...
Come on...
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
I want you to take this.
Um, yeah -- thanks.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Uh-huh?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Great line.
Ed --
This guy.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Really? They were..
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Right, right...
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
No! And that girl has a name.
He says --
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
Oh God. What hospital?
St. Joseph's.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
So you had sex with him?
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
But Al is your husband now!
What is she, at work?
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Welcome to work, Ed.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Okay ...
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Well, when you put it that way.
Can't we just --
That's lucky.
Shari, I really like you...
So...?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Ed?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Come on, let's go.
Somewhere.
Come on...
Are you all right?
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
The what?
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
It's nice.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
You're in show business?
I'm making a tape.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
What?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
I'm doing all right.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
Yeah?!
That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Great.
You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
Look, we gotta talk.
Cassie...
Ray, come an--
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
You know what your problem is?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
Hi.
Hm?
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Ed?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
By the X.
El/ella -
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Yeah, just --
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
So nice
Yeah?
I think we've got a problem.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Ethics are...
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Hey, that's super
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Good luck, Tracy.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Sporty.
Uh-huh.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Would you sign it for me?
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Hmm?
Which door?
I have proof.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
More this way.
Should we get a what?
Yep.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Sherry... I love you.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
And she's super-nice
Okay, let's say
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
And 290 "disregards," right?
Larry, you just take it easy
What?
So?
These are private -- these are for us.
I mean at you.
For what?
What do you mean?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Paul, get out!
What'd I do?
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Tell me about Patchett.
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
It's Bud.
So you saved her.
We talked.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
Dudley, what do you want?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
How?
You've got it, Wendell.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Five minutes.  That's all.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Lynn.
She told you?
Dudley's guys.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Let's just kill them.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
That's right.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
Susan Lefferts.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
Clean?
More or less.
I don't have time.  I have --
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Believed what?
Say what?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
And what?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Dudley, we've been over this.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
His blood's always up.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Something like that.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Give me a minute, will ya?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
You make a mistake?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Of his penis, sir?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
Why not?
You, me and White, huh?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
On what evidence?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
A sweet man.
Under the house.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
I like it!  I like it!
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
I just called it.
A bootleg...
Something like that.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
And no one'll know about this?
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Working whores with squad two.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Who are you calling?!
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Do it!
When can you get it here?
A direct one.
Told by whom?
Yes.
Yeah.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
Wait. What do I do?
They're spooks.
I don't know what that--
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
What if--
And you won't. Now move--
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
Look, my wife is understandably--
What'd I tell you?
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
I was a traffic analyst.
Why'd you leave?
They come after you?
Who?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
You're driving.
Drive.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Goddammit--
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Who?
How fast can you learn?
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
C'mon.
Not particularly, no.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Well then who can?
What are you saying?
You got any money?
That's fine.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Can you help me?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
About the accident.
I can't.
Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
Not a very good one, but--
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
No.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Leave this house.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Stacy--
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
I was missing you.
What is it?
You did good.
Don't count on it.
Why the hell would I--
It tastes like fish.
It is fish.
Not that much.
When do I get to meet him?
It's how he works.
Yes.
Other than Brill.
You're not.
All right, look--
You got a minute?
Who's doing this?
Bullshit.
Tell me about Brill.
I've never met him?
This conversation's over.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Why would the Union--
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Where's Stacy?
Really?
You staying for dinner?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Did they take your clothes?
Serve the ball.
Into what?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Why would they--
Why would the NSA--
To the cops?
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
No. No, it's okay.
Turn yourself in.
What does that have to do with you?
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
Fuck you.
I said fuck you.
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
He had help.
He's clever. He had help.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
Yes sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
And if it wasn't?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
How'd you get in the building?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
Puffed cheese?
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
Hello!  Good morning.
Which stall?
I don't want to go back.
Excuse me.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Ask Al Auf. Almsy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Shall we be all right?
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
No.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Don't.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.
I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Shall we be all right?
Don't do this.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't talk.
Don't leave me!
I know.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
Still a car.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Very well.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
In my room.
What's the matter with you?
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
I told you so.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Don't cut me.
I don't know what that means.
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
For?
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
Yes.  Dropping off.
Are you remembering more?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Because I'm a nurse.
He needn't disturb you.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
I've been told that before.
Kip's another one.
Hey! -
Would you like me to?
Hana, I know you do!
I love you.

I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
I don't think so.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
I try not to expect you.
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
Nya-nya-nya!
I mean home.  India.
Then come with me.
And what if he really is a spy?
Hello miss.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
A toddler
Pardon me?
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
Bingo.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Don't overestimate yourself.
He's on to something bigger.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
No you can't.
I can't?
Then don't.
Uh, yes.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Maybe I should drive this time.
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
I never carry...baggage.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Let's just see how we do.
We are...for the tools.
A dozen times.
It's---beautiful.
Thank you.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
You can't be too careful.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Where the money is.
You've thought of everything.
We're doing it tonight.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
There's always a surprise.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Feeling old?
Can't be too careful.
Call it a new tradition.
Four billion dollars.
They drive so recklessly there.
I sincerely hope not.
Go!
I'm not leaving without you.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
What about you?
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
In the van.
And you do it so well.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
This better be worth 1t.
It's too soon.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
You change partners, you change the rules.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
I figured that out.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
It's those files you asked for.
What's your point?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
Yes?
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
They did?
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
Five million dollars?
Five million dollars.
And get someone to help around the house.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Bullshit, you don't.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
What medical records?
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
So you think we got 'em scared?
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Erin --
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Show me the document that proves that.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
So what are you thinking?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
And, what, I'm not serious?
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
And if you had to guess ...
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Erin --
No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
Take it.
Did he say why?
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
You're married.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
How come you're not eating?
I don't know.
In the conference --
I'm gonna go live with George.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Ten?
You got a little girl?
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Right.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Better safe than sorry.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
I'm gonna clean it up.
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
No, I wanna say hi.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
What's that?
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
I need it.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
That's okay.  I understand.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Yeah.  Who are you?
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
You're moving away?  When?
Next week.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
I feel The Force.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Barks his agreement.
Barks his right on!
Yeah ...
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
I have felt it.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
It can wait.
I'm going to see what it is.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Yes.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
What is it?
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
I do not!
Try and control this ...
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Can you trust him?
You look great.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.
This ought to be good.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
You may call me Leia.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
What?
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
I'll be back later.
I thought you knew this person.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
You are reckless!
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
But I feel The Force flowing!
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
What's in there?
If it must be.  Yes.
Time will tell.
Never.
It won't get through the blockade.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Good God.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Not anymore.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Somebody get off!
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
What's the little black box do?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
I'm here.
Does he know how to activate it?
Delgado?
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
No way.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Later.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Looking to get out.
Which way?
Down that way.
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
Are you crazy?
No screamin' shit.
The freeway.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Find Cuervo Jones.
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
Move aside!
I gave up my castles and my lands!
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
In the great book.
What?!
What's this, what's this?!
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Guenevere...
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
...to ride out and meet them.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
So be it.
Well hurry then, and get it.
You freed it, son?
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
Without Lancelot?!
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
I'm not jealous!
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
A lovestruck page!
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
That I cannot.
People make you laugh?
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
I?
To kill and be king, is that all?
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well what's wrong?
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
It's-
I'm sorry.
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
What didn't he tell you?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
It's serious?
May I ask...?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
Yes, I go now.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
What man?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Yes, I think so.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
You're kidding! Like what?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Where?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Why, I don't understand?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Like what?
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
No.
Your kidding?
I found it.
Where?
Yeah.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Captain who?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
I wouldn't talk.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Well I heard differently.
Honey it's to help you.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
St. Mike's.
How's the girl?
She seemed fine.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Withering Heights.
Who's in it?
No.
You might loosen the straps then.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
You and us.
La plume de ma tante.
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
O'Lord hear my preyer.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
Can you give her something?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Only what I read in the papers.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Are you tired?
Be silent!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
It's our goddamn car!
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
So?
Suit yourself.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
What's our friend's problem?
They're falling out.
How many?
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
How will he eat?
My brother and I. One each.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Out.
Fuck him.
You're their uncle.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Bosen black.  Flat.
Why the interest?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
We gotta go, Jack.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
What do you mean?
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
It wasn't like that.
That how you see it?
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
Get out of here.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Yeah.
We're gonna be here a week?
Yeah.  You mind?
Why would I mind?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Because I can hear it.
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Time flies, huh?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
What the hell are these?
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
What are you talking about?
He was wearing a suit.
How come I didn't hear anything?
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
Celebrating.  Join me?
The party's over.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
February?
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Better give her pneumonia.
No.
I don't know. Some disease.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Fuck you.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Yeah, fine.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
She asked for it.
The audience was a little off tonight.
No, we're not.  Jack?
All right.
Doctor's orders.
Well, that's fine --
Right.
Yes, it is.
Impersonally.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
So run a little longer.
That's the premise.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Changed?
Where's your dress?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Virgins.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Smells like tuna number two to me.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Tell her.
Huh?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Uh ...
What?
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Is that important?
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Gotta go.
Funny job.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
His kid's sick.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Forget it.
Nothing personal --
It's okay.  Last one.
In and out.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Better than that.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
How do you know?
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
Who's Nina?
Sure.
Soap?
He called her.
Long story.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
There's always another girl.
We outgrew each other.
So how's the cat food business?
Huh?
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Married.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Wow.
Why not?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Yeah?
Oh, fine.
Eddie.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
I'm not the same person you remember.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
How old is he?
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
Shut up.
Let me have a look.
A few blanks?  Like what?
Like ...
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
For being one helluva guy.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Is that what you think?
How come?
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
Don't hang up ...
What more proof do you need?
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Jon, what is it?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
That's what they always say.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
What are you going to do, Castor?
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Shoot him!
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
I'm going to have you fired.
Like you know anything about it.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
That's your name, isn't it?
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
Just following your example.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
What do you know about it?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
You always say that -- then you leave.
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her?  Just like that?
I don't know.  Maybe...
Why Jack?
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people...
Im sure you do...
Wheres my real dad?
Bye...
Big Eds.
Thats where you work.
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Ringing my bell...
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
I dont think so.
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Howd you know my name?
I never won anything in bowling.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Ive got all the time in the world...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
I've got everything I need.
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
Give me my goddamn life back!
How much time?!
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
Cmon, as soon as I put them down, youre gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Thank you.
No, I didnt...thats great.
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Okay, chief.
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Jack...dont even start...
But its twenty degrees outside...
...my feet are hurtin...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
You had a heart attack?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
How would you look at it?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
But you always seem so certain.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Annie goes to a great school.
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
Are you okay, Jack?
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Its good to see you...
Paris?
Not with what they pay me...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Okay, Ill take them...
You wont regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/As...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Im sorry, no...
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
I mean...
Relax, it's casual.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
I had it at four.
<u>Should</u>?
Solid.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Ben.  Are you okay?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
We're working as hard as we can --
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Baby, you're scaring me.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Victor did.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
Oh, he did.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
You've been working out.
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Sweet.
Dude.  That's my sister.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Front page?
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Not at all.
Ben's still out there --
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
I was talking about us.  Working together.
What?  What do you mean you --
Are you kidding?
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
I gave him twenty.
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Susan.  What are you doing?
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Phase Two.
No...
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
Message to Proteus.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
What're you getting at?
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
How bad off is he?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
But big enough for us...
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I have no idea.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
No, it requires such absolute precision --
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Nothing -- against all that force.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
You left something out.
The Breath of God...
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Oxygenation...
How are you, Miss Peterson?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
You have no right to blame Duval --
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
I can't tell you.
Go ahead.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
I don't think so. It's nice.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
No.
Jezhush.
We split that.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Okay.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
...The heck d'ya mean?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah, he -
Oh, don't be silly.
Officer Olson.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Ya got that right.
No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
Chaska.
Oh, yah?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
A subconscious-type thing.
Uhn.
Oh, man!
Yah, right -
Yah.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Ya kiddin'!
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Yah, how much money was that?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Where're you going?
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
Stan Grossman called.
...Is everything okay?
Yah.
OOOoooh!  His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
We're good to loan in.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Well, they -
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
...There's a million dollars here!
No, see -
Mm.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah...
Uh-huh.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Oh, yah?
Gotta go?
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Well, how the heck are ya?
Oh, pretty good.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
I always liked ya so much...
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Yah, is this Marge?
Norm?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Linda Cooksey?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Gustafson's accountant.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Copy.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Uh-huh.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Oh, fine.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
It's terrific!
Yah.
That's terrific.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
He's at -
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Really, what's that?
You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  They say he only sleeps one hour a night.  You know about this guy?  Tyler Durden?
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
Does this sound strange to you?
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
I'll ask the questions, son.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
You're kidding.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
This could go on for hours.
Goodbye.
She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral in her book.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
I could check your prostate.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Is that what you're calling it?
What did you say... ?
Say my name.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
What?
You are an insane person.
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
What do you want me to do?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Being clever.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
A hotel?
Huh?
Would that be a problem?
Yes, you can.
What?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Surprise me.
Strange.
Call what off?
This fight, pussy.
My dad.  No question.
Same here.
Hum.
Doesn't matter.
You?
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Okay.
It isn't... ?
I thought you did.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
Tell him!
Hey.
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
I'm not asking you to.
Nothing.
... is over.
"Applicant?"
"Training?"  Tyler...
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
What... ?
And, sometimes you control it...
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
I can't let you...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...stop me?
I'm not going...
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
What?
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
What?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Well, sir, you said you might.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
There is no money.
Really?
Yes, it is.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Pleeeeeease!
How'd you know?
Yesssss...
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Why?
I... I don't know...
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
Signs?
I...I...
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Who?
What?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Take my van!
No.  What's this about?
Take a guess.
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
Hold on.
Who is this guy, anyway?
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
I know how it feels to be dead.
I can live with thaaaa --
Sure.
I...I don't know.
I guess so.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
That it's not over yet.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
He's not a witch.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Like... 4:25.
Nothing is... anymore.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
I don't.
Look, there's something you should all know.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
That's a plan.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
No one's that strong.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
What just happened?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Star Wars?
Show me how it operates.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Batteries not included.
There are no worse places.
Damn!  Leeches.
I had it cupped.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Alright.  Home run.
You never been in one of those things.
How much we got left in that minigun?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Invulnerable.
Let's get that tent down!
That's an order.
Sorry, Sir.
Why me?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
What?
He... took it.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
Black.  No sugar.
I know.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
Mind if I sit down?
I say we tape him to a chair.
Yeah.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Well, there's nobody special!
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
Okay.  ... I love you...
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
What does that mean?
My agent.  I called my agent.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
How have you been?
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
Tragedy?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
Come on now...You can't sit here.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Fine.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Which ones?
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Where -- ?
I'm the one what?
A quest?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Funny -- you look married.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
What are you doing?  Give that back!
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Who?
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
OWW...MAN...
Oh...like Moses.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
You don't have to say that.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You said.
Out where?
I'm not.
I hope they do.
You treat me like I was.
Now, hand...
Is what you?
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Okay...
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
No.
Who?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
I didn't get it, did I?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Am I on TV?
No.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
He's had two strokes.
Tita, I've got to go...
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Like what?
What?
With applesauce?
My turn.
I don't know where she is!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
But what about me?
And you no longer play at all?
Swimming?
Why?
If you're free.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Thank you.
I was really very moved by the way you...
None.
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
I don't believe vou.
Yeah, I think I could.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Will you let me talk to you, please?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
No, it's okay.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I hope I didn't hear that.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Hold onto this.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
There's some good things on it, though.
Yes.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Fine.
Look at me.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Hi.
Nothin'.
So what's her name?
A play-ya.
That's it?
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I did.
I kissed those girls.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
She lives near Eddie?
I think by Twenty-two.
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
You said before, that he got boxes?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Okay, then dance. Show.
You here to see somebody?
Yeah.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Probably.  One of the many.
So, then whadda ya want?
Wha'?
You gotta girLfrLend?
You mean her.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
Full name.
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
What'll it be Fletch?
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Margaret.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
No idea at all?
For sure?
My pleasure.
What, the heat here?
Thought so. What for?
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
What?
You find the source?
Nothing. They're still there.
Oh my God!
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I guess not.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
I agree.
Till then.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
What?
Wait a second --
Cut the crap and read it.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Whoops.
Harry S. Truman?
Right.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Velma.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Course he has. That's his wife.
I know.
Sure you did.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Why not?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
You sure got the hard part.
Sure.
'Magic' today, huh?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
How long have they been married?
How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John! You used to fly together!
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
So were my parents.
Please.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
I bet you do.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Here, take mine.
You were in the war?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Good point.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
Yeah.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
What are you talking about?
Act natural.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I think you better sit down.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Don't tell me I can't --
They're trying to kill me!
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
In her cabana, sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
I would, actually.
Who are you?
This morning.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Irwin...
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
Why not? Oh shit... really?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
What...
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Not really.
I was upset.
My secretary.
In a minute!
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I don't know, I never met your father.
Excuse me?
Uh, let's go sit down.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Exactly.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Make eye contact when you say that.
Contacts.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Hey, they blew me.
Why are all these people after me?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
There's that question...
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Yeah, go on...
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Two words.  Disco Express.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
Fine!
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Let me go out like a man.
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Go on, another time, another place.
Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
That's cute.  You're funny.
Hey, the poet...
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
Mr. Doyle.
What?
B.O.C.A.
Who brings it?
Where do you want it?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Sal --
Don't forget anchovies. 
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did they follow you?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Si tu veux.
That's a relief.
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?

Willie Mays.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Who's on him?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Policy man in Queens.
The greaser with the blonde.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Suspicion of what?
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
I can't.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Whatta you got?
Pass.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
So what?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
I'll go find Hayes.
Did he?
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
I'm serious.
So am I.
The future guy?
Hello, Frank.
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Do you know where I found this?
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
Uh, huh.
Frank, this is insane...
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
I'm right here behind you...
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Queens, New York.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Hello?
What'd you say your name was?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
W...B...2...YXB.
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
Sun spot?
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Nah, I gave it up.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
When?
Chief?!  Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
I'm glad.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
John, he's got my driver's license.
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Huh?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Nothing you're willing to do.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Which means he probably knew her.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  What house you work?
Nah, just working the job.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Sullivan?
Fuck you, asshole.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Where are you going?
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Where's Shelly?
If you insist.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Don't do that to me!
Be a man, man.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
You go ahead...
Nothing.
Are you all right, Shelly?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Not us!  He's really creepy.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Maybe.
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
You're the boss.
I just want you to like me.
I never said you were "nothing".
Who's Horace?
Alright, alright.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Yeah, that's fat too.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
Okay.  There's one.
It's just beginning.
Come and get it.
Wait a minute. I just...
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
But what I get scared again?
Yeah, we're here.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
Please don't do anything crazy.
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
You need to leave.
So's he and he knows it.
Get up!
That's very colorful, chief.
Sorry.
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Oh my God, Steven.
Okay.
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
About what?
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
He bought you that?
I guess not.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
And you'll never do it again.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
They're out of town.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm staying.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
But Sean said...
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
I...I can't...
You can and you will!!
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
We changed our minds.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Crosstown.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
Shut up, Elliot.
Quietly effective.
Press a button and they give us money.
It's over, finished and done with.
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
What happened eighteen months ago?
I think we Nought to wait.
I'm not ready.
Here we go.
What?
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
I hear Alan's sick.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
What about her?
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
This is how we've managed to last.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Is it?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
Who the hell cares?
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
She's my gynecologist.
It violates so many trusts.
Washed away.
You're hurting my head.
This could be it!
I'm at the door.
Right here. At the door.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Let's not start that again.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
Show him who we are.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
You're charming the boy.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
Because faith is rewarded.
This could be it!
hat was this morning.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
Sidney.
I was educated by nuns.
Yes.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
There was a review.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
And he has finer moments now and then.
What?
You know what.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Is it true?
He wears a disguise.
But you're his friend.
Never mind.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I'm going home to my machine.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
Well, we shall try.
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
I've never spoken for anything else.
You will respect the law.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
I hope not.
Even as a boy I thought so.
Hm.  Is it?
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
I would rather march.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
No.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
The fools!  Sorry...
I dined at the prison.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
He's "discovering" India.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
It's over.
God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I'll see what I can do.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
What a pity.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
We don't have the manpower.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Jerome--?
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
What's wrong with him?
You have more in common than you know.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
You had to be a right-hander.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
You wish.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
A day or so.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
We can't stay here.
They found my eyelash.
Where?
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
Again?
You may as well invite her here.
Not bad, Jerome.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
I'm travelling too.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
I hope he's not just a body.
That's the hair color in his profile?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
How tall are you?
You worried about the cost?
Yes.
I know about you.
Does it have a name?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
You're angry--
You'll be next.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
What exactly is wrong?
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
My medication.  I left it back there.
Only every time I'm in here.
New policy.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Stay clean.
That's your problem.
No applause!
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
I bet.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Where do you want to go?
Where did you get them developed?
After four years and now the question comes up.
It's just been a while.
Really.
You were asleep.
Suit yourself.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
That bad?
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I mean it.
He might be ready to chop us up.
Do it my way.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Do it my way.
You sent me to him.
She's on TV.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Sure?
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
No scars.
We got this far.
You want to try with me?
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
I'll be ready.
Where do we go from here?
No, I'm afraid not.
Oh my God.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Yeah. I got out.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Suit yourself.
What about the vault?
Whatever you need.
Aren't we going a little hard?
What do you have in mind?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Just sandwiches...
Why not?
I kinda doubt it.
Come on. How much?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You got it.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
I Just want to find a suitcase.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
How'd it happen, then?
I know.
Never mind.
What name?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Why?
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
What about?
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
It's the truth.
Yes, I do.
Who?
Oh, do you?
Yes.
Go on.
Really?
He was here for four days.
Could you do me a favour?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Of course. Where else?
Nasty.
And what was that?
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
What girl?
Shouldn't think so.
Then he must have pulled her.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Thanks for coming.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Yeah.
At me friend's house.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
Nobody seems to know.
Right.
Large Scotch.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's what he was saying about you.
Nowt.
Four of them.
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Get knotted.
You don't look it.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What you going to do?
No.
No. Are you tired?
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Funny, that.
It would be. If they were still living.
Meaning what?
Still got a sense of humour?
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
Sod off.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yep.
Shut up.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
Ha.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
Mmm...
They killed the goose.
It's not right.
No.
That's right?
No.  That's absolutely right.
...that's right...
Nurses.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
No.
You build it!
They have...
What?
What do you mean?
That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
You haven't talked to him.
As an idea.
What did you say?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
You're actually talking about this?
Did you talk to Graff?
What did he say?
A buck a shot.
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
I...
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
Why would they come to me?
Why would I do it?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Why?
Do you need five grand?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
How ya doing?
What?  You can't do any what?
Yes.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said he filed...
Down the street.
Were the leads insured?
Yeah.
A waste of time?  Why?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Why don't you think so?
No.
No, who?
Thieves.
That they're going to be upset.
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Excuse me, sir...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Who are you?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Would you excuse us, please.
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Anyone in this office lives on their wits...  I'm going to be with you in a second.  What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you? 
You're done, come down, and let's...
...I, if you'd listen to me. Please.  I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...do you want to go downtown...?
Under him?
Not lately it isn't.
Murray...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
You know what those leads cost?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
Not lately you can't...
And fifty bucks a lead.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
I can't do it, Shelly...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
What are you trying to tell me?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Uh-huh?
Mmm.
John: John:...my daughter...
Fuck you.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Shit.
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
They took the phones...
Guess who?
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: "Now is the time."  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together. 
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
No, his wife is.
Twelve-fifteen.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Kenilworth...?
Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. 
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
I don't understand.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
Tell me again.  Your wife.
What does that mean?
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
They took 'em...
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
They didn't get my contracts.
It went down.  I filed it.
Yes.
I...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Three.
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
Your contract went out to the bank.
Yes.
No, where is it?
That's right.
What position did you occupy?
Oh yes, the very best.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Michael...
No.
Tom is right.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you...
He is weak.
 You're a good fellow.
Let's go.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
We're making an investment in Havana.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
 And he agreed?
Chi?
Within the compound will be fine.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Sure, Mikey.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
And Kay...she's all right?
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I want it met.
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Mike wants it.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
Do you owe markers?
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
I'm going to the market.
Whose orders are these?
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Yes, Michael.
Does it feel like a boy?
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Why don't you sit down?
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
Where can we talk?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Not for a few years.
Yes.
We do favors for each other...
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
They feel cheated.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Good.
Sitting right behind you.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
The same assurance we got from you.
Yes.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
What was that?
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Weird.
If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
You liked it too.
Sure.  I loved it.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
What're you talking about?
Tea is fine.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
Your wife?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
Yes!  You know?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Mornin'.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
Yes.  You were a Marine.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
You don't say?  Which picture?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
Go ahead.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
I don't like to talk about that.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
No.  I --
Do you miss it?
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
You first.
Oh no.  I never swim.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
I didn't --
You're the one who started it.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Run for what?
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Never gave it much thought.
Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
The Great War?
A very lucky thing indeed.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
What happened?
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Your friend?
You are much too human.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Did I hurt you?
Fuck off!
You told me to get you up, asshole.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
That's what I'm trying to explain.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
So what do I do?
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Of course.
Oh dear.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
A visitor.
No.  I expect you can't.
Sure.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
You're serious.
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Righto.  Let me see.
You didn't?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Fish.
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
I don't want him hurt...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
One more night --
Right there -
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
How is he?
What for?
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
Let them go --
Get out of here, then. Now.
Kip.
Not my girl anymore
What do you want from me?
Right ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
Good.
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Peugot convertible ...
Gray.
We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
There's no one left ...
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
What does that mean -- ?
We don't -- ?
Remember who my brother is?
You, too, Ma...
oh.
He's in some trouble ...
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Don't go there, Toby --
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Something like that -
Okay --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
What?
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
I can handle it --
Me.
Otto called -
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
Nah.
Come here -
I know. I've missed you, too
Toby...
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
We can't do that, dude --
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
Where we going -- ?
For real?
What are you doing here?
Buy you a drink?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Kip's in trouble
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Six or seven...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
No ... ?
Oh, yeah.
Deodorant.
I take out my slim-jim...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Wrong preposition...
No worries ...
I dunno. I know a place.
What's that?
The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
Who's "Eleanor?"
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
You sure I can't go with ya?
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Not --
Checkin' it out
Shit all looks the same here --
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Anybody!  You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
The bag with the envelopes.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
What are you talking about?
Jezuz Christ!
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
With what?
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
What are you talking about?
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
There are cops all over the place.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
You're some fucking jerk.
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
I hate to do dishes.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
I got dry cleaning.
What? Come on!
I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
All right, then.
Stop crowdin the plate!
I don't know yet.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
No one. I didn't have the number.
Why not?
She went to Medical school in California.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
Okay.
Yeah, it is.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Shut the fuck up.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
You want us to give you cash right now?
How'd you like that course?
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
Codebreaking.
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
And what do you see?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No students work for me.
Which one's your building?
Really?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
--Half-red, half-black--
I told you to cooperate with these people.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I appreciate that.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Find out what?
You've heard of Albert Einstein?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
I got your card.
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Why me?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Not at all.
Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
What don't I understand?
--And confuse him--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Where're you going?
Let's hit "Kelly's."
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
I go places, I interact.
Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Probably not.
That must have taken you a long time.
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
285.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Why thank you.
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Haven't called her.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
My wife's dead.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
That's right.
I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
You're kiddin' me.
I guess.
What did you think?
Do you have a soul-mate?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
The wrench, why?
I know, I know...
Yeah, I think so.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
I kind of got that impression.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Sure.
No.
No I haven't...
How was that?
Pretty boring, I guess.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
What, five?
Not a chance.
Do you keep in touch with them?
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
If you bring the caramels.
I've never seen your place.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
No.
It's important that I learn this.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
I guess so.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
What?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What am I scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Yes, I do, Will.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Fan-belt's shot.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Short fella. Pale face.
I didn't see nothin'.
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
Sure, but what is this?
Two.
Can all of you work?
Why, I guess so.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Deputy sheriffs.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
That's the way it is.
Say, who runs this place?
Government.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
No, I never. What?
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
You're right!
I aim to.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Lissen, I heard that before--
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
I stay in my own yard.
You been acrost?
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
I'm ready.
Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
Look, Ma!
Was Granma bad?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Good-by, Tommy.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
There, them stripy ones.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They gone.
But who done it?
Are you crazy?
I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Whatsa matter?
Won't they ketch us?
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
Morning.
Can you pick peaches?
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
In the corporate offices.
You do not.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Okay. See you later.
What do you want to do?
Then express yourself, Bob.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Overflowing with love.
I'm a professional killer.
Yep.
Watched television?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
That'd be good.
Yes.
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Like heroin?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Yes.
No.
It's something I do...
I was leaving.
What if I come back?
You don't understand...
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
Come on.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
What stuff?
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a union?
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
No harm no foul.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Not bad. You?
Hey, Bob.
Lisbon?
--Nooo--
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
I love. I kill.
Patch him through....
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
I'll pay.
I'm not happy.
They blame you for the compromise.
In Detroit. This weekend.
There's nothing to be done about it.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Yeah. I guess we did.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Fair enough.
You too.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.
No.
He sold me this bad boy.
See you in ten years.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
That's good.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
It is cocktail hour yet?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
A jogger, huh?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Oh yes. I forgot.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Five years. My son was born here.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
How did you meet her?
Tom.
I don't care! We'd be together.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
What about him?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Mom?
Maybe they should put me down too.
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
Whatever you want.
Fine!
I don't care.
What?
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Little.
I didn't see it.
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
I said... I started.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
That's not true.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Good.
Hi.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
How's my pregnant chick!
Aw... that's so sweet.
Do you? Do you really?
What did he say?
I'm not pretending anything!
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
About what?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
No. I am a "tubab."
Where to?
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I was there for that shot, actually.
What was it like?
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
You too, Diane.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
It isn't right to make him suffer...
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
We should be fine, then.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
It's never too soon to start.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
Sure.
What does that mean?
So?
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
I'm okay... I'm okay.
I know. Amazing.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
The number's by the phone.
How long were you married?
Honey... I was always good.
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Cool?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Waste the dude.
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Was that her top?
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Yo, hit the lights.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
And what's he do?
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Yeah, mom?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Nah. I don't play well with others.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
What's this one eat?
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Yeah! Sure.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. RISC is good.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
You what?
I'll make it up to you!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Yeah.
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
What's happening?
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
My name is the Plague.
Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
The rabbit is in the administration system.
What? whatwhatwhat?
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
What, it left a note?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Pervert! What are you talking about?
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Nonono, thank YOU!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
I'm not angry it's just
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
I don't know Brady.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Michael Myers.
Look.
We're trapped in this house.
Brady!
Go!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
It's okay..it's okay.
Why not?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
How many bodies did you find?
Outside.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
It's been eleven months.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
You knew. You just didn't care.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Its not over yet.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Its true, Sheriff.
He's been here.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Huh?
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
The guys think I'm too smart.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Lies.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He was watching me.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
I don't know.
Come with me.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Is that all you say?
Go get me a beer.
Are you sure?
Michael's around someplace...
Yeah.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
You all right?
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
Where?
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Can we watch the monster movies?
Sure. Sure.
I don't like that story.
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
What about the bogyman?
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
I promise.
No! Do as I say.
Will you get her for me?
Of course not.
I've given them his profile.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
Thorazin.
Are there any special instructions?
I see.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Move it!
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Mmm?
Well, let's hope so.
Well, let's do it.
Look at this.
Right.
It feels like you're in France.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Uh...
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
You're joking.
But I'm seeing him.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
And maybe my lawyer.
Oh no.  Not at all.
It's terrific!
Yes.
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Yes, but you name names.
I don't know exactly.
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yeah, sure. 
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Yes?
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got like six gold records.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
What are you doing?!
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Oh, don't say those words!
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
But not over me?
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Lee...
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
That's where your talent lies.
Mmm.
Was I?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
I don't know.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
No!
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Get his wine away.
This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
Always.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Because he likes you.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Why?
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Hello?
But not you.
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
I bumped into your...
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
No.
I'm okay.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Go right over there.
Wow!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
...from Mavis, also.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Will you just tell me one thing?
He's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Yeah.
Look, everything's going your way.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Oh, what do they know?
Yeah, that's clerical.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
My--uh...
I remember you.
Yes, you do recall, right?
Yeah, it was.
...namely a personality.
I'm okay.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Hmm.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Yeah.
...which I did not get.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
I <u>swear</u> to you...
I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
I have not read you your rights.
I hereby acknowledge that...
Or, perhaps...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
I'm looking for...
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
...they did it for a lark.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
That's what <u>you</u> think...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
...these guy'll back you up.
...his family has offered a large reward.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Yeah, so where is he?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Not with any certainty we...
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Show me the Pigs.
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Exactly.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, no, of course not.
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
...young boys, still...?
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
I can make you rich.
Why?
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
What is that supposed to mean...?
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
How's your <u>child</u>?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Waal...
A wonderful country...
...should love to correct your error. 
...how so?
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
Why did you look at me that way?
I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but <u>clean</u>.  Just dressed--in the middle of the...
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I have had the honor. 
Enchante.
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Where do you live?
Yes.... yes...
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...but will that satisfy you?
<u>Yes</u>.
...which of us is free...?
The girl needs help.
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>! 
...not to turn around.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
Why?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
....because we don't have any mmm...
...what did you want? 
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
And why should we believe you?
What shape is the scar?
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
Dottore Fanelli...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
Yes.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
You have no idea. Now run away.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
I hope so...

You're all making me blush...
Your Secret admirer?
That wants to be a Yes.
Nothing.
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Yeah. And?
Yes, it does.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Yes you do.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling.

Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
You did last night.
Because you're an idiot.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Something like that. Will you do it?
I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
No. Hell no.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
Oh shit, yeah.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Jealous much?
Give me the clipboard.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
You're not funny.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
You must have had fun.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Of course.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
You didn't say Simon Says.
You know what I want, babe?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
Superb.
What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
Come on through.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
I'm educating myself!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
Love, you can still write to each other.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Mummy!
That idiot boarder?
Just a couple more . . .
I need my sodding parents' consent.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Your wife...?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Pitbull attacks.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Really? Do tell.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
How much time off?
Yeah? You and who else?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Ambrose. I know.
I've been in here before.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
Where's Allison?
What's that?
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Eighty four.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
It's perfect.
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Thanks.
We're all here for you Trevor.
Music to my ears.
Two.
Can you follow them?
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
I surrender...
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
Bill, listen...
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
Bill, I got financial problems and...
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Underbelly!
Lie, you mean...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Yes.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
You do?
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
LaPlante!
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
She's talking to him now.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Never reach out!
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
I didn't ask him.
Okay.
Whoa, check it out.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
And the rent is okay?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
No, no, no, no.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
-- a sense of proportion.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
What happened?
Uh huh.
About us.
A man scared me.
Uh huh.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I could take a cab on the way home.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
What?
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
What?
He made, you know, a remark.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
All new houses have noises.
How long does it have to be a new house?
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Fuck you, Philip.
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
He wasn't there.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
What did the thermometer say?
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
It's a double.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
Not now.  I'm busy.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
We don't have any proof of that.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
No.
No.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Most people are afraid of death.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Who are you?
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
Sing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
You?
I hear you.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
Leaving what?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Then it's worth the journey.
I'm sure they will.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
You always get to go first.
What do you think?
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
Your life.
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
What are you hoping to find inside?
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Why?  What's going on?
I'll be fine.
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
New York is dangerous place.
About what?
You look like you have.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
Why don't you tell me.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
You?
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
How could they get by him?
I don't know.
What's that next to him?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
That's what the Kurgan said.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
I know.
I can take care of myself.
And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
My dreams died long ago.
Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
I think he's dead!
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Keep trying.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
I understand.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
He knows better than that.
Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
What are you talking about?
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
How about the cop?
I'm here.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
I gotta piss real bad.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Give up.
My father.
I'm getting a doctor!
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
We're trapped in a house.
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
Fuckin' A.
I don't know.
You have his address?
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Canyon Country.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Where is it?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Shh, they'll hear you!
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
I don't drink beer.
How about dog shit?
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Another minute.  Please --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
Go, Chief.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Stand by.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
Maddox!  You got that?
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
What's my name?
Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
I think so.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
He has lots of disks.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
Yes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
What do you want?
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
I'll be back.
Where is your family?
How many in your family?
Six.
Yes we have.
What's happening?
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
I can't, I don't have the men.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
The high command? Our high command?
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
Well rewarded Those were his words.
You said you had no whiskey.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Bring back your policemen...
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Of course.
Very soon.
Give me the phone.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
Show me your ID
What cards?
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
I will give you my house.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
We must do something.
You could have asked for a favor.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Dawn. Then they go.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
Go out! Where?
A kiss.
Yes.
A car.
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
What sort of plan?
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Many times.
Thank you, sir.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Where?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Not at all!
Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
C'mon.
Three times, to be exact.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
The...Fourth of July.
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Up here --
Over here!
And we get this money when?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Why not?
There's always exceptions.
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
-- listen to the man --
Better living through electricity.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
-- was that??
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
All accidents until proven otherwise.
You know everything you do gets me hot.
I know.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
-- in the act.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Where is she?
Asking the wrong person again.
-- I pose you the same question --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
What?
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
I can't remember at the moment.
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
What?
Good way to get your head blown off.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
I never saw you --
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
I'll take my chances.
-- confirming everything we already know --
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Then who did??
It works.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Why not?
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Sara...?
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
We don't have proof of that.
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
No!
That poor little girl.
By killing them?
I didn't do anything, mommy.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Ok...
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
That's great, honey.
Daddy help!
Good night daddy.
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
Ok.
No.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Who?
What about keeping an open mind?
A friend?
What?
We're not going.
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Maura.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
Why?
So what should we do, father?
Thank you.
The amulet...
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Well what is it!
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
I know what I saw.
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Where?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
What on earth were you doing down here?
Uh-huh.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
JP?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
I miss you too.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Something like that.
I laughed, I cried.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Gum.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
That's what you theenk.
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
I was the Warden?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Trust Leonardo....
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Actually he never told us what it was.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
We're here to say, your government was right.
I guess that's a no.
But you're going to tell us anyway...
What job?
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
You certainly do.
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
If you think you're getting past me...
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
Snappy.
With a little jazz.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
It's hardly the same --
I'm plenty happy!
Adenoids?
I myself --
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
...Why don't I just type this up...
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
...I'm sorry.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Now, Aim --
Norville!
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
Watch it, Archer --
Forty-eight years...
What the heck they doin'?
This you're familia' with.
I --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Get up!
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
...It is?
Say, that was a swell idea!
Geez, I --
Yessir.
Sir?
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
I --
Hmmm.
Not even behind your back?
Get out of my sight.
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Well... I'm for it...
Yeah, tell me about it.
Ya get the special?
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
The mark notices.
He notices.
...Her mother needs an operation...
He don't look wise.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Wait. I want to listen.
That doesn't sound like him.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
And charming?
Good morning.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I told you.
I hated her.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
No thank you. We should be off.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Rough day. Good night.
Hmm. Good night.
I... I think I am...
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
You think I --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
If you're going to insult me --
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
I'll drive you --
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
All right.
Fine.
Yeah.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Right. Gotcha.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
What you been up to?
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
It was all junk!
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Thanks for the advice Dave.
A key party?
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
Who?
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
How'd you know?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
But not too ashamed.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
See ya.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Flame on, asshole.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
What do you mean?
Let's see!
Just be careful.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
The Idiot.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Out.
You like him? He worships you.
Huh?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Greetings, Charles.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Right.
Mikey was looking for you.
All my model planes.
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Communist Viet Cong.
You never tasted the stuff?
Okay.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I had him!
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Who's playing?
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
How much closer would you say you were?
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
Worth pursuing?
Byrd's dead.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Anything.  It's important.
What time was that?
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
First I need a copy of the key.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
He's just rattling your cage.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Will?
Don't do this, Hap...
Habit.
The other guy?
Ran like hell to go to him...
She didn't tell me.
You're not missing much.
Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
You don't know.
My arm!
What was it?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Thought you might find that.
Did you have sex with her?
But you wanted to.
There's nothing more to talk about.
If you want it to be...
No back-up.
Yes, and very beautiful.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Ah! You have questions?
You mean we are not children of Satan?
Perhaps...
I have not spoken to him...
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
Your lover.
She is.
But why?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, I swear I did not.
And yet you knew what I would o.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
Does it?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
He jests.
Claudia - don't -
Why not?
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
The swamp...
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
I can't. Go away from me.
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Yes.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Come, Claudia...
What danger?
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
So you felt it too!
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Why should I be?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Yes...
I want a woman.
The crucifix -
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
But how do you know?
I don't know any hell -
Paris? You came from Paris?
As did the one who made me.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
I don't pretend to know.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
I know. Let her alone.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
What are you saying?
I didn't want to kill her.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
Lestat, what do you mean?
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
CLAUDIA!!!
That's all past, Lestat.
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
He did it to make you stay with him!
And did you lose her? Did she go?
But it has. There is no more to tell.
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
My daughter...
Yes!
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What are you doing in my closet?
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
But, he said he'd try.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
I also promised Tyrell.
Okay, I won't.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Is he?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
It's okay.
This weekend?
Fine. Show me the body.
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
You don't seem fine.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Right. Now I remember.
Deep breaths --
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
It's in my room!
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I trusted you.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
I'll talk real slow.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Hello?
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
No. Yes?
Cool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Well 
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
My friend -- what can one say --
This was once a cemetery.
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
No.  She shall not be left here.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
They shall not hurt you
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
How do you know what my father thought - -
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine 
What if he is?
Really, this is idiotic!
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell 
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
She's not too well.
What is her illness?
You were at those battles as a spectator   I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me  those men out there  dead or dying  by my order -- because I willed it so.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
But that should make you like her.
We still don't know that it's the plague 
Well, tell, him.
Then foreclose!
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
I'm hurrying.
I hate to do this, fella.
What did . . .
Oh, no.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Zuzu's petals.
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Sit down? What are . . .
That's the kid.
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
The Building and what?
I know that girl!
Thanks.
All right.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Well, what happened to you?
It will?
Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Oh . . .
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
No, sir.
Ummmm . . .
Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
Oh . . .
How's that?
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Huh?
I know, but . . .
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
How do you do.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Have you notified the police?
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
Well, I don't.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Uh-huh.
Eighteen.
You may kiss my hand.
Have you made up your mind?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Well, then, sit down.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
That does it  come here.
Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
What the hell.  For you....
I want to go faster!
No.
Yeah.
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Want to swim home?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
What is it?  What's there?
It's still there!
Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
You got it.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Right.
You can't stop me.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Sailing?
Because.
Oh, c'mon.
I kind of had plans....
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Sean's still out there.
Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing.  You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up.  Here's a test I did....
Me neither.
Is that what it is?
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
We don't know that, do we?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do you?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Is there one in these waters?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Late.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
I did, I did.
Santos' place.
Nothing, huh?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Terrific.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
What'd I say?
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Two of them are still missing!
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Did he raise the Kids?
Yeah?  Then what?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Now I really want to see it.
You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Great!
Tina Wilcox.
Shut up.
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Next week.
Mmmmmm.
Anything?
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
I'm not sure I can.
I can go out if I want to.
Name it.
I love it.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
When are we going out?  You and me?
You always go with Andy.
How was dive class?
Eat Cheerios.
Take me.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Brody's riding his tower.
He thought he had a good reason.
So?  So?
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Go on, you're tired.
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
No.
You will.  I'll see to it.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Okay, bye.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Are you scared?
They just wanted to say hello.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Make up your mind.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
I know I can capture it.
Thank you.
Okay.
Sure.  Let's go.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
No,  I'm not going through there.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
What do you mean, we don't?
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
... Okay.
Who's going to do it?
Michael, you're not going down there.
But you --
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Make this quick!
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Still sleeping.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Thanks for helping.
That's because I am the shark.
And here I thought I was charming you.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
And big for his age.
'Preciate it.
Someone's looking for you.
Massachussettans aren't.
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Now what?
Calvin said it was all right.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears in Georgia???
The world's southern most reaches.
You have a man near it?
No way.
That's impossible.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
So was Dad.
Who's grown up?
Gee, it's good to see you!
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
Chicken....
We forgot to stop at the store.
We need milk....
We need beer....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Then don't come any closer.
Off....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
I can't help it....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
It's beginning....
We'll be there....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
We're going down.  All of us....
I'm on the phone....
You're silly....
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I'm just getting started....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Good.  So will I....
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
You're not a pain in the ass....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
Why'd you take the boat?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I always listen to my feelings....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
The plane's turning....
I borrow it without telling him....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
I'm sorry...I....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
My vision is perfect....
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
Yes I can....
You got a better idea...?
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Get her started....
Good news travels fast....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Still tagging conch?
She's a tough lady....
I wish there was something I could do....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
You too, Michael....
You tagging them...?
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Put me down, damnit....
Forget it....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Shove it....
I don't like the song.
I've got to get to her....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
I'll take care of it.
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
You heard. Look for the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
I think you're here all day.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
O.K.
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Maybe?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
What do you mean, Ross?
Because I dislike her too much ..
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
We're going.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
You want me to stop the car?
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
You ain't going in alone?
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
Have you got a print from the hand?
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
<u>You</u> put it in there.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
It was probably the wind.
No.
No.
Oh.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
You know? How do you know?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
You do?
I wanna be near you ...
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
I know about the bachelor party.
That's right.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
I have to finish my job --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
-- stop --
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
No no. I knew.
Hello?
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
I just got goosebumps.
Well, I'm happy for you.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
And I am...
Plus, you could use that commission.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I'm relieved you said that.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Let's not tell our sad stories.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Why do you love me?
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
We decided to stay with you.
I'll give it everything.
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
No, I air-dry.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
No.
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Why not --
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Gorgeous.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Not a chance.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
Pleasure.
You okay?
Dick.
Jerry --
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Let's go the zoo.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Right up ahead, buddy --
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Just drop it Paul!
Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
When did you have it last?
Think.
He could have died.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
You mean it?
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
Here!
What about Eric?
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
Baryonyx?
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
The last of my breed.
Which one do you prefer?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
I want to be an astronaut.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
This plane can not land!
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Back out! Move!
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
How do you mean?
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
No.  I feel something.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
What are you talking about?
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
-- my --
Not without a shot of the nest.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Which one?
Well, is he?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I'm fine... I'm fine...
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Piss.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
You're going too?
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What do you think they want?!
What are they?
Why did you come here?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
But why?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Think fast, Sarah.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
These formations.  They're dried --
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
Oh, no!
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
JUMP!
You're sure we have to?
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
The door security systems are shutting down.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
What now?
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
What one?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Could I have a tissue please?
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Look.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
- - a gizzard - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
Like hell it is!
I know, it's very exciting.
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Try to!
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
You want to talk about this?
No.
Relatively.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
For a further three years.
Let's get outta here!
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Who?
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Please!
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Thanks, Dad.
Ray, start the tour program.
Sure.
They don't bother me.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
I really think we should go back...
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Come on.
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
He's fucking nuts.
Doesnit sleep?
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Insomnolesence...
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
_It's a second REM pattern_.
So what do we do?
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
Think it'll do any good?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
What is it really?
Yes -- we do.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Then its authority is in doubt.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Yes.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
I usually take lunch by the River.
In a small way.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
Why would you suppose so?
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
Yes.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
Tonight?
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Why were you given notice?
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
You don't believe that.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I -- I found your jailer.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Ludwig?
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
Father ... Father!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
That's your monkey, Denham.
) They are now.
What?
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
Yeah.
What's that?
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Don't belong?
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
Why isn't he locked up?
Here please.
Like for you to look for the man.
Will you let me go then?
I said yes, I see.
Gee.
Honest?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
No.
You said you wanted these.
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
Try some other ways. 
Well --
Mm.
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
Arlyn Page.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
Don't worry.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
We did this before.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Yeah.
Bree --
Right back at the start, right?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Trask wants to talk with you.
Mm.
I am.
I believed her, Pete.
I better keep looking.
It's got to make sense some way.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
What's in it?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Two years ago? Sorry.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Town Police.
We grew up together. Kids.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
I looked it up.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Trask --
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
Detroit.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest...
Show...
Wow!  French toast, really?
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
What if she forgets?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
Uh huh...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
We use the green and yellow.
That's okay.
That's okay...
I hate it.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
No.
You're no bargain either, pal.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Uh huh?
Are you...gonna go...away?
You mean for good?
Oh...
See you in the morning light.
See you in the morning light...
Sure.  Lots of times.
It's my name too.
You like it?
Are you going to get remarried?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
What else wasn't there?
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Where will my toys be?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Yes, your honor.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Did you wish to?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection!
Yes...
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Yes.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
I don't recall.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Yes.
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
So do you.
Yes...How's Billy?
You've been living here, in the city?
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Ted, do you love him?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
She'll be back...
I don't know, Jim...
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Right.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
I'm going to take it.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I lost him?  I lost him?
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Any prospects?
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Uh, huh...
A moment.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
No cried?
I know.
It is alright, Father.
Where will you keep them?
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
Hmmm.
Are you, General?
I will not approve it.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Soon.
It is calm.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
Me. First break of day.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
I am him.
Is that big?
Will we ever be in war?
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
Where is that?
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
But you will always be here?
Is that a true story, or pretend?
You decide.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
I have smarter men.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
You cannot.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
The Chinese.
Where is Poland?
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
It is possible, Holiness.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Hmm.
Like my mother.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Oh, yes.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Keystone what?
And you like me.
A spring trap!
This could end up saving your life,--
No crocodile has ever--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
So profound and fat.
Get the gun.
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Thank you, Jack.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
As if.  Will you miss me?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Oh, bullshit.
Could we have intercourse?
They could try to tranq him on land.
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
'Night.
Good luck.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Just forget it.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Let's get away from the shore.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
No thanks.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
I'm not mushing it.
Calm down.
Alright, Jack!
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
Hector.
You wouldn't?
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
No.
Good thinking.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Where is he?!
I'll take it!
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
Well.  At wakes.
I can look at dead things.
Seconds.  Three, four.
What kind of backup do we have?
Was he swallowed?
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
I'm sorry.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
He said he knew Karate!
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
A tooth?
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
It has nothing to do with--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Shitbutt?
I really... I should get back.
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Thanks, Ardelia.
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
Why not?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Lecter said a lot of things.
He knew her...!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Starling -
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Good idea.
That wasn't me.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Murdered...? How?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
You seem pretty sure of that.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
I think so.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Ahhh... Why?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
By the book, he's a sadist.
Yes.
Mmm. And what else...?
Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Two months.
Did he try to?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
Yes...! They were screaming.
But you could. You did.
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Thank you, Clarice.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
You have my word. Paul?
No fair! You lured him with produce.
We leave in the morning?!
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
You knew them.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
How did you learn English?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Sorry to disappoint you...
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
What?
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
And by sea!
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
I am sorry, Duncan...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
We were headed...
...Fort William Henry.
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
Excuse me...
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
And if we're unlucky?
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
That's all, sir.
You forget yourself!
By your leave, sir.
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
Fire!!!
Sir!
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
He did.
Can you fix it?
That's an order!
Just get in yours!
Good...It's going good.
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Where's Jones?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
All right...
It bit me!
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
I know that.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
How's TransOcean doing?
Hook's on 24...
What was it?
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
It's had a meal.
No fuckin' lie...
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
I ought to smack your face!
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Well, it's still a good idea.
Seven hundred for the pair.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
I thought this was a pub.
Like antiques.
You get the guns?
They were . . .
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Where did he get a hundred grand?
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Nope.
Yes?
Jesus Christ!
Son, have a look in his locker.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
All right, furry muff.
Try that one.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
What can I do for you?
I got the money to pay for 'em.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Furry muff, let's go.
What they like then?
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
No.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Hit the fuckers.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
Right as rain.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
I will loan you the money.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I like your bar.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
I can't help you, Plank.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
And that does include the amp?
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
What about all the gear?
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
Er, fertilizer.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
So?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I am, sir.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Thank you, sir.
He'll live.
Sergeant?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm feeling okay--
You're testing me?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Skinny?
Charley Wade.
Yeah.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
I'm not picking it up.
You still going to all the home games?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
You look good--
Yeah, well--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Uncle Al--
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
I'm a colonel.
Both.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
You know who I am?
That guy who got shot--
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
Good.
Cool.
You own this place?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Something like that.
Lead mine.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
It's a .45.
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
What's it doing on a rifle range?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
You know who it was they dug up?
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
You get much of that in here?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
That's right.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Why would you want to do that?
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]
Quien es? [Who is it?]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
We was crossin' the river--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
I thought you were married!
This girl has a child?
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
'57, 1 believe--
Seems like we have another one every week.
That's a matter of interpretation--
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
No.
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
Charley Wade.
Do you?
Open late.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Sam--
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
You told me one time it was true love.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I've seen 'em.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
What about it?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
For a while.
Enough with the clothes--
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
How much you got left?
It was for personal consumption.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
So I've heard--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Got him here?
So she tells me three times a week.
He hates me.
No--
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Yeah?
How come it feels the same?
More, I hope.
Two years.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Like your story is over.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Couple months before I was born--
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Yeah--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Gotta be in person.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
Just doing my job.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
Yeah. It's quiet--
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
He's gonna find out.
How much?
They go together.
Nix.
I love weird.
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
Knew what?
Don't.
You'll do more.than that.
It's him... it's him.
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Be ready.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Harry.
Harry.
Sure.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I can be very persuasive.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
It's okay.
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
Yes.
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
... they believe you.
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
What makes you so sure?
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Fuck you.
Mr. D'Amour?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
I'm here to offer you a job.
What's the difference?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
What for?
A ticket home,
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
I like to know why things happen.
No.
You want more money, is that it?
No.
Yes.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
She has no real grip on reality.
Yes...
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
Well... nobody.
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
They'll never find out.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
It's me betrayed him.
Didn't know you read minds.
Is that all?
And you believed him?
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
No.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
He's better off this way.
In my time, and nobody else's.
Yes?
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
What is?
Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Yes.
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I'm thinking about it.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
I'm here for the week.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
OK, see you downstairs.
No, its easy.
Really?
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, I was looking at you.
Oh.
How old is she?
Oh, she'll love it.
Working.
No.
Yes.
Yes?
Do you like massage?
Take them.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
You know, eat healthier.
Do you want to- 
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Bye.
Hospital?
One moment.
Sure.
Are you sure you have to go?
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
It's probably trivial.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Uh...sure...I...what?
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
I believe in you.
Claire...
This is the person...you were talking about?
What time did you make it for?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
You have to tell me who did it.
My secretary?
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
What did you hear?
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
I hope so.
Something he said, just before...
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
You raised me, like a son.
Just open the door, please.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
I didn't know what else to do...
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
What do you mean?
Please, the children.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
What's the...OH SHIT!
What?
When's your birthday?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
Comfort.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
What about after?
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
And what's that mean?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
We millionaires yet?
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Of course.
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Oh, all that work.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Pants.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
Child, take a bite.
How is he?
Engaged.
Yeah, you met her?
Don't curse.
There you go.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
That's not it.
That's ridiculous.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
It mattered, Mom.
Camille, she'll be fine.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
You're cold?
Sort of.
That was two words.
Why are you up?  Get in bed.
Four days.
No.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
I know.  But chances are...
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Thanks, Sidra.
What's that?
How's that been?
I never knew a girl that could play.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
Your Dad play?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
You do act different.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I don't like flowers.
Five seconds.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
I know this.  What do you want?
A ride home.
Please.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
So she's honest.
Would you watch the damn road?
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Good.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
You sure?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
Plan to.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
She understands.
I...can't.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Hey, what's up.
Are you out of your mind?
You forgot to be there.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
What are the doctors saying?
Not for Quincy McCall.
Kiss my ass.
Oh yeah?
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
So...how's the knee?
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
So why'd you give up ball?
We need to talk.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Your heart.
So?
Hey.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Keep your voice down.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Sorry.  You okay?
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
You know, people.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
I just told you.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Look, I'm busy.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Yeah.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
In my sleep, Burt.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Well what's the situation?
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
My mother had breast cancer.
Oh that's good.
It was scary though.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
Don't sit down.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
LAPD. Open the door.
Yeah.
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.
It's fine.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
Thank you.
What's that stand for?
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Just Jim.
Eight o'clock?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Great, bye.
No, no.
I'm sorry --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yeah, of course.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
It's ok.
Yes I do.
Just say no.
You alone in there?
Claudia What?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
It doesn't matter.
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Ok.
Cynthia?
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
Son, don't --
-- no.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Put the gun down, please, boy.
DAD --
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
DAD.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Finish it up without the lip.
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Do you have love in your heart?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
Might of been before my time.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
You see?
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yeah.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I need to sit down.
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
Get a girlfriend.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Is Jack your son?
It's ok.
No.
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
-- just to clarify --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
And that's what you've heard?
Yeah.
I'm quietly judging you.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Around here.
And what did your parents do?
Well I guess it doesn't.
Are you close?
Right.
...this close...
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Kind of.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
...uh-huh...
When did he go off chemo?
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
I'm really sorry.
Oh yeah.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
The door was open, I got a call --
I am calm.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
You're here.
Are you lyin' to me?
No I Said.
Ok. What's your name?
I preffer to stand.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
What's this, how did this happen?
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
No.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I need you to get me Paula --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
Did you tell her?
It's not really pain.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No.  No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Who?
No one else that I know?
Just once.
Two years...three years...
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
But you can't say....
Are you her boyfriend?
I'm Bob.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
Saucy-saucy.
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Mmm.Hmmm.
mmm.hmm.
Yeah.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
What do you do?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
That's pretty cool.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
-- I didn't see you from the window.
See you.
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
Stand up.
Go to bed.
It's ok.
I have money.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
God smiled upon us.
And you were not hurt?
That is good.
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
I am preparing for a ball!
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
I wish to discuss your brother.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
He is nothing now.
Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Replace the king.
Making the key to the throne.
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
And people close to him, who --
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
But -- what is he doing?
About to hang himself, I should think.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
But --
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Pull them back!
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
That doesn't matter now.
There are more important things than tits.
Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
It is also a place of burial.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
We go someplace dangerous.
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
He is right, d'Artagnan.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Athos, my friend!
I heard your playing.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Oh my friend.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
To kill the king.
The King killed my son!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
Porthos told me.
Whose rooms are those?
How did you --
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
I decided it this morning.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
At least help Raoul.
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
... You knew you had a double?
Get out of my way.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
I am unhurt --
No, Keeper.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
I... we are humble people...
My dear, I've already done it.
Yeah?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
You set to go -
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Don't worry -
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Yeah...
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
I'll live...
And he took a swing at you?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Yeah?
What?  Wait a minute -
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Who is it?
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Up north.
You're the mysterious type, right?
No.
Only on dates?
You'll find out - soon enough.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
No, but I'm listening.
Found what?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Yeah.
Where the hell is my car?
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Jesus, man...
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Did you have sex with her?
County jail - get in.
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
It was you who did the asking.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
When do they go to press?
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
Why?
To recover the mind set.
You.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
What'd it say?
I won't be here.
'Changes?'
What?
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
For Christ's sake get him!
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
It'll do fine.
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
I'm fine, Francis.
Francis? Where are you?
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
Who?
The Tooth...
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, God.
Do you see?
'No' what?
You'll let me go now?
Dr. Chilton.
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
No.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Yeah...
Why do you think I called?
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Goodbye.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What would you call him?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
I love you...
I remember.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Can you quit?
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Will?  You could come up here.
You got a deal...
Yes. Is Molly there?
That's right.
Thanks.
Are you George Sherman?
My name's Will Graham. I...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
And Hobbs died?
You read about it, I'm sure.
I thought you would have some ideas.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You had disadvantages.
Yes.
Pictures?
No.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
Why does it feel good?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You got it.
I refuse.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Those are my terms.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
What's up?
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Yeah...
B-but I have them.
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Ten.
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No thanks.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
I'm here, ain't I?
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
If you want...
I can shtop whenever I want...
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
GET OFF!
Each show is worse than the next.
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
What is this, World War Two...?
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Positive.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I'll take my chances!!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Yes.
SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Know what?
They won't make it.
You all look the same to me.
That's the third white van I've seen.
Right...
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
You don't, do you?
Hear what?
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
Really?
Five.  Since I've been here.
Dead.  All dead.
I got you.
Yes.
Goddamnit!
They'll be able to track it.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Yes.  Now.
Yes.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
How?!
Go!  Now!
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
... Yes.
I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
Why not?
I know exactly what you mean.
More important than what is when?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
Your mind makes it real.
What -- what lesson?
I think I do.
How?
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
What's going on?
Yes.
That I would find the One.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
Who are you?
I just thought... you were a guy.
They're watching you, Neo.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
That's different.
... right as rain.
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
What choice?
I have to.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Zion?
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Duck!
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
He's alive.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Sounds good.
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Why?
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
Kennedy.
So?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
You flew before?
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
What do you mean?
I don't like loading crates.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
No.
That bad, huh?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
How much?
How much was the original loan again?
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Fine.
I know.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Bye.
No you weren't.
Yes, you did.
Ok.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
Teresa.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Wha?
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Well...
Anything specific?
Don't ask.
A paper on that one too?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
The green capsules in the top drawer.
The girls like it loud.
 Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, I think so.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You mean it's heisted.
This is a heisted car!
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
You what?
Quiet please.
Can you spare it?
Sure.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
His wife?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
He's cute.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Annie made them.
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
Do they, m'dear?
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
Yes, it is.
Honey --!
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
What will I tell Annie?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Right away.
What 'business'?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
He'll wait --
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Me, too.
As close as a deal could be.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
What?!
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
'Just kidding'?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
You get not to go to jail.
Well, that's very interesting.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
He was interested.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
'It's up to Joe'?
That's what he said.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
He said that?
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
Confused, huh?  About what?
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
But she loves you?
Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.
That is not my intention.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Come again?
I've got plenty of friends.
Yes?
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Be sorry for nothing.
I appreciate you --
And I appreciate you, too.
I am, too.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
Gay?
To bed.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
Then don't.
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
'Threw' you?  Where?
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Good morning, Bill.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
Yes?
You've got a deal.
Of course.
There's one to every rule.
Not this.
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Why didn't you stop me?
I guess...
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
I'm her father!
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
'Spooning'?
This universe?
I told you, 'watch it'.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Yeah.
Not at all.
I was just asking, Bill.
Then what is it?
Which is what?
Are you threatening me?
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Thank you.
That's life.  What can I tell you?
That's me.
I didn't ask any question.
I don't!
I'm sorry, I --
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
It's enough now.
'Take me'...?  Where?
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Thank you, Quince.
Next week?
Yeah, I give a shit.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
How did you know?
Yeah.  I guess so.
...Then don't.
Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
I know it's none of my business --
So what's wrong with that?
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Raise away.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Then what will you say?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Joe?
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Why?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
I think I know her.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Condition?
Amnesia?
What's it like?
Seen you together, that's all.
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Just two. So far.							  *
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
Who did this to you?
You did.
Thanks.
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Do you remember me?
Quiet!
I don't want blood on them.
You did explain, Lenny.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Why?
You know what we have in common?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
So I just take your word?
What?
Such as?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Who did he go to meet?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
What are you gonna do?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
I have this condition -
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Thanks.
What?
A BEER, please.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I'm not appealing the decision.
Thank you.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
You said you were leaving town.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
You're living.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Shut it, Teddy.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Who's she?
Why are you following me?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
What sort of questions?
I have money.
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
No. You took them out.						  *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
He any good?
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
What do you think?
We're not certain!
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
Later!  Do you dance?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Why?
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Really?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Of course.
No.
I know.  And now?
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
Like...?
Verdado.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
"Salutations from the south..."
But what does your intuition tell you...?
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Define small.
You set this up!
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
The Statue of Liberty.
Must be some mess back there.
I show you what problem --
Same all around! For my friend, too!
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
Yeah.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
No. You got it.
Get lost.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
...He had a bald skull and...
History, man, history. How much?
Two kilos.
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
How's your hernia?
Ziat!
Oh Jesus! 
Sure.
About ten kilometers.
Sixty Lira?
Sixty?
How much?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
...She was on the plane.
Lucky girl.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
How long?
Hello.
What do you mean?
Jimmy?
What?
I know where it is.
Yeah? Where?
His radio Back of his open, radio...
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
You're right.
My passport!
What is it? . . . Billy?
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Learn what?
Mr. Yesil.
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
Did you ask for bail?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Shit.
New York's finest.
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
The Department of Public Health...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Across both tracks!!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
You know what I mean...
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Right.
Susan, we're not b-
Toss the flare down!
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
Just do it!!
Your arm, you can't...
You the bug lady, right?
She used a baster.
What do you want to know?
How long...?
Will I be able to walk?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
What's it about?
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
No, what is it?
Then the roads are open...
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
I'm...
Yeah, thanks.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Yes.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
No big deal.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
I can't write this anymore.
I'm telling you, I can't.
Nothing.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Well, it certainly says you.
To Misery.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Maybe.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Just from his agent.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
What thing?
He's your client, huh?
I'm sure you're right.
You're still a writer.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
What else?
Well, that's good, isn't?
Then don't say it.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Lovely.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
What are you talking about?
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
I knew where it was.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
More like two-two point two million.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
..in the building...
I hope there's a place to land.
What can we do' mate?
No.  Should I?
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Uh-huh?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Care to wait a decent interval?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for everything.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That they're lying.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
Something like that.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
You don't trust me.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
Affirmative.
How do you suggest I go about it?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
No.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Like what?
What did you think of him?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
'Terrorists?'
And then what?
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
You mean it'll be difficult.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
Yep.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
They'll kill me.
You're right, of course.
Okay!
And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer.
Krieger.
Take off your coat.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
Go secure.
Whos dead?
Yes.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
Yeah.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
It's quite out of the question.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Like Job?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
I wouldnt worry about him.  Once youve got the money -- hell find you.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
My contact is extremely shy.
Jack.
Give me a break, Pops.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
No, were going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
I'm willing to take the chance.
What problem?
He's our guy.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
How did Kittridge do it?..
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
You got it.
Dont flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Ethan - Ive always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Why don't you take a look?
That's what we do isn't it?
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
Thank you, Rose.
His brother.
And go to confession.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Pop, I got news.
Ti amo.
You look tired.
I'm getting married.
Again?
Yeah.
I won't come.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
It's temporary.
Let's go tell your Mother.
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
You have too many dogs.
Yes.
I'm going to marry him.
Excuse me.
I like it well done.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid.
Seven years ago.
How many men since then?
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I'm telling you your life!
Stop it!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Where are you taking me?
To the bed.
That light.
You don't get along with anybody!
You ruined my life.
Oh no I didn't!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
What?
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
It's the best thing there is.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
How can you ask me that?
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
I'm freezing to death.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
No. I'm gonna wait.
Yeah, I'll be in.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Maybe you're right.
I shouldn't.
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Seven-thirty.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
A month from today?
He's my younger brother.
How was your plane ride?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
No. He don't.
Did he tell her?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
No. Are you drunk?
WHAT!! She was dying!
What sins have you to confess?
That's a pretty big sin.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Alright.
I came right from the airport.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
I don't know.
But absolutely!
Sure!
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Go ahead.
Sure.
I guess you can't invite me in?
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
It's a house.
He's a plumber.
What? What?
It's Cosmo's moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
What would he be doing down there?
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
...What?
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
Please!
I'm not interested.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
And not too expensive.
What is that?
What, "is"?
None shall pass.
What?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
My liege,  I am honored.
Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Ni, ni, ni!
What does it say?
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
I am an enchanter.
You know my name?
Quite.
You got us all worked up.
Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
Yes.
Yes, I see.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
And therefore?
I feel happy... I feel happy.
What is your favorite colour?
Blue.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
I think I could pull through, sir.
Farewell, Concorde!
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Father, lad.
I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Got it?
No ... just keep him in here.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
What?
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Camelot ...
Oh ... hello ...
We'll cover your escape!
Look - I'm fine!
... I Bet you're gay.
Ector.
I'm sorry, I must go.
You've come to rescue me?
He's come to rescue me, father.
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Look.  I'm warning you.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Shut up.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
I speak as I find, Archie.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
You know what I mean.
The good-looking one.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
You know nothing about her!
Aye.
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
It's what the maids are for.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Louder, girl!
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
Are you all right, Barney?
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I see.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
By whose authority?
My own.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
Her Highness' Equerry.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
I'm fine.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
I wouldn't know.
Surely --
Then I envy yo.
I do what I do.
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
See what?
No loyalty.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
She'll never understand it.
Ma'am.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
What?
Those, over there, there.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I am told so.
What does he know about the Highlands?
That doesn't make him an expert.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
I'm breaking no promises!
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Because I have to! 
I came as quickly as I could.
Is that not enough?
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Has he been hurt?
We were expecting you to return by six.
Again?
Read it!
I have no idea.
From whom?
Why is he not here?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
What is the matter with him?
Sure.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
It's the game, ARCADE.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
We are talking...
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Sure.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
Like the fractals?
The Police, then...
I don't know.
Dante's Inferno.
You didn't hear me?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
We're actually inside, aren't we?
You've got the schematics, check.
Right, then...
Well, it's a long story...
Then we'll go home.
Is that your question?
You have no time.  What is your question?
Not yet, honey...
That's impossible.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
Can you say anything but "cool"?
I'm going home Cynthia.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
And?
But I'm not broke.
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
Cynthia...what's going on?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
Yeah.
Sure.
I agree with what you said...truly.
What did I say?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
Okay, I'm thinking.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
Okay.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
You got it! See you later honey.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
But it said #12.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Okay.
Maybe it's not me.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Those men in front, in the car.
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
Oh boy.
Right then.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Interesting.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Not a coke or anything?
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No...
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
No !
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I don't know.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
McCay knows ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Let's go.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Great...
Yes.
That was eleven years ago.
Hey , Hey !
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
Because of my charming personality ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look...
What the fuck are you talking about.
Ow...
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Don't have to tell me twice.
Don't eat at the console.
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
Not yet.
When I think you're ready.
No.
You did.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Checking........
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Of course.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Sir ?
That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
I'm listening.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Excuse me, gentlemen
Do you want to go out with me ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Yahoo !!!!!
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Which one, this door is locked !
Zach from work ?
Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
No.
Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  "Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?" or "You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought".
Good morning.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Oh, just put it over there.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
What about giving the other guy a break.
What about living in the real world pal?
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
What do you remember about her.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
Could you hold on for a second? 
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Give my love to Shelly.
We have a baby?
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
How about a nice glass of milk?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Special effects?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Come on in!
It's just a corpse.
I know that.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
What can I do for you?
Then I have come to the right place.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Your mother?
I never met my mother.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
There's water in your bathroom.
You're so clever.
No THANKS!
Yeah, RIGHT.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Vada.
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Come and get it.
DON'T, come on!!!
...I dropped it.
In the tar??
Owh...
Here's Judy Garland!
Good. I mean...
He's an undertaker.
Nick?
Yeah?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
What's it for?
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
A secret, I like that.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Is that a yes?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Bye Niece, Vada.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
You couldn't?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Oh, sure okay.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
Do you know him?
Good for you baby.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
I'm impressed.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Yes.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Deceased.
Pardon?
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
No. Just, more activity.
Oh, how do you mean?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
It's nice.
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Want to what?
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Okay.
You can get the general idea...
Pointing upwards Look...
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Dad?
Ahh, maybe next summer.
She likes to play bingo.
Sorry.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Hi.
Get away, get away!!
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
What was my mama like?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Do you miss her?
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Thirty five dollars.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
For this class?
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Oh, Vada...
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Do you like her?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Come on sweetie.
Can we look around in your camper?
Uh huh.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Okay.
No.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
I'm allergic to it.
Uh huh.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Hurry!
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Uh huh.
No.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
No, I don't wanna.
Come on, it's fun.
You have no personality.
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
What do you think it's like?
What?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
So?
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
I dunno..
Not true.
Uh huh.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Okay on the count of three.
What?
Would you think of me?
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Something like that.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
We're about to find out.
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
You're butting in.
And you believe that.
Sure.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
That was Thursday.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
What do you suggest?
Major.  Dish.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
To belong to someone.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
You need a few dollars.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
You win.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
Hello.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
I just don't want to freak him out.
Don't you see...
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
I know Ben.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Nobody has.  So far.
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Mirrors.
Such as.
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
If you like.
Except for that.
It means a lot.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
A bad combination.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Well.  How come she didn't...
Well, it happens.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
If you find her...
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
MICHAEL!!
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
I see.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
You'll have to speak up.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
What did you say your name was?
She's going to rest now.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
His Word.
Who the hell is he?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Sure thing.
What crook?
Your brother?
How in the world did he get shot?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
A little. What do you need?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
Replacement party.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Bet the sheets are grey.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Does their hair fall out?
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
And before?
Do you ever do any writing?
I'm here.
I'm not sure. Where?
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Wrong.
I have to go. He sighs.
I know.
Oh.
That's what you said before.
Fifteen minutes?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Yea.
I see.
Linnea?
Yes.
You sound different. Is that really you?
What time?
Money's no object.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
You're not.
I mean...
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Depends on what I'm studying.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Just a minute.
Why?
What?
I know a couple.
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
I see.
I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
Yes, you are.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
By all means, knock yourself out.
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
You've heard of it?
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Ain't love grand.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yes, sir.
It's video.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Manson beat you.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
She sings? What does she sing?
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
On average forty million.
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
No. Not really.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
You made every day like kindergarten.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
And they made the first move?
Unfortunately, yes.
Only on a much grander scale.
Just for fun, I guess.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Jesus...
Next week's episode.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Perfecto!
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
And me.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
You think so, Frankie?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
No. You got the wrong idea.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
I been sendin' her money.
Make sure he gets those shots.
People seen him 'round.
Just so you do your work.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. On the section gang.
You work around town?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Yes, aren't you?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Go on - you can have one!
That's right.
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Scared, huh?
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
No.
I didn't know you had one.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
You still didn't answer my question.
My kids want me to teach them.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
How come you keep askin'?
Yeah.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
Who're you?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Great.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
No, thanks.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
What did you say, boy?!
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Guess it's never been easy.
I guess I ain't.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I guess not.
Don't look like there's a right way.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
It's for your own good.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
I understand.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Like hell you ain't!
Right here.
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
Don't play with me.
If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
And how do you suggest I do that?
What does this have to do with me?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
I'd say you were full of shit.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Good, because you've got a new one.
You son of a bitch...
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Dixie McCoy
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
The access code to your mainframe.
Yeah.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
All things possible in Babylon.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
What?
No problem, amigo.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
How long, Dixie?
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
No!... No...
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
I had to limit your options.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Couple of months.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
I'll be okay.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
You're out of time, man.
Shut up.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Why do they listen to Guy?
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Right. 7:30.
Oh. I forgot.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Right. Right.
Who told!
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Anita!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Sometimes opposites attract.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
You crossed over.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You've done five of my ideas.
A--flack jacket.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Kristen got a quote?
Uhh, no.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Don't you remember what they called you?
Rob. Please focus.
Little known fact.
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Oh I don't think so.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Thank you.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Oh--yikes!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Well, are you here with anybody?
I finally found my story.
Why?
Nah uh.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
We can handle it.
For this.
Yes.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
No.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Who's Lisa?
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
Oh, please...
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Are you nuts or something?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
I don't know.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Make a left at this corner.
What do you mean?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
I'll get over it.
yeah, I had a bad night.
There's nothing to figure out.
Why won't you talk to me?
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I killed him!  I killed him!
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
I can't!
Hi.
You okay?
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
Sure...go ahead.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
He's full of shit.
That's right.  I don't.
I had such an awful dream.
How's your hand?
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
Do you still...see each other?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
He's real.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
That was different.
So?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
I don't do that shit.
Those are ancient history.
I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
Restless.  Very restless.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
That's right.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Doesn't matter.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
Try me.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Your dreams?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
What about Kristen?
How do we get in?
Mary Helena.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
Freddy.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Of course.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Me too.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
I'm not listening.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Orange juice -- probably not.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Oh right.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
If that's all right.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
I thought you were leaving.
Let's go in.
Yes, you did.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
This is the place.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Eleven.
Yes.  Always have had.
Big feet -- large shoes.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Oh.
Stay forever.
Undressed like this, yes.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
What's your name?
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Miracles do happen.
He wouldn't say.
The movie star?
Yup.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
Right. 
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
And we intend to use them!
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Me?
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Right.
Ahm... Bernie.
The others?
Yes?
Well, fire away.
Who?  Someone famous?
That's right -- Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Not classic, no.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Buggered?
Really?
She's perfect, perfect.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
So not over her, in fact.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Right.  No one else?
Absolutely not.
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Maybe.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Just take my work for it.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Three.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Bad news.
What?
What book?
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Tell us about it...
No! No! No!
Mister Washington.
Mister McMurphy!
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
On this ward?
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right!
Yeah?
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
O-o-o-oh...
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
Yeah, kid?
Ca-na-da...
Yeah, Mack?
Where ya goin', Mac?
Hey, what's that?
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Me too...
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Now, what would I be trying to say?
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
I refuse!
Scanlon out!
No!
Just wait till you hear...
Gary Blinker...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Oh, do you do much fishing?
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Oh, what was that?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
You bet, Doc!
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
All I'm askin' is...
How do ya know that?
Ten bucks.
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Okay. Who else?
'Kay...
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
To help you relax... please...
Yeah...
Are you a doctor?
Big man!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Oh...
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Now you talkin'.
Take you han's offa me!
No way...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
That!
He's dead.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
What's she doing?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
No.
Yes.
You're sure...
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
What's mezzaluna?
Wait.  I have to write this down.
But, Faith--
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Amazing.
Hm.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who's this?
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
I'm in love with you.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
You didn't answer my question.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
So?
So it wasn't real.
Because I don't have the right name?!
Tell me.
I don't know if that's such a--
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
No.  I just came by to apologize.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
There's no such thing.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Yes.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Uh huh.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Mommy, this is Faith.
Let's face it.  You want me.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he gay?
So?...
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Yes you did.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Is that bad?...
What about your job?
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
You're coming with me?
What?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
So?
What'd you find?
A phone message.  Only--
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Sorry.
Sure you did.
Nope.
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
I meant about my idea.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Why?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
What about Peter?...
You sure you'll be okay?
I'll be back before you leave.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
And he is living proof.
When you could've found one in America.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
I'd love to.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
That's exactly what you are.
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
You said it differently then.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
She's not here.
Where is she?
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Good strategy.
That's really romantic.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Gimme.
I'm not thirsty.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
I know. I know.
Don't say that!
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
See! You don't understand!
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
What makes him so special?
I better see you get there.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
The moment I saw you.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little  I better get you home.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I don't know.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
That was nice of you.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
Hit me again, Mac.
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
What made you want to be a fighter?
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
But that's living like an animal
What for?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
I know what you want me to do!
Get away from me.
Edie, Edie, I...
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Get out of my way.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Terry...?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
You go to
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Nice fellows.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
What do you think?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top oor the folks are usually out.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
Yeah, really!
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Looking for me?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
You was a Golden Warrior.
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
No.
No?
Easy. Easy, boy.
Hey look-
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
I got it. Hot off the press.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
I was only talkin' to her.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Look who says bum!
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
It frightens me.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Be careful!--They'll see you.
Those creatures..!
Don't let them hear you.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
Maybe so.
You love me then?
Tie them that they may watch.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Well then let us proceed.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
I'm so frightened.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
No, thanks.
Why not?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Who are you?
Yes.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
You were his what, his box?
His assistant.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
Why don't we talk about it later?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You're too late, Jack.
Oh, man.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
You at least bring the gun?
Uh-huh...
Now you're talkin'.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Or two.
Just hung up.
How long were you with the girl?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
They sure do.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
You'll have to ask him.
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Yeah, why?
What do you want to bet?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
I thought everything.
Hey.  You learn from doing.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Someone down here?
How many was that?
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
We still talk, though.
Sure.
Is that right?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Bleeding on a country road.
You'd probably tell me.
Yeah...
Really.
How do we do that?
Don't leave me.
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
What, as a sales rep?
How far do we go with this?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You know what I mean.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
So.  What's your point?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
The backseat.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
When?
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
What's to think about?
You goin' right back to work?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Meaning time came, I left.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
It's a guy you know.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Me?
Can I do what?
What-- when?
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
How you know that?
Flyweight.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Just a minute.
No.
The State Theater?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
He's still married though, huh?
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
"Hey, yourself."
I see that.
Off a tip?
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
You wave back?
I imagine you would've though.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
I told you, he isn't here.
Like a fag.
Likewise.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
You liked that?
Sir?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
Waitress!  Four beers!
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
I got a half a tank.  You?
We've always tried to beat each other.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
...He said that?
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
Well...sure.
From the air?
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Thank you, Sir.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
I was hoping to meet him.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
How did you?...
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Brilliant, Admiral.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
How do you like my hair?
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Go on. You can do it.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loudmouthed little bitch~
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Don't say that...
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Oh yeah?
Maybe I blocked it out.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You really love me, don't you?
Save it.
Charlie. About last nights..
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
That's real big of you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Just take a look at it. 
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
I'm trying.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
What would that be, sir?
I beg your pardon?
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
You don't?
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
What're you doing here anyway?
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I'd love to.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Evelyn, take her to her room!
Open it.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
He'll win.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Oh no!
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
I'm excused.
Oh. I forgot.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
I don't feel very festive.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
What was?
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
What if you're not here tomorrow?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
What are you doing?
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Like what?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What do they do up there?
You sure did...
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
It's been a few years.
I'm going out, Dad!
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Why not?
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Yeah...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Go later...
Right here, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
Bob...
Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
I said, don't worry about it.
You're going to the office?!
You're not smiling.
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
Close the law book.
No.
What's that mean?!
Of course.
A carrot?!
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Little baby girl.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Continue.
As in, the vegetable?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Fine.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
What's her name?
No. They didn't fire her.
It's me, you dork.
You're right.
Uh huh...
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
I still am.
What do you love about it?
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
A good start.
Gay movies.
Yes.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Really?
Hi, Mom. It's me.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Thank you. No more questions.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Right.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Were you pleased with his work?
We were satisfied.
That's correct.
We won.
What kind of people?
Aren't you?
Who?
Since when?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
That's perfectly clear.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Any women on board?
Yes, we did.
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
Charles...
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
<u>What</u>?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
'Mean the whispers?
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Get out of our way.
You sure you can keep --
As fast as you can.
We can't make it.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
Not sure. Ten?
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Which means he went toward sunrise.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Like my pistola.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
Just shut up, okay?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
For now.
I would rather we all stay--
Rain.
Which half?
SULEIMAN!
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Well, you got the big gauge.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.
About the girl.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
What do you care?
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
What, it's broken?
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I apologize.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Right now, if you like.
Neither do I.
Where did you learn to do this?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
You didn't think so then.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Well, maybe they're not.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Geiger counter?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
That way.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Sustained.
Show this to the President.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
What is it?
I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
He wouldn't leave her.
The Hunt Club.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My name is Taylor.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Mind your tongue, madame.
With one of them.
What about it?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Of course.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Sure.	In a cage.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Which one?
Second from the left.
You want her that much?
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
Why not?
It's humiliating.
We can't.
He doesn't know.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Shaddup bitch.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
What?
I got one...
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
Feelin' good's good enough.
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
Dawn...
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Sounds like it.
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Right...
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I really don't know.
I don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.

Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
What did you say his name was?
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
No thank you.
I don't.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Certainly not to me.
Why not?
They know you here--know your name.
Then he's-- 
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Anything I can do about it?
So have I.
They're going to arrest me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
This must have cost a fortune.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
You-killed-him?
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Magruder does.
Do you think I was faking?
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Right, Miss.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
I've never been to Florida.
Is it a crime?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
We try to be decent.
There isn't anything you can do.
What does he see?
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
To do what?
But even if you were in love with me.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Morning. Any calls?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
You mentioned information.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Fascinated.
Yes, I've seen it before.
Quite sure you had no motive?
No.
I don't.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Could we discuss that some other time?
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
You asked me where it all came from.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Recently, then.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
What do I get for it?
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
Where's the shell?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
So?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Warm water, no doubt.
Positive?
Not quiet yet.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
It does.  May I go now? 
Now, you're being beastly.
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
How about Magruder?
That leaves two strangers.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Ye have, have ye?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
What are my orders, sir?
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
So-so.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
That's not very kind.
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
You already have the checks, darling.
Of course.
I told you she's just..
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
It's kind of you to see me.
He was delightful.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Yes.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
I will, thanks.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Keep me company.
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
And some of that.  Sorry.
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I thought it was tremendous.
I think it went on rather too long.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Oh yes?
Who?
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
He's all right, the professor.
Might?
Why not.
I know.  I'm sorry.
It's shit.
Let me see.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
I'm not sure.
Are you up to something?
Okay, I will.
Suez.  1956.
I'm not here.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
Well, it's worth seeing.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
You'd look naked without one.
And that's why you never went pro?
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Sir?
I take the skin off chicken.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
What that?
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
This Zen master surfer.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
NOOO!!
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Warm them up.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
You're kneeling on my hand.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Something... in the trees...
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Well somebody sent them.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
You know you can't win this one.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
They never are, dear.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
No.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Yes.
What's that?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sit... and spin.
No.
So do day jobs.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
For an hour.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
What?
You know how to drive a stick?
Why?
Always.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Uh-huh.
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Occupational hazard?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
What?  Why?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Of course.  How much?
Five full nights... days too?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
Three.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I got a dress, yeah.
This isn't a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
I have work to do.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Please.
No.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
He's good at what he does.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Fuck off.
I really am sorry.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
What if someone tries to steal it?
Did you?
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Right.
Business.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
It was a business decision.
It was good.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
My what?
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Oh, god, what?
I'm here.
We're letting them slide?
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Yes.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Yeah.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
It was great.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
Do I!?  Momma!
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
You bullshittin' me?
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
Will I like it?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Then you would use your--
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Me?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Yes...
Excuse me?
'Scume me.
I swear it will be done.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
There will never be a need.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Did you say, "I do"?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
And a good thing too.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
Anybody want a peanut?
I thought I was going faster.
What do I do?
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
-- where?
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Yeah. It's really good.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-- well, when does it get good?
You want me to read this or not?
Okay.
Sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
Who won? How did it end?
Yes.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
And our assets?
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Light him.
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- anything you want --
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
Tell me.
No one of consequence.
I must know.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
What?
Inconceivable!
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
Oh, have it your way.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Hmm.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
An hour.
Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Scared.  Can't talk.
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Do the books!  Do the books!
Good, what is it?
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
But what if the play was a hit?
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I already have.  Come on.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Right.
You found a flop!
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Only if we ask him.
Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
To failure!
No way out.  No way out.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
But he has long hair!
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Very nice girl.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Ta.  Ta.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Nietzche...
Hindenburg...
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
What do you do best?
We won.
Groovy!
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Tell me all about her.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Very early. Dawn.
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Cash.
Not at all!
My mother.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Must've needed it.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Casharoonie!
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
All right.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
I don't need pills... just sleep.
A lot?
With the forty thousand dollars?
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Just what he told your detective.
Sure...
Lila.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
What thing could we be in together?
Is Mary... in trouble?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Maybe we can handle it together. 
She'll need both of us.
Where... can I stay?
Where's the old highway?
Arbogast said...
Sam! Why call when we can go?
You'll never find it.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Where could he have gone?
Yes. I think he would have.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Yes.
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Of course we will.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
This is the old highway.
Huh?
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
Bates.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
All right.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I haven't even been married once yet!
Sam, let's go get married.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You have a vacancy?
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
No, not like me.
Thank you, Norman.
Phoenix?
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
That's it. 
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Then I'm free to go...?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Maybe you saw Mary!
Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Fine.
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
Shut up!
Leave me alone!
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
I don't know, [I tell you].
You--a friend to me?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
You're losing your blood?
That called ... commanded ...
There's no child here.
You lie!
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Thank you.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
The body of Joan Gale!
Are you giving me this straight?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
You mean he was colored?
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
What do you mean?
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
It's all yours.
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! 
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
That happens to be the truth.
That's what they're going to ask you.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Good night, sir.
That is unfortunate.
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
But I have some friends waiting.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
He can't hear you.
You did.
I'm heading out of town.
Okay.
I could go out of town.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
A quantum one.
How?
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Is Rose here?
Where is she?
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
'Course it does.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Am I hurting you?
You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
Good night, Rose.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
But I don't know who they are.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
I don't want to know...
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, he's still up there.
What's taking the rascal so long?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
She's watching the car again?
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He kissed her.
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
It's Yankee whisky to me.
How could that be, son?
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
That's what she would say herself.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Go on, Doctor.
I think we both know her.
Yes, we know her.
How goes it, darlin'?
Oh. Did you say something?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Quarter of twelve.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
Well, good night.
There are more on the other side.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
I'm not hungry.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Yes, sir.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
What?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
I don't believe it.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Nothing, Rose.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Galley proof.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Illusions, Madam?
You're so sweet.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Incestuous.
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
What and?  That's what I got.
Now you know what to watch for...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
What'd I say?
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
That wasn't my fault.
What do you want me to do about it?
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Move it!
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
I'm just saying...
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Name one.
What about him?
What day is it?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
Bullshit.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Oh... okay.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Follow me.
No, we're stealing.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
Where have you been?
Maybe.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
I... I think I can... clarify...
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Who is that... ?
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
I don't think so.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
It's one of a kind.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
They're... around.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
But I have no sister.
I can't see.
Jabba's palace.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Yes, my Master.
As you wish.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
His lightsaber.
Luke!
How are we doing?
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
All set.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Yeah, sure.
That's all any of us can see.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Here's the terminal.
Lower it!
I'm trying!
You, too.
Good, I hate long waits.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
All right, hang on.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Your Royal Highness.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
But, why must you confront him?
I know, father.
So, you have accepted the truth.
If that is your destiny.
There is no conflict.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
I will not fight you.
Yes.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
I told you, my car broke down.
Janet.
Janet
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I've got something to say.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
We must have a blow-out.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Makes you cry
Free to try and find a game
Dealing
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Oh no no no no.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
You're too kind.
Oh, lucky him.
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
Ohh!
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
...I suppose.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
I don't think you're a bum.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
I sold them to you.
D'you really wanna call?
I'll call your brother.
No, I don't belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
...What?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
It did.
-- The legs.
What're we going to do?
...I dunno.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
...Like you?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
That so.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
One more round.
...Thanks.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Move your shoulders down.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Six!
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
I agree.
Creed is down!!!
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
What's happenin' here?
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Bob.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Do I have to pay juice?
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Rocky.
No -- Just me.
What?
Stuff it, man!
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Why?
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What?
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
...What?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
...Tomato?
The legs must be goin'.
...No.
Yeah, sure.
Message -- What message?
Here's the card?
'Bout an hour ago.
What's happened is freak luck.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Ya got heart.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
It ain't your locker no more.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
What?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Hey --
I'm thirty myself.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
It don't matter.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
Whatta these guys want?
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Is this paper even good?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
That's right, me.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where is he?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
What a gasser.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
So what do you want me to do?
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
I've already seen your photographs.
Maybe.  Why?
Stop what?
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You tricked me, damn you!
Divorce?  Never!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Yeah, that's better.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
My brother.  Get inside.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
Only time will tell.
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
By my head here come the Capulets.
But new struck cuz.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Art thou hurt?
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Romeo, come forth.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
[Within] Juliet!
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
What wouldst thou have with me?
I don't know.
Well I don't!
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
That's him.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
You were a soldier, were you?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Shut up!
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.
There's been a slight problem.
Of course.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
I don't have it with me...
Bullshit!
I swear...
So what do we do?
Don't cross me...
Really?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
You seem one to me.
Gets the job done.
Long enough to shoot back.
Why don't you go do better, then...
What a surprise...
Eat shit and die slowly...
You should learn a little patience.
Not in mine.
As in, they own it?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
There is that.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wanted to see who you were.
Who am I?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
But you can't.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You see the bullet?
I know of him.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
How could you have done that?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Something like that.
So I do it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Would you stop with that...
Why not?
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
Do you have a good answer?
I'll work on it...
You speak French.
I know.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
I'm sure.
It's the Irish tape we want.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
Dwayne listen to me -
I don't know what you're -
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Why?  Are you kidding me?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Well someone's gonna find them.
Hell, it won't be us!
Because...I know.
At the expense of six people.
Maybe.  Who cares?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
It's the right thing to do.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
It's gonna be o.k.
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Do you have everything?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
That's right.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Uh huh.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
What are you doing, Earl?
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
He's irresponsible.
I might have to look into that...
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
OK.  I love you.
I'm in here.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
How the hell did he find it?
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I don't know, Booth.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
I don't believe it.
I have a better plan.
What are you getting at?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Why would someone do that?
Hi.
Anything...specific?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Oh.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Take it or leave it.
Sort of.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Yeah whaddya want?.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Watch that.  Watch that tone.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
What?
Well you can't have it.
We're gonna talk.
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Yeah.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
You do?
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Absolutely positively.
Give me the bad news.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
There was more than that.
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
What do you think?  Heart attack?
I'm not getting an answer.
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
So tell me what you know.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Lee, you okay?
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
I'm sorry.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Don't look at my ass!
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Not Yu.  You!
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
What?
You said --
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
You pull a muscle or something?
Gimme the binoculars.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Why did you help me?
See you in the next world.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No mu-shu.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Steamed dumplings?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
What is Mac out?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No problem.
Yes.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Excuse me?
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
How do I know I can trust you?
No.  But I'll help you.
Now you know.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
It's my responsibility.
Did you tell Sterling?
Thank you.
Yes, Master.
No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
I know, Master, but...
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Shut up!
OK. Say what it is.
The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
Sir, I can explain.
He was just doing his job.
A little.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
What plate?
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
What?
Come on!
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Yes, I think so.
No, fish is a PM food.
This concrete?  This is still America.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
What?
The art.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
I could get promoted right out of here.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
It's okay. For restaurants.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Not to me. Never to me.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
What?!
Or somethin'.
Ambassador Han.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
You don't understand this guy.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
What did he ask?
Good one!  Thanks.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
It's hurting.
He's here!... He's here!
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Where do you think she's going?
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Oh, please!
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Thank you.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
A pre-wedding luau?
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Cindy the manicurist.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Still sweet.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Yes.
You humiliated me!
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I love you, too.
Me?
Well, you do have the dress.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
What happened at the luau?
It's for the bell.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
Yeah.
Is there somebody else?
Nope.
It sounds nice.
But it's on the water.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
-- who's married to --
Am I what they had in mind?
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
What is it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Actually, he sounded nice.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
Listen to this, I love this part --
I know.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
What?
Is this crazy?
Good night.
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I know. 
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Yes.
Howard.
What?
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Any time.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Are his folks nice?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
What?
It's a sign.
Grace heard it.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Who is this?
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
Have you had any relationship since?
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
I don't think I could really describe it.
Why not?
Why not?
Fair enough.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Right, right.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
You'll like it.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
It's a spice rack.
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
It plays in 50 states.
Dad --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
What?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
Good.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
It's a sign.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
Are you going with her?
Yes.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
It was all they had.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
What about it?
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
I think they're announcing your flight.
Hi.  Sam?
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Hi.
You did?
You could have called me --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Sure.  Sure.
You're welcome to one.
How's it going?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Who? A scab?
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
Got to talk to the brothers.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Antonio paid for it.
No.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Sure.
I've had them since the day they were born.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
You weren't waiting for me.
Hunting.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
You know I don't think that.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
I thought maybe you forgot...
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
You've got to help around the house!
You should have helped her without being asked.
What can I do for you?
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
How about in the house?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
It's downright classy is what it is.
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Everything go?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Ouch.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Colette ...
Nothing.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
How far out of town?
Nothing.
It gets me through the day.
Therapy session is over.
I need my paycheck.
I just can't. Okay?
Why?
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Lead the way.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Can you set that up?
10%.  That's ...
He doesn't have one.
Sure, Jimmy.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy.
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
That was my idea.
Understand what?
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
Hey, okay.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Why do you say that?
I'm sorry?
What?!
Uh-uh-uh ...
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
I'll keep that in mind.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
No last name?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Tell me what?
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Who is it?
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
That would be me.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
I was talking about Miles.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Better than drugs.
...alright, let me know when.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Not where I come from.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Cap'n...?
I guess.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
My guess, too.
Sarge?
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
Same place we are.
But, sir...
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
You?  Leading a squad?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about the company?
I've got a line on one.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Maybe.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Yup, hell of a mission.
It doesn't take this.
How about I go right, sir?
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
Have it your way, Captain.
Get back to your positions!
I coach the baseball team, too.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Alright, come with me.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Lingerie.
Captain, he's fast!
Understanding the following rights...
That's right.
For going to school?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
But you never had a first date.
Going out as friends.
I'm gonna call her.
Lloyd, give it up.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Okay, I got it.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
I admit nothing.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
I already did.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
I am.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I can put that together.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
I'm fine.
I know that.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Dad, I love him.
Just finishing up in here.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Busy?
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Yeah
Sure I do.
Watch out for that glass.
Twisted?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Won't you see me later?
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Yeah.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah?
Am I wrecking my car?
This is so noble.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
What?
I know.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Uh... okay... um...
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Are you?
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Just her name.
Hang tough, Lloyd.
How you doin', brother?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
He is.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
It's a beautiful city.
I'm sorry to hear that.
In Breslau.
They're mine!
Yeah, what's that?
True.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
That's great, thanks.
Nice things cost money.
She's good.
Things are great, things are great.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Something they can hold in their hands.
They should be.
Yes.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
They're withholding payment.
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
You'll lose money.
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
They've broken their pattern.
What is it?
Stop it...
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Who is this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
Finish what my son started.
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Definitely Whitney.
Yeah.
It's under control.
No, it's not.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Good question. You took the bait.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
What guy?
Randy somebody.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
Youre the one who got away.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And now, drum roll please...
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
So we found a compromise.
Or it found us.
Tails.
Miss Weathers.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Yeah?
What are we looking for?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Yeah, right.
Don't worry...
Dewey, there's no such place.
I don't play games.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
My morn was a Delta.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Don't do this.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Thanks, Joel.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
Gale?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Melinda McGraw?
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Who is this?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
What?!
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Reaction to what?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
There's more.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
How is that good news?
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Where are you Dewey?
They've got her!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
What about me?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Who is it?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
There a story in that building?
Bitch.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Just because you knew her?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Huh, fine.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
I'm hanging up right now.
Roman that's not the line.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
Who is this?
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
No, it's not.
Where the fuck did she go?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Are you serious?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
What number are you trying to reach?
To apologize.
What's that noise?
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Guess.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
What do you think I said?
Don't hang up on me.
Don't...
What do you want?
You getting scared?
No-bored.
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
Or else what?
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Turn off the light.
...please...
Please..stop...
But you're doing so well.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
No it's not. It was Jason.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
What?
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
He's not a suspect, is he?
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
What brings you out to these parts?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Shit.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
How is everything?
How is she?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Have you contacted the bureau?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
What is it? Where's Casey?
The phone's dead.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Forget it.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
And why would she do that?
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
She's saving herself for you.
And what would be your motive?
No, Sid.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Why are you doing this?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Later.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
I bet he's pissed.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
TATUM!
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
I'm in.
Announcing what?
So what?  This victim...
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Good.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
What are you talking about?
I read about it in the paper.
Hello.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Spit it out.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Shut up!
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Drop it.
Is there any blood in it?
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Totally unrelated victims.
Okay.  But, what?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
A switchblade.
No.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Satisfy our curiosity?
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
Call an ambulance.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Sorry about that... I just...
No.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
We don't know for sure...
Yes we do.  Here...
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How is this legal?
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
It's not what you think it is.
That is.
It was him.
We had him.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Kiss me on the lips.
There's no time to discuss it!
What are you talking about?  What happened?
Are you absolutely certain?
Oh... um, William.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't know...
I hate this city.
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
What, Ben?
I ain't wearing no gun.
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
How many, would you say?
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Yes, sir...
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
You got it with you?
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
And maybe you lie...
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, fust off...
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
If they're still alive...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Because she's my...my...
What's that?
What?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Over there!
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
It wasn't much of a letter...
It isn't fair...
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
You'll never get away from me!
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
It still worked in town.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Oh, damnit!
Yes, daddy.
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Cherry-red Tears.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
What?
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Yes, something was...
Tenth floor.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
And the title of this piece?
The title won't do.
Thank you, Ned.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Never!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
When I have fifty pounds.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
How much?
You're a liar.
Ned is wrong for it.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
No, no. You have a wife, children
And your relations?
yet cannot love nor write it.
Who is that?
Yes, I saw it.
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
That's me.
Partners!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
There's never any
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
I don't know. It's a mystery.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Who are you?
Every word.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
As soon as I have found my muse
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
The show must  you know
Wonderful, wonderful.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
What is the story?
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Ethel.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
I will.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
You admire it?
Can you love a player?
It is strange to me, too.
Even your play.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Mr. Henslowe?
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh--no, no!
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
I must. I must
That's my line!
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
You lie.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
Orsinogood name
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
I . . .
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Why, thank you, David.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I don't hear this.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Not now. I have an idea.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
I don't know.
Security.
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Yes, I suppose so.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Yes.
Yes, thanks.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
She hated you --
Well, she had problems --
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Alex.
What I am.
-- which is --
I think you're lying.
You're right.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Don't.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
I thought we all were.
I don't want to. It's different.
For ever and ever.
What's he doing here?
You were magnificent.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
You know we're right.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Oh, good.
Forget it.
Oh.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I'll wait there.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
You mean I can have the room?
No, nothing, sorry.
Of course.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
No.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
That's what it cost, David.
What?
It was on the television.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
You get the job done.
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
What guy?
That guy, the one that died.
That one, last week.
What's it about?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
No.
It's an improvement.
I'm a doctor.
For what?
That sounds fine.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Same as everyone else.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Or a fake?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Don't you like her?
Who?
What?
That you were just indulging me.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
No.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Why not?
But you don't know what happened.
Nummers.
I don't want to place you in any position --
What kind of treatment?
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
You're looking great, baby.
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
Yes.
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
Hello, George.
Right now, I just don't care.
... what?...
Nobody can hear it.
Uh-uh.
Her?
Are you?
Chopped liver?
Did you hear me?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
No kidding.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
Yeah...
I am not like my mother!
Yeah.
Right.
How is she?
And you need money?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Yeah.
Buffums?
You promised you'd do the show.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
I'm sure.
He's a very private person, actually.
You going to tell him?
You would?
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Yeah... wow.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Did Lester know about him?
Yeah?
Well, did you or didn't you?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
I know... you don't know, I know.
What are you talking about?
He's a director.
What about it?
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
I don't know what gets into me.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Nothing.
Me?
Not me, pal.
-- do you want ice?
Why?
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
I don't know... Jackie?
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
No, man.
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
What with?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- Oh yeah.
-- Oh my yes.
-- you know better...
-- how did you get here?
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Okay... thanks...
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Who?
George, I don't --
How?
You're great.
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I already said hello.
Going where?
Right now?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Who?
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
I just want to know, that's all.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
That's all you've got to say?
George...
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
Said what!
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
I see.
In a way. But...
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
I don't know what to...
Isn't that bad for it?
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
Well... who are those guys?
Well, what?
But...
Oh Jesus Christ.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
What, do you think I planned it?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Well, I don't know.
I know.
I'll have to wash one out.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
What about her?
No.
No.

A daytime soap opera.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
No kidding? Your own shop?
Fine.
Aren't you going to have one?
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Does she know about us?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
I'll call you.
See you later.
Anyway, you're crazy.
Who is that?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
I know, I'm sorry.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
We don't think marriage is important.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
What?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
... Mmm-hmmm.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
But why Egypt?
Is he an enemy?
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
-- no.
Good for you.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Of course not.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
No.
John...
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
They had to, in order to survive.
Yes.
Yes?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
Who's Tony?
Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Danny, come on over here.
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Yeah.
Okay, Mom.
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
To my stomach.
Yes, I'd like you to.
Advocaat is it?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
Who?
A nigger cook.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Good.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
I hope it's nothing serious.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Your money's no good here.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
It's about eleven thirty.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yes, I did.
And you didn't see anything at all?
I think he did it to himself.
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
You can't remember.
Jack...
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Why?
Stay away...!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
I'm gonna go now.
Oh, it sure would be
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
They'll love it.
I'm intrigued.
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
Well, my predecessor in this job
shut in together over long periods of time.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh...
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Hi.
Blue. This blue.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
You're a real booger, you know it?
Well... it is his third.
Rattling. Rustling.
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
No.
Huh?
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
Well... was it a prescription?
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
There! You see!
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
Oh?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Well... thank you.
Really?
You know, I just might!
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
Were you tempted?
And I'm tearful!
SING!
You know it.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
Vince...
Today was the deadline, Vince.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
You bastard!
Yes?
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
You betcha.
The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
I know.  It's ancient.
It's true -- I know her.
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
I knew that.
Wet behind the ears.
Tell me about it.
Hopeless I
You know?  About me?  About everything?
You re okay -- for a civilian.
What?  What time is it?
Five a.m.?
I... I brought you something.
A cigarette?
What?
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Now you.
Right.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
You watch yourself!
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Clarence!
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
You were unhappy?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Sit down.
Your cigarette -- out.
You mean black people?
Check your driver's license.
Can do.
I'm outta here.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
And whom would you call?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
What's wrong with my life?
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
No.  No.
You're my Olympic event.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Out of the question.
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
I must go where I can be of use.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
But...
Oh?
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
He didn't do you a favor.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Like what?
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You're not... seeing anybody?
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Nuns?
Yeah, like what?
Oh-huh.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
They open a window.
Take care of it.
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Not... totally.
Which one?
Where is she?
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
We're losing it.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Yes?
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
But how do we get there?
Christy.
But where?
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Find 'em!
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Not for lack of trying.
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
How could he?
Listen.
I hear nothing.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
What was she doing?
No.  They are all missing.
What books?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
Tired.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Small talk.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
If you want.  But...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
Must I hear this?
It was not butchery.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What has happened?
What?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
The skull is gone.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Where?
Let her go!
Turn around.  Now!
Yes.  Here...
In a way, yes.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
She did not do it... please listen...
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
I like them french-fried potaters.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
It's too big.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Don't tell me what to do.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
They let you out?
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
Yeah, I did.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I like the way you talk.
Yeah.
Where'd you get them flowers?
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Naw.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I don't reckon I know.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
A little ol' boy.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
I reckon.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Is that right?
Yeah.
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Did Vaughan go home?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I reckon.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
I'll be.
Yes ma'am.
Okay.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Yeah.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Not really to speak of.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Can I help you, sir?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Do you smell shit?
No, we have to get this story.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
Signs?
Will he be supervised?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
No! At least I don't think I am!
An invitation?
It's my birthday.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
What happened?
I'd love to.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
What's that, Sol?
What's the difference?
It's yours?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
He's crazy.
Fuck you, kid.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
You usually get two.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Every word.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I mean, it's a good story.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Yeah, like what?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
And you're giving it to me?
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I almost got married once.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
Open it.
And why the hell would you give me money?
It'll never be finished.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
I just want to know where he is.
I figured he had a right to know.
Those are pretty hostile words.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Thomas.
Baby? And what baby is that?
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
What time is it?
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
The inspiration.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Yeah, it might be.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, it seems to me...
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
And why.  Is that?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
You're right.  I better use two.
No, you don't.
You're wondering why I held it.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
I'll take two.  One for later.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
I think you like learning.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Does it now?
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
The same.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Not in those words.
He had no reason to.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Yes.  And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Bye.
Thank you ever so.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
What did he say?
Yeah.  Why?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
No we're not.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
With me?
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
They got the bull-fiddle.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
And I'm Daphne.
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
You tore it again!
Good night, Josephine.
I got pinched in the elevator.
And I'm not even pretty.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
I am.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Joe -
Okay, Joe.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
We're not on the pier yet -
Honey - she called me honey.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
If there's anything I can do for you -
No, no.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I'm not that sick.
You got some?
I'm fine.
Half-full.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
Vanity Fair?
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
I guess she's not in here.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
Thirty-four.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
You don't say.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Goodbye?
This is where I get off.
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
You're leading again.
Sorry.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
We won't breathe a word.
My car?  Why, you -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
William Morris!
No - funerals.
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
Better keep a lookout.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Men!
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Glasses?
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
Not at all.
Good night, Sugar.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
What makes you so sure?
You're not hurt, are you?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
What theory?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
If it's at all possible -
I am?
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
It's the thought that counts.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
What thing?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Why?
All right - if you insist.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Me?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Goodbye, my darling.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Big joke!
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
I cut myself shaving.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
You don't owe me no nothing.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Im fine. I promise.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
She did?
You are taking the piss?
What?
No, thats not it.
No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
Yeah?
So, whats your point?
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Youre funny.
Really?  Dont get too attached.
Of course he is. Im here with my new man.  I love it! Your magics already working. Let the suffering begin.
Im compulsive and weird?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
You stand on your tiptoes.
A wedding.
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
I have a friend at the magazine.
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
So whats with the nickname?
Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Therapist.
Im so sorry.
I get all the glamour jobs.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You want me to let him in?
Meet Nick.
Is there any other way to take it?
Will do.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Let me see it...
That does it...
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
That's right--
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
What do that mean?
She was dirty and wet...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
NO! N-O, NO!
You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
Yes, sir...
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
What happened afta that?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Mornin', Daddy...
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Sausage and hambones!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Same as we -- they pray.
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Did you find your father?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Yes, ma'm...
Come in, children.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Is he gon' be gone long?
I wanta get some things.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
Is there something I can do to help you?
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
My head hurts.
I hate the environment.
I said -
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Very funny!
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
What?
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Whoops.
No you can't Kenny!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Okay.    Not.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Oh.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Papa mama simi.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
What's the password?
Kyle, check it out.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
What's the difference?
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Sweet.
Are you sure, Kenny?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
I'm needing lunch.
Oh.
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
No, it was worse than that...
The F word?!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
You did? Just now?
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Hey, come here, guy.
I know.
You don't care.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
Check.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Anna...
They're not going to make it!
It can't be.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Oh, thank you.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
It certainly is.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
My...wings...
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Thank you.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Taylor, you surprise me.
That's me.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
That's right.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I don't know.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Simulated space walking.
I understand.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
What do you think's going to happen to us?
No...
I can't!
I'll do my best.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
And so far.
That's right.  Will you marry me?
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
That is one of my priorities.
Where's Taylor?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
You're not from around here, are you?
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Nope.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
He's my dad.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
La da da dalala...
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Think he bought it?
See ya 'round Faz.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Wish me luck.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
I got a right. You're my father.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
The small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I'm getting to like it here.
No...
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
I couldn't care less.
He says that to all his wives.
You're a scumbag.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Hello, mom?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
It depends.
You shouldn't touch her.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Who's there?
SHEILA!
You made me hurt him!
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
No!
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
Why would you help me?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Line up where you want it.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
He's no father to you.
Where can I find him?
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
I'm not here to - I can't...
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
What does he do?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do I want you?
What's plan B?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
So why do you stay?
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
You're here.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
He's dead Sheila.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Sez you!
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Basement bingo?
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Fletcher!  Now!
I can't...
I said back away.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
What was that?
Forty yards.
Norman, don't do it!
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
-- dating the crash at least that old.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
What team?
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
Just worry about yourself.
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
Damn it, Edmunds?
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Pull it.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
What the hell is going on here?
They've left, keep watching!
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
In a minute, sir.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
You don't know that.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
What's the message?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
He understands me fine.
She's not gonna know, sir.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Radiation shield, you think?
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
What sub?
That's quite a secret.
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Get this thing off me.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
We have a library?
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Beth --
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
Eggs.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
Don't bother me, Norman.
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
How can the sphere do that?
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
But why is he doing it?
Something for burns.
Valdomet.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Bingo.
How do you spell it?
What's that?
How fast does it take effect?
Beth --
Only lab rats.  Here.
What do you mean, different?
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
I did do that, didn't I?
Do you fear them?
Are you manifesting them?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
I never went in that sphere.
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
What?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
It doesn't make any sense.
You'd have to ask them.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
We can refuse to talk.
Fine.  I'm fine.
Look, would you --
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Gimme another explanation.
Am I?
Then what, Norman?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
You don't understand about the sphere.
You don't remember that?
Harry?
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
The three of us.
I don't think so.
Help me lift her.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
How far away's the sub?
I heard!  I heard!
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
You got her?
No idea.
Wait!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
You mean forget?
What is it, Harry?
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
That's right.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
"We are friends".
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Why's that?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
I'm not sure.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Not bad.
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
I know that.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Not any more!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
You mean we should go after her!...
Forget it, son.
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
It could be worse...
Did it occur to you they might find us?
With four casualties?!
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
They'll find its weakness.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Are you safe?
I'd consider it an honor.
What an honor...
Well, maybe you better look again.
YAAAAAAAA !
What about it, Diz ?
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Others are waiting.
Ace of spades.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
They revoke our flight status.
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Funny...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
I do.
Is it true ?
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
I'll meet you outside.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
You two have so much in common.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I'll go for that.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
Should I be ?
That was just a mix up.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
No way, ma'am !
How come we never got together ?
What ?
You got it.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
You used to dance...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Sir, yes, sir !
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
Yeah, that's right.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
What is it, Rico ?
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir.
Cover us, Ace !
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
To join with him.
They have repressed the Creator.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
Departure angle.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Engineering...
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
It's taken control of the computer...!
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
This served the purpose.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
A tractor beam...
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Viewer, standard ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Mr. Decker... ?
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
The point... 
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
We're ready, sir.
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
You haven't heard of it.
"Anguish."
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
Yes.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
But why the dalmation?
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
That whole...
I love your script.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
Well, first, you got to change the title...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
You got a paperclip?
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
...because if you don't, they die...
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
Yes.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
<u>Please</u>...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Hi.
Going home.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
...what...?
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
It does?
You'd do the newspaper right here.
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
Drama Group?
I beg your pardon?
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
He works on the movie.
What're you doing here...?
Town ain't got no courthouse.
What?
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Wat...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says <u>here</u>...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
I don't eat vegetables.
Bourbon and Milk.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with...
<u>Bobby</u>...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Could I see it please...?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
If there's anything I...
There's other things to be learned.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Then what is the...?
I wasn't in the car.
Who is her agent...?
But not that <u>way</u>...
That's my...
No, no...Please.
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Yeah.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
Yes.
An artist of your caliber...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Yes.
She won't stop crying...
Well.
Who got their heads cut?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug...
Arrest him.
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
Okay...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
I had a witness I would.
A witness to what...?
The writer.
You bet he did.
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
I...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
I know the feeling.
I grew up on your mov...
I don't getcha.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I...
No.
How do you know you saw it?
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
How was your flight?
They're coming Fedex...
I'm gonna' bring it off.
That's what I said.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Pay her off.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
There's no witnesses...
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Sherry, Sherry...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
Why would they be illegal?
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
Yes, I hear it.
Zat true?
Givvem a cigarette...
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
It happens.
During sex.
Then why are you putting on mascara?
She is but an arriviste.
I could help with the debate.
Good girl.
Oh, yeh.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Don't. Take me with you.
Let me be the judge of that.
You lost Ben?!
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
Thank God for that!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Honey, she won't d...
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Ice cold water.
That's my girl...
Don't take my picture!
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
Cos she loves you.
No!
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
I have lava.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Rachel's job is she works.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Where are you, anyway?
You have the WORST flu since...
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Is your bad?
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
No!  I have to get there.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Rache can do that part.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Remarried.  There is no move.
Because you don't really seem here.
Something's up wi...
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
We're not discussing your age.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
I'm worried.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Don't do this.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
It's a huge moment in their life --
WE are over.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
And we all went through that together?
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
I was in there in him.
Look, I...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I need practice.
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
You WHAT?
Nobody likes a snoop.
...it's my problem, too.
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Thanks, but it's under control.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
You mean, after I'm dead?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
What do I have that you don't?
I have their past.
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
For what?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Not yet.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
I know that.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
Because you've changed so much.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
He isn't.
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Hey. What's up?
There are some rumors...
You know...Stanley...
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Nice to have you here.
Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm always working.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Speak English.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
He's dead.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Yes, I do. I love them!
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
What?
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
I dunno.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Huh?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You know he hated my story also.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
The same.
Just the same.
We have to talk.
One in a million recover.
Thanks.
Hi, Dad!
Uh huh.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
No.
...gger.
OK.
I dunno...
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Oh, fine. How are you?
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Anything I might know about?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Yeah.
How many?
You know...I like you.
No, thanks.
What for?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Prnceton.
He did?
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
We're outta here--
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What happened!
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Yeah?...
There's the fence...
What are you talking about?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Are you going to kill us?
You're going to pay for this...
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
The transmission is an hour old...
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
He's in there...
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
What do you mean?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Drop the anchor!
Get your men to do it!
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Don't be ridiculous.
Yes, of course.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
That's right, sir.
You're right, sir.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
How much soda, sir.
Ask away, Major.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
And you'd like to see that?
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
They're coming in now.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Maybe it's an exercise.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
They're moving apart.
I think they mean business.
Yeah?
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Some kind of signaling.
What's your point, Lothar?
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
First safety.
Master Kong.
Master safety on.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Why should they call us back?
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Are you sure?
But I get a red light.
Roger.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Sure, King.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
It's really not about anything.
Oh.
Okay, whatever you want.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
And your mom.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Watch out for that tree.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
You know?
No. It didn't, Buff.
What?
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Yeah.
Am I fucking him?
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Are you talking to me?
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Please.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
No, no, whoa!
Hey, thanks, man.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You could do it.
Yeah!
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
Yes.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Mm-mm.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
What was your name again?
Erica.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
I'd love to read that.
Hi, I'm Erica.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Because I'm alienated.
Nobody. Sooze.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Oh fuck.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Will you just put the gun down?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Look, look, just get off my property.
You could've come over.
Yes.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
Your completely missing the point.
Yes, I stand for -
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Tim!
Oh, yeah?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Sooze.
And?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Mm-mm.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Mm.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Mm-hm.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Where are you going?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
Shit, Jeff!
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
What?
Just go.
Just go.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Now?
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
What do you mean?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Oh, yeah.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
What are you saying?
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey!
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright!
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Don't do that, man, okay?
Yeah.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
If you hit me...
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Oh that's nice for you.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
You just became a statistic!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Conan went to Harvard.
Wayne Gretzky.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
You sure I'm not fat?
We were told you could "fix us up."
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
Hannah, we've...
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Uh...maybe?
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
In a deep freeze.
Let it ride for a while.
What's wrong with it?
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Thanks.
I've been hoping to run into you.
I didn't.
Thank you.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Are you hungry?
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
What teacher?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
You sure have.
Why should you do that?
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Nobody can be that busy.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Come on, Joe.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Get out.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
You're a writer, you said.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Uh-huh.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
I will not have it butchered.
I don't know.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You can stay here.
I'll come early tomorrow.
You'll like it here.
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Cut away from me?
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
They've come for my car.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.

I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Who?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Great stars have great pride.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
This is the right day.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
You made her a star?
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Paramount studios.
What is it?
Have fun.
Eliminate her.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
I have to.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
We can't do that.
You don't like me? You hate me?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Terrific.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Like turning off a light.
That makes it worse.
Miss what?
I don't see why not.
She'll forget about us eventually.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
What?
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
She has hostages.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Well thanks a pile, fella.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
A passionfruit smoothee.
I know it.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
You vicious--
Well...I guess I can't.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Oh, no thanks.
Yes.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
Where is Earth?
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Thank you. You're very kind.
She's a beast.
It was just a trim.
It doesn't seem right.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
He's nice.
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
What? Me?
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I have to talk to you.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I don't scare that easily.
A cheap trick.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
That's home.
I was on Earth...
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Not enough vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Nope.  Never. 
Brad Wilson.
The kid needs a man to show him --
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
I mean him.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Me neither...
Old ties are hard to cut.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Well, aren't you excited?
Anyday...
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Sure.
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Oh?
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
I know, I'm the fault.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Who gets it, the company?
Yeah. A raise . .
Uh...
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
First question got to be "Where."
Just the man I wanted to see!
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
They ain't got captains?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
We've already got some.
You designed it?
Can you do that?
Watch out for them air pockets!
We gonna crash?
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
And do what?
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
What about me?
Anytime.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Turn on the light.
Gus?
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Storms! Floods!
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Today coffee----
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
Don't bet on it!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Maybe I could try --
Lois, you're amazing.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
I'm listening.
Say you love me.
Oh, hi.
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Uh...home...
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
North!
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Why didn't you go before we left?
What's a curl?
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
Now This I want to hear.
My kind of people.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
Shhhhhhh!
Australia.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Free!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
What shall we do now?
Stay. I will come to you.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
Clark. . . !
But Superman isn't an average man.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Absolutely!
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Yes, darling?
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
Superman gets mail here?
Who?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Our other dinner guest.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
I've been on the job.
It was hot, yes.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
I know son, I know...
North. It's north
Well!
Some people aren't the athletic type.
'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
Oh.
Don't you ever give up?
Not unless you can fly.
It wasn't a trick!
You're just jealous.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
No thanks.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
First the pets, Otis.
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
We just take it?
What do you suggest, my dear?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
You?! How about me?
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
What other one?
You can't do this to me!
Of course I can. I love you.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Then -
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
Two.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
I guess they are a little odd.
Oh.
195 pounds.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
On radio waves?
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
They'll soon be over.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally.  That's right.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
She's in trouble?
Say hi to Zoe.
I hope she gets better.
I'll tell her that.
No you don't.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Was it good?
It just seems...kind of weird.
I don't know.
The children.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
C'mon, you know that won't...
A while.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Well I don't.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
And they loved Bear.
From what?
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
No.  I saw it on his face.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Why would he be frightened?
I didn't say that.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
Isn't it a lovely day?
And winter?
Yes.  It's a present.
From you?
What's a ditty again?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Tell me about it.
How old is she?
Thanks.
Yes.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
Yes.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Why were you scared?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
There wasn't time?
You're going to blow everyone away.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Nothing.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
It's okay.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Nothing.
Okay.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
I guess you're right, but -
See my mother?
I only had a few hours.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Hurry back.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
No.  I'm going home.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
I didn't say that, J.J.
The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
When?
Get Steve back his job...please...
I read your column every day...
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Yeah!
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
He wants me to break a leg?
But what?
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Yes, but why?
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
Now listen to me very carefully.
No one must follow your work.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Liquid metal.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
You sure?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
You told me to.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Why?
What?
No.
You will.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
No!  Don't kill him!
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Correct.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Then what?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Can you get us in there, past security?
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Relax now, Sarah --
On Furtwngler.
Our duty is to help Furtwngler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
Eating is eating... and...
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
That's big of him.
Five minutes.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
With more what? More what?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
Three months.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
Of course.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
What's not right?
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
How come?
It's the truth.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Did you call someone you knew?
May I ask a question?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
I wish to say something.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
So. You wanted to see me.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
He did?
One of your people told me.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Sure.
Right. Claims assessor.
They said I was dogged?
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Like this bandleader.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Can you handle it?
You know your weapons, buddy.
Wrong.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Great.
I thought you did.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Right.
I don't understand...
What?
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
Okay.  Talk some more.
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
You must have had a fun child-
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Hot dogs?
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Oh, Kyle.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Yes.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Of course.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Who is in authority here?
Okay.
I hate the weird ones.
Send a unit.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Admittedly...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
I'll be right with you.
It was an accident.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
I'm sorry, about this...
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
You're the one who started running.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Okay.
I thought...
You?
What are you talking about... ?
What?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What do we do?
I'm back from the dead.
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
... what... ?
Guess you missed it.
I saw them kill him!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Stop it!
Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Big family... small?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
I redecorated.  What about you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Yeah.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
It's a profound life experience.
Do it for YOU.
I know...
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Split it?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
It always is.
I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
May I make two suggestions... ?
Physical?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
I'm not sure.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
I'm just like him.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
What's this about?
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Follow me.
Just what I told you.
Nothing else?
What?
Greetings.
Do we still get paid for the week?
You get your money.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
Luke.
No.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
That smell... oh, God.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
I don't know.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
What?
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
It's okay... we're all here...
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Who?
Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
Why?
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
So far.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
What do you do?
No.
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Red.  What else?
I have a loft.
I don't know, you know...
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
It's not a knock.
Like you.
Italian.
Who?
Sure.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
I'm a gracious host.
We think?
Okay.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
What kind?
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Huh?
Yeah?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Snuffed her.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Y'what?
I only asked.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
You goin' back inside?
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
What post office?
Same.
Really.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Hard to miss.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
How d'you mean?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
It was the bars, then.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Now who's being sarcastic?
How'd you manage that, then.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Depends, don' it.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
I don't believe it.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
Only in the movies.
He alive to see this?
What'd your father do?
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
It was you.  Downtown.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Where else?
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Sounds like you need a rest.
Yeah.
Which kind?
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
You do?
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
What do you think?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Is he here?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Who's looking for you?
You must know Ian.
Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
Tell you ...
Ann--
That's what he keeps telling me.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
He didn't say that.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
Birdy--
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Uh--
Sure.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
Way out of line.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
All right.
Mm.
How's business, Dave?
What is it, Dave?
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
OK.
Just coffee.
Honey?
Mm.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
So?
Honey...
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
He a good man?
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
What the hell are you talking about?
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
The hell with it, Eddie!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
You'll go to the prison hospital.
No.
Why not?
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
I don't want to scare people.
Calm down.  I found it!
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
Like hell!
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Mind if I have a look?
Whose footprints?
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
All right everybody, hold up!
I'd say we're in its home.
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
You're right.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Look who's here, Margo.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
Read it out loud.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
Keep the animal quiet.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
So what?
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
Maybe not.
You have time to talk?
I don't understand.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't know.
All right.  If you're positive.
They're all heavily armed.
What was it?
Wounded?
It's scared of me.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
How?
What?
You have to.  Do it now!
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
He gave it back to his father.
What have we missed?
It's just a matter of time.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Do it!
Thank you.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on "Tru Talk."
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
Why not?
Saturday?
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
I...I can't.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Trust me.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
I told you I can't.
Yeah...
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I know.
What's the hurry?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
You hate gambling.
There's been an accident, Truman.
I bet you did.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
That's not true.
Well, I made it through another night.
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
Things always do--when you look back.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
Were you there--how do you know?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
You're not FBI agents.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
When was that?
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Nothing completely conclusive --
Yes.
Brought on by what?
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
How?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
What did it look like?
That would be my guess.
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
What happened to playing a hunch?
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
All I told them was the truth.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
What kind of infection?
Mulder --
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
It looks pretty green for this climate.
And where are they going with it?
Where would they be going?
-- of what exactly?!
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
It may be extraterrestrial.
Very weird.
For the purpose of what?
I don't know.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You can't quit, Scully.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think... something stung me.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
And they want to blame us?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Is she alive?
I want to know where Scully is.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
What alien environment?
What about you?
My life is over.  Go.
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Lucien Baines?
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
No.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
Give a kiss to Edward.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
Like hell "wait."
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Yep.  Eloped.
Good for them.
It doesn't matter...
No problem.
No.  Thank you.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Delano?
You're kidding me.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Initiating connection.
I think that's the whole point.
What's wrong?
Absolutely.
No.
That's a secret.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
Considering where I've been...
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
He has a little dog.
Oh, yes, yes.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
His own doctor?
Mmmm.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
What's that?
Tell me more.
Anna.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I'm so sorry.
Me.
A parrot...Let it go.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
He liked to laugh.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
How do you know?
Why are you lying?
We loved each other, do you mean that?
It wasn't important.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Where's Harry?
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Good-bye.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
How will I know you?
Yes, of course.
Fellow called Lime.
Martins.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Schmolka!
Him dying like that.
It wasn't petrol.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
I can't. He disappeared...
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
I'm not asking you to.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
Which side of the road?
She's right. It's none of my business.
I said you win.
One can't just leave - please.
Take him to Sacher's.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Listen...
Yes.
Holly...
You wouldn't do anything.
As long as they can use you?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Sure...
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
What do you want?
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
At the end of every chapter --
What did he say?
But he said he died instantaneously.
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
How do you do.
Coming to the point, please.
English?
Yes, sir.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
Joseph Harbin.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Where are you staying?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Good morning.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Nice work.
We're ok.
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
A bit fucking late.
What happened?
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
It's on an island that no one get to.
You can swim?
Richard?
Hi there. Here, take a look.
Swim?
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Richard, you know something -
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
The Nazis did everything the fhrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
He's an asshole.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
Fire...
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Killing himself.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
That's stupid.
What assholes.
It looks a little like a swastika.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
What's it about?
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Lina, come here!
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I didn't realize you cared.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
How would you kill him?
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
He has Israel.
Those aren't Jews.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
What were you, following me?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Explain it so I can.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Think about your father. Your sister.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
It's German.
What part of Germany are you people from?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
Steve...
Tell it to Hitler.
I've got to get back to the --
You can heat them up and eat with him.
Number ten.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
Christ...
You said they didn't have night guards.
Why? Why would she?
So what do we do with the device?
Where?
I have an idea....
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Why me?
I can tell....
I was a Jew in a previous life.
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Obviously.
Just a little... What's the difference?
So what?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Eat shit....
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Johana, am I boring you?
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
No!
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Hello!
You know each other?
I think I'll have a coffee.
I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Have you known him long?
What was he like, when he was little?
Italy!
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
Enzo!
Checking out the competition.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
I won't, I swear.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Lira?
Six seconds.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
He's training.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
And... does the voice come back?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
People say that?
Forget it.  I was joking.
Well... about everything.
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
What?
Yes.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Thank you.
You say that because you have the title!
Well that's very nice of you.
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Lucky I was there to save you.
Why?
I'm still here.
It's me again.
You want to lie down for a while?
I saw how it has to be.
Positive, Sir.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
No.
He doesn't hear too well.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Again?
They're going to send detectives.
No.  I'm just depressed.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Yes... It's magic.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
He isn't going to breathe.
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
C'mon follow me.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Keep going.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Mazel Tov!
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
It's Friday.
Why not?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Nice fellow?
What about me?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Sure.
What do you want to see him for?
Where? Where did you find it?
All men are fools. They like to make a big show - shout and hunt --
Who?
What are you doing that for?
Go on -
At four. He will be there at four.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
I'll miss you too, honey --
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
I want to ask you something.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
That's right, of course.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage - eh?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard   Don't you?
It's better you don't know.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Then you found the leopard --
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
That was a calamity!
Thanks.
I thought they came right past here 
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
That's easy. Me.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
You're too good to me.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Clo-Clo?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
That doesn't make sense.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
What! You can't be --
We will 
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
You a tourist?
That might depend on where youre going.
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
When will they be back?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The 1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Paul Lamont...?
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
When did you get back?
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
No!
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Should I?
You seem to know what youre talking about.
To get me killed...?
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
What are you doing? You cant. I...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!
What do you suggest?
The dead can wait.
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Croissants. Like that...
You...  Jesus Christ!
By your Austrian?
I wouldnt mind. Thank you.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. Its all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what weve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen.
Emily...
Why?
What sort have you got?
Yes... Good, good...
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Tomorrow?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
And who does Friedman work for?
What company?
Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Whats the Ambassador?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
B-Black...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Its not.
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
I hope its not too significant.
Recommended?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Okay. Recommended...
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Any friends?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
Shut up and drive!
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.
Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
An Austrian.
You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - youre the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Hows the boy doing?
Fine...
I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
What about which girlfriend?
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
If you can, send me a receipt.
The acid bath?
What do you think, huh?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Are they still operative?
Mossad?
Whats that? A word?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Majesty, I can't...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
No, but...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
We have to press home the attack!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
No...
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I leave the answer to God.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Why?
To avoid killing anyone.
And when was that?
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Guess.
What about you?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
The English??
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
In a village called Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Last night.
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
... as always, majesty...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Let them come!  Let them see who's the true king of France!
Noooo!
Is it long and hanging down?
He's on the other side of the river.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Damn right!
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
No good?  This is a disaster!
Perfectly.
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Jeanne, look behind you.
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
I'd sooner die than use magic!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
My king.
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Why not?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
God asked you to do something?
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes, my lord.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Why did she have to die?
Who wants me to stop?
Yes.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Who are you?
Wladek, please.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I'll see you...soon.
He'll be back before curfew.
He'll be here soon.
Just over a year.
What are you doing?
I'll be fine.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
I haven't seen him.
Can you help?
It costs.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Who told you?
Who's recruiting?
Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
It certainly was.
That makes a change.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
That's better than yesterday.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
You're out, aren't you?
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Hungry.
You'll be deported.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
But I want to help, I want to.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
Bitch!
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
I am... I was a pianist.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
No, it was a table.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Baines is packing up?
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I miss you.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Yes
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Yes, I suppose you would.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Everyone has to practice.
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
It's my mother's piano.
A piano?
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
What's the line on Visitation?
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Here.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
I think it's the best...
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Shove off, Duff.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Which one?
Mottola.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
They're still looking for him.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
All he's gotta do is read.
You mean you blew it.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
Then you'll do it?
If we ever get to it.
Did he say he wouldn't?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Yeh.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
That's why he won't know it.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
The name is Lonnegan.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Yeh, sleepin'.
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
Yeh, this time anyway.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
What do you mean?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I'm in.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Oh, Jesus.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
For fifteen years.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Nothing.
You better take a drink.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.
What do you mean?
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Why don't you try him again?
I've got to see you alone!
She fell down.
I don't know.
She... she fell over backwards.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
He's been dead for three months.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Yes.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Not a thing.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We were looking for this bird.
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Who's your candidate?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
I think we're on the right track.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Nunheim!
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
This is enough for me.
Rosebreen.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
--was Wynant's.
Well, what?
About three.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Tell 'em.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
You've said that for weeks.
Chris!
I couldn't go near that woman.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
So I see.
I don't like him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Don't you remember....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I can't! I haven't got it!
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
I'm not telling anyone.
I trust you.
No.
Well, let me do that for you.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
You don't say --
I see.  I see.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
By the way, how is your father's side?
Much better, thanks.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
What are you going to do with it?
Good. I want to talk to you.
I'd like to see you work.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Yeah.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
You did.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
What's the matter with you?
Why don't you?
So am I.
Catch me letting you go alone!
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You bet I wouldn't.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Well, don't they?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
It's the only way it makes sense.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
It's a fortune box.
Wha...
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
For climbing.
Yeah.
Ready when you are.
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
What about it?
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Then get up and do something about it.
Get off him!
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
He...he could have been watching us.
You said he was a deserter.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
He's an enemy soldier.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
Get out of my way.
I out rank you, that's why.
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
I have to answer him.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
I did it!  I got the box open.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Oh, that's fun.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Millionaires, man.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
We leave it.
I got that...sir.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
Mine.  Land mine!
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
Epps...
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
They're going to kill us!
It looks like you're not doing anything.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
What?
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We'll find our way.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
We'll lie.
You still got a map on you?
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
And then what?
I don't have a weapon.
I don't know!
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
How do we do that?
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I don't know.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
He'll slow down.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
People are suffering.
I thought it would be good to know.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
That's in two days.
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
At-at-at-at-at.
Oh, no.
Oh, Jesus!
You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Don't be so sure.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
No one can see us now we're alone.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
THX and me.
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
But you can't...you.
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Too late....stay close.
Maternity ward, huhh!
What kind of answer is that?
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
No?
Look more closely.
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
You should know better than that!
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
-Where?
Thanks.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Go ahead.
You the Bomb Squad?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Right.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Why do you do it?
Be right back.
How do you know?
Would you?
Okay, let's go in.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
I don't know.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Easy, guys.  
Helluva fuck factor.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Taylor's dead.
Thank you.
I know. I warned them.
What? Nobody, I-
What about the ballistics report?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
Quiet!
What?
Huh?
IRA - instant retirement account.
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Goddamit, Reilly--
Yes, sir.
I promised her she'd be safe.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
No!
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
You've never been in Constantinople?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
The type they marry.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I thought so.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, Baron.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
You can trust me.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Two weeks and three days.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Otherwise I'll call the police
What do you mean?
I know it!
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
Monescu.
Good day, Doctor.
No, Captain, I tell you--
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Disappointed?
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Gaston!
Last year? It can't be that long.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry?
But it's not enough!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Spanish passports?
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doa Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
I remember.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
That sounds sensible. 
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Ye-es?
You're hired!
I'll be delighted.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Good night. 
Goodbye.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
I know all your tricks.
So you think you can get me?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
Please! 
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Yes, Gaston?
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
And you expect me to believe that?
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Jacques!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
I don't want your money!
He started it.
Then why did you do it?
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Well, where is it?
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
I was tired.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
No, but we're making excellent time.
We've struck ice.
Excuse me.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
I know what ice fishing is!
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
This is crazy.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
He couldn't have.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Get in the boat, Rose.
I can't feel my body.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
I should like to see my drawing.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
Sure!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I'll join you later.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Montana?
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
I'll say she is!
You've got lipstick all over you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Brett is the name.
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
Don't be a c-a-t.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?
Okay.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Don't let's talk about it.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
We'll let it go at that--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
What's the matter?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
You take some awful chances.
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
Thank you, sir. 
What is it?
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Get it!
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Think again--
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Swell!
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Why, I--
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
How?
How?
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Sure.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
So what?
Well, did you find me?
Who won?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
Yeah--
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
Meaning what?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
I'm getting seasick--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Well, he has a straw hat--
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Good-night, folks.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
What for?
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
Why don't you leave me alone?
You leave the kid alone.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Not a chance--I'm through. 
Good night!
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
I sincerely hope so--
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
I'll explain later--
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
Now Ed, are we cross?
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Nice voice.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Well... 'bye.
No...
Yeah, you look it.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Enough?  Never.
Better.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Ignore her?
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
That's great coming from you.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
You'd die for fun?
How would you know?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
'Least they don't scare women.
I know.  And nobody can make him.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Well I'm real scared.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Acquired?
I know, I need a keeper.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Yeah, and dangerous.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
I can feel your pain.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
- Instant melt-down.
What about the gold?
I appreciate your time -
Where can I find him?
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Come on. I know better than that -
Well... If you insist.
Not from forty feet.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Who knows? Fog, night...
That's reassuring.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
... Kids?
Thanks.  Take care -
You too.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Nice to run into you again.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No?
So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Blood or Dutch?
You are seriously deranged.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
No. I'm going with you.
... Yes?
And number two?
Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -
What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.
Sabotage?
I am. What do you want?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Yes -
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
You come with me -  You stay here.
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Who is it?
Maybe. Maybe not.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
You always got something to say.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Why in the h...
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Do you think you won?
It was nip and tuck.
I'm busy.
It is just a regular card.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
Good afternoon to you.
Hattie is a different person now.
You invited me.
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
My mother passed on years ago.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
I already have, my dear.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
Don't shout!
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
It is so considerate of you.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
But what if we leave them behind?
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Let's let Molly open one.
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
I'd better take a look anyway.
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yeah, right.
Yes Sir!
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
Look out!!
Not today!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
What?
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
You are a liar!
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
Okay, save your batteries!
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
He got it, Woody!
Sir!  No Sir!
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Sid!!!
Huh?
What?!
Right here, Woody!
No, Slink --
Got it.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
There's no mirror.
I did like the music.
I carried you up to your bed.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
What did I do wrong?
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Living with him put years on me.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
You did what?
In my pocket.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
So had I.
Storms?
We're too young.
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
I don't know what you mean.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Nine thousand dollars.
Why are you talking like that?
What is he being charged with?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
Carl, that's insane.
Carl --
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Barbara --
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
I don't know.
Hi.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
How long's the job?
Like I give a fuck.
Parents still together?
Not like.  It is.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Yes, mom --
Then here's a little bump.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Who do you work for?
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
No --
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
So you pay off our customs officials?
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
We aren't barbarians.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
Yeah.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Not this time.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
No.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
Javier Rodriguez.
What is the name of your informant?
It was an anonymous tip.
If I can.
A small thing.  Nothing really.
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
Any idea how much?
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
What?
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
What kind of research?
Well, why didn't you bring them?
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
You've stabbed me, man.
Ninteen.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
Can you not go yourself.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
I guess you would, Franco.
Diane.
What?
Come on.
Well, it isn't.
What? Steady like?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Aye.
Now remember --
Who wrote it?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
So who else?
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
God, you're sick.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
We're two thousand short.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Well, it's up to you.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
No, I don't think so.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Six weeks.
Six weeks and no sex?
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
You doubt me?
The ship....
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Position, Bird of Prey?
A Federation starship.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Let us explore it together.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
I've always known... I'll die alone.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Damn.  Let's go.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
I did not.
I gotta sit down.
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
I am here, Captain.
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Uh-uh.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
You are mad!
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?



Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
No. I will not.
Do you?
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Want one?
I know, I met him.
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Flynn had Group 7 access.
To warn him.
For being on to Dillinger.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
Cute.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
User requests are what computers are for.
Well, isn't it -- ?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Yeah, I... oops!
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Yes.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
Probably.
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
How 'bout yourself?
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
It grows on you.
Come here.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
You're getting out of the business?
Strategic Air Command.
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
Do it!
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
You seem fine now.
Fine.
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
You're kidding.
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Son of a bitch!
You want me to just hang-- ?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, but for who?							*
He could be working her to get to you.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
You know about that?
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I'll handle it.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
They must've just missed me.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
What did you need?
I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
My husband can't know about this.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
I'm not wearing any.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
It makes you tell the truth?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
What about Juno?
Did you pork her Harry?
Looks that way.
Harry... snap out of it!
As much as you used to?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
I'm sorry, I can't.
And you chased one?
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
You'll call me then?
I'm married!
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
His wife.
His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
What letter?
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
The letter he sent.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
'Bout twelve.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
What do you do?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
What are your turn-ons?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
That's a long time.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
This motherfucker sounds charming!
I don't believe so.
What?
... was so romantic.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
Yeah.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
You'd really do that?
No thanks.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Tell me.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot.
The zoo.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Yeah?
In case of what?
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
No problems on both counts.
They'll be along.
I guess so. Follow me.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Me too, Boris.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
She seems very nice.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Do tell. Why drug related?
I got some money I can give you -
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
They didn't tell me.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Absolutely.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
I believe he believes him.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
Not a tiny little vial -
Or a supporting actor -
He saw the wire.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
What can I do?
Just put it in your purse.
Read my lips.
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
So that...???
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
This is April, right?
What year is it?
No, 1995 is the past.
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
Jeffrey Mason?
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
I...I...We need cash, James.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
Not, "what", babe!  When!
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
How did you find me?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Christ!
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
That a fact?
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
That's my morning's pay.
Hundred and eight already.
I need a ticket.
Where in Mexico would you like--
He's up at the Look Out.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
What time is it now?
How much?
How much!?
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Two-hundred.
What?
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
Yeah, you better remember that.
I want my car.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
We ain't got no Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Yeah, I'll try.
It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Yes.  Yes it is.
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
John--
Who the hell is this!?
Wrong number.
They look nice.
When did you buy a gun?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
You love him?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Is it pretty?
Take me with you.
Jake.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I don't know.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
No.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Funny thing.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
But you said we could be together.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I'm here.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
No.  I swear it.
Someone will find me.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You've got to be--
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Live there?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
No.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
Isn't that illegal?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I do.
And what does that make you?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
You love her, but you hate her?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
SHUT UP!
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
Trouble with the car again?
Darrell giving you problems?
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Not from where I stand.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
How about I pick one out for you?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
What's your name anyway?
Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Not before I settle with you.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
I guess.
Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
I didn't do anything.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
And you're taking?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You want something, old man?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
That a fact?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
You afraid of the dark?
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
You know I won't be seeing you.
You expect me to believe that?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
You've got to be--
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
And tell her what?
It's the truth, Jake.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Harlin around?
You own this place?
So?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Great!
Time.
Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You believe that?
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
What sign?
You got the money?
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
I got it.
That's all right.  I got it.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens when you lose?
I guess it must.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
What?
Beautiful?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
I have an idea.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
I'm guessing no.
You could leave him.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
You'd never understand.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Anywhere?
You already have.
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
You could give me my gun back.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
My mother died in this canyon.
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Can you make it back up?
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Out of here.
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
What kind?
Heineken?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
No baby, you got it wrong.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
Is Noel in?
Oh.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
How old is Jeb?
What did I say?
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I'll keep it in my office room.
Oh.
Oh shit...
Oh.
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
It's finished. I won.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
Was it serious?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
I don't know what you're asking?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
That's not what I witnessed David.
What's he look like?
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
I won't make any noise.
Just one--
What things?
No Jeremy.
Two hundred and seventy.
I see.
You're lying.
Okay.
In the passenger car?
Did you get up from your seat?
How long have you been married?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
On a bench, across the street.
No?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
He said...
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
Nope.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
No?
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
What's your name?
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
What?
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
He's... he's dead.
Then... what?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
What for?
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
What business?
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
Yeah, he's in there.
He's in there.
Tell me right off if you see him.
Yeah.
First one I ever killed.
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
You better get on back, Miss.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Yeah?
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Well, I come back, didn't I?
What?
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
I don't like the question.
How many you killed, Kid?
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We'll bury him.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
An' if I spot 'em?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
What was the money for?
Who ?
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
They'll never stop.
A glass of water would be nice.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
You are a criminal.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Dig.
Can we stealth these guys?
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Maybe more.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
You know damn well, dead-man.
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
I work for Keyser Sate.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Did they charge him with anything?
Two hours, tops.
Someplace else, then.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Waste of time.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
I just want to hear your story.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Kobayashi.
This is totally irrelevant.
What happened?
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
But Keaton...
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
I never heard of him.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
He wanted me to live.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Because he was my friend.
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
You think he's..?
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
Immunity.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Gruber...
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
That's right.
Yes!
Tell us.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Just as you are, Sir...
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
I am seventy-four years old.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Objection.
Huh!
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Just now...
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
We just ...
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
There's nothing they can do to me.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
And you wrote that...
) I'm sorry ...?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
Nothing happened.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I had a witness disappear on me.
Ready, your Honor.
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
Listen to me, fella...
Are you done?
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Let me talk to Mickey.
How come you're calling me from...?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
I think I will.
And are they going to get it?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work.
That's what I am.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What is that to you...?
No...no...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
That's right.
The Doctors.
Read me what she said.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
How old is he?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
You don't have to do it for a living.
And you like it.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Someone dead.
No.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
It's not my line.
Yes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Nothing.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
She... went into the Bay.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Do you live here in the hotel?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
What about?
Why?
You're not far wrong.
Let me come in.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
It's a place to live, that's all.
I told you! Right here!
I want to know who you are.
Then will you for me?
I'll take care of you.
No? Then what?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Judy --
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
Yes. Yes, I do.
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Wherever you'd like...
Well, after all, it's "our place."
Too late. I've got my face on.
No, Ernie's is fine.
Can't you see?
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.
Take me away...
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Yes!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
I loved you, Madeleine.
Do you remember where you were?
At...
Where had you been before?
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
Wandering about.
My name is John Ferguson.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
Some people prefer it.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Why?
Where?
Have you been here before?
Long ago...
How do you know?
I know.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
I love you too... too late... too late...
Why?
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
What's tomorrow?
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
Oh!
That's following a train of thought.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
How?
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Do you know him well?
For what?
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Naturally.
What is it, a still life?
Oh?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
How?
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
How soon can it be altered?
Can we have it by tonight?
I need a drink.
What?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
Sorry Fish.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
You're an asshole.
Name one.
I don't have to...
You're pathetic.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell you do.
You're a loser.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
Why?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
So I didn't fucking do it!
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
Alright. Let's do it.
Watch the tone fella.
It has worked.
They won't figure it out.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
What happened? Oh my God...
Well, oh...
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
The groom?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's still working?
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Not tonight.
Left side.
What is her disposition?
Well, I didn't mean it.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Shut up.
Call 911.
Shut up.
I'm calling the police.
Go ahead.
Boyd...What have we done?
What you just said. Say it again.
Take care of business.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
You're sick.
It's my fucking opinion.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
I never heard that.
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
Not true.
New king.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
Take Mexico.
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
How about my Fatburger?
What?
Government cutbacks.
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.
I think so.
Photographer?
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
Well it's bad timing.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Who else?
He's a great chef.
Problems?
What kind of seats can we have?
Go down where?
I'll call them from the road.
I love you.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Well I do.
Yeah. Nesting.
Go have fun. Not too much.
No. Just like an hour or so.
What about the chairs?
Okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Well, can you come back inside?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Okay. Okay.
No.
Do you love me?
But...
What does that mean?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
The only proof is those bodies.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
So?
I don't hear it.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Did he try to kiss you?
That's what I'm thinking.
What song?
...embarrassing, shameful...
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We will.
So where to on the honeymoon?
That's our plan.
It was an accident!
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
You'd like me to kill them?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Then it's a respectable house.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
No.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Who is she?
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Then you won't forgive me?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
Good.
That's good land.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
He was asking for it.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
Leave him alone.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
I'll be ready.
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
She's left.
No.
How much do you want for him?
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
There's been an accident.
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
Yes!
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
No, I don't want to.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
I don't know.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
I'M WHAT?!
He hears...everything.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Do I get to see it or not?
This is supposed to be years away.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
Then fix it.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
I'm still working on it.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
She's beautiful, you know?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
This isn't a game, Parker!
Authority still makes me nervous.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
That, or living through him...
Thanks.
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?
You don't know?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
...twelve years.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
He's not fine.
...where?
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
What rig?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
Who would find out?
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...you want us to go to War...
What did Albania ever do to us?
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
The Hostages...?
In the yellow ribbon.
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
...uh huh...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
...Stanley Moss...
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
...they just hadn't thought it through...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
War's over, Pal. 
Fine. 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Never quit a winner.
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Could we have you in here, please...7
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
...how ya feeling, boy?
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
I have a question for you.
I'll play your silly game.
To preserve their Way of Life.
I have.
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
...Yes.
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
...uh ... No, that's...
The... 
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
...that's what it is.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
W...what?
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
President's speech.
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
Yeah...?
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Mmm.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
How's our friend?
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
You got a dime....?
I'm looking for a phone...
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
They look stupid.
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
Leopard Skin...
No, he's back in Nashville.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
Jim Belushi...?
Surest thing you know.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
Why a beret?
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Is today Laundry Day...?
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
You speak for me, son.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
I don't know anything!
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Yeah, right...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
What does that mean?
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Excuse me.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Break it.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
...how do you know? You wish...
Old values. Buy.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
He still likes you
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Jenkins!
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
A little?
Hi there Sarah
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Sell my soul?
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
YES!
It's only two hours away.
I'll come back all the time.
Of course you will.
No, he wouldn't.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
A ghost?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Then we both are.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Then why did you?
Do you really think so?
Mm-hmm.
Nope.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who's that?
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
And then you weren't there.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
Yeah.
No, I don't.
It's fine.
She never mentioned her father.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
We know each other.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
He was so pissed.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Absolutely.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
I don't...
The planchette?
Shhh.
Jody, she's alive.
Then what was it?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Please.
I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
All of us.
What are you going to do?
Like what?
Jody he was lying.
I think three...
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
It's Saturday.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
I am, really.
You are...
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
Shhh.
To make sure she's all right.
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
It's what I've been working for.
Is it gone?
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
In the house.  I was scared.
Did you call the police?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Did you tell her?
You didn't?
What?
A flare?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Dressed?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Five minutes?
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
We had a seance.
But then you've been so much better...
Claire, please...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
But I don't remember.
Not personally.
The...
Yes.  The ghost.
It's Madison Fra--
STOP IT!
Since when?
Claire--
So you fucked a student?!
Get out of my way.
She can't be here without me.
Mauduh...
:Would you stop it!
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
I had you sent away.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Eighty million doll --- ?
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
She didn't feel them
'He'...?
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
If you knew how I yearn for that...
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
I love Michael...
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Harder...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I'm glad you're around to say it.
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
You still feel that crazy...?
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
All I meant was -
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Let's see.
Hello..
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
A little wine...?
Did you see the old man on the ---
- we made a fire.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
I don't know.
A bit much.    Lucas.
What were you talking about...?
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
BRIAN...
That's right...
And it can't be forged?
All the time?
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
No she didn't...
What did you do with her?
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
then why did you marry her -
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Yes - I suppose so...
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I'm your landlady
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Check it out!
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Dead?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
You know...take the pictures?
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
I guess.
Yeah.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
You ordered a Winnebago?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Everything.
You mean they knew who I was?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
I understand.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Most places are, Jimmy.
Very funny.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Me?
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I guess.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
And then what?
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Like what?
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
Rules are rules.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
I have only one concern...
Tipping?
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Really? You'd do that for me?
Really? So I'm doing OK?
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
People pay good money for that?
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Kelly.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She still work there?
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
I'd like that.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You could tell me where you were last night.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Lombardo's settlement?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Unless what?
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
No.
Did he come in with you?
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
I wanna go home now.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
I said he did.
What?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
Lombardo ever come out here?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
You are.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
I'm not on your property!
Sam!  Hi!
I miss Dad.
No you don't.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
Why can't you come...
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
God, I've been calling you.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
That's not your line.
Forget it.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
What's that supposed to mean?
I just want my life back...
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
That's right.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
That's right.  That was his name.
Story's the same, Detective...
Yes.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
We?
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
No.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Funny.  So am I.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Wouldn't dream of it.
You need that real often?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Yes.  Now, observe....
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
Thank you.
It's better than nothing.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, thank you.
What?  President Grant is...!
There's only seventy-eight.
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
What is this?  A whole new train?
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Really?
I don't like to lose, either.
You tell me.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Would that include me?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
On my way to Denver...
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
He had a pressing engagement.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
It is?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Yes...?
Me?
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
No.  I mean yes.
I have no family.
He's no magician.
Why.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
Farmer.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You hear trouble.
Fresh goat's milk.
Where the hell did you come from?
I thought you had her!
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
Well what did she say?
Want me to carry Elora?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Absolutely not.
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
What's the magician's weapon?
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Somebody has to do it.
Me neither!
Who is he?
Here.  Hold her.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
They're Amish.
I thought I was the English.
It's been a while.
You don't say.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Sure have, Sam.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Johnny 
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
Move! Or you die right here!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
It's not a joke.
They kid a lot.
I would not be too sure.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
I'm going this morning.
But Stoltzfus said...
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
Oh. The bullets.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I know.
I was being foolish?
That's God's way!
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Make that 1790.
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Not yet.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I don't know where he is.
But... if you had to guess?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
No? Why not?
No...
Looks dead...
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
That is idle talk.
You shame yourself.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
No... No. It is just the English way.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
No --
No --
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
Oh ....
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
Oh, now?
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Why --
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
What's she doing now?
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oil can....
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Yes...!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Did they hurtcha?
Ohhh!
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
My, it's good to be....
Did I scare you?
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
They would?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Here -- here --
The other side....
Yes --- there.
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Dorothy next!
It did?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Here --   Come on.
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
Yeah.
Don't push!
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
Dorothy!
Yes.
Ho -- ho --ho
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Well, I --
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
Yes -- ....
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
So who are you?
Elektra would control it all.
But what if...
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Renard.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Your last chance. Take the money.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Im sorry.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
No.
Were alright.
I know.
...you should rest.
I dont want to be safe!
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
Not interested.
Soon shell be everywhere.
You turned Renard.
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
A rope!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Could...could you come?
I would like to use the bathroom --
What?!
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
You -- you know about me and Dan?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
Cured, yes.
No.  I just wanted you to --
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
She's with me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
The missing scientists.
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
What if youre wrong??
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Old?
What are you up to?
Okay!
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
That's because --
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
Coward.  Giving up.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
What caused it?
We should get back --  What?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I don't know their real names!
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Please.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
What is that ungodly smell?
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
What do I get out of it?
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
He gets to be the hero.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
We hung out last night, remember?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
They come in any other styles or colors?
That one I'm real familiar with.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Its core?
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you one thing though.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
You know, you --
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
He takes himself seriously.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
You mutant bastards...
Deal.
What did she do to me?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Yes, my dear, he is.
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
Now wait a minute!
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
I did, sir.
Yes, sir.
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
Baack!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Well... yes.
Yes, don't worry.
You're incorrigible!
Darling!
Why does he call you 'master'?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
I suppose you're right.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Yes, just the two.
There wolf!  There castle!
No.
The wockers with the knockers.
I wonder what's got into them?
What are you doing here?
What?
Must be the music room.
I have a pretty good idea.
I want that brain.
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
That's not bad.
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Who are you talking to?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
It wasn't me.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
There's only one way.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
It's the only way.
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
How nice.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Inga, wake up!
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
Stop -- singing!!!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
But, after all, you have yours.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
Yes.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
