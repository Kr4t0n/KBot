Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Forget it.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
That's a shame.
That's because it's such a nice one.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I believe we share an art instructor
Then that's all you had to say.
No...
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Let's go.
Who?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
What?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
So did you
Perm?
What if she never starts dating?
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
Why?
So they tell me...
Thirty-two.
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Why not?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
You wanna go out with him?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
That's what I just said
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Yeah -- we'll see.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Sure
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
Where?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Away.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Fine, thirty.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Does it matter?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Who?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I know a lot more than that

That's what you want, isn't it?
Why 're you doing this?
Sure, I do
Who?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
What?
Do what?
BIANCA
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Maybe.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Acting the way we do.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Then you screwed up
For. . . ?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
What?
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
What?
Is that right?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
With the teeth of your zipper?
See you next week!
Pirate -- no question.
Dr. Ruth?
Your daughters went to the prom.
That ' s what I thought
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
I am, Your Eminence
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I know.
Are we going to argue?
Thank God...
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I'm not bargaining!
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Look out of that window.
Chief says...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
So was Christ!
What are you saying?
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We don't need to know.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
You must be mad...!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Then why?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What's your cut?  How much?
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Can I see your back?
Yes, I considered it.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
End my career?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
A timer.
Any I.D.?
Stay with her.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
You're Polish?
Stay here.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
You wanna talk to her alone?
I'm serious here.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
What do you want?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
What's your accomplishment.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Alright.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Could be Leon's.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Answer it.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
I love you.
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Thank you.
I'm not moody.
Not what.  Who.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Okay.  You ready?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Two weeks.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Okay.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Shut up.
Don't want to film this?
I did.
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
No, I don't get that!
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Milos.  Get my money!
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
How did you start the fire this time?
Don't blow your nose!
How long they been livin' here?
What the hell happened?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
No. I never did, either.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
That seems very unlikely.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
You're kidding.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Yes, it is, Hal.
The antenna has to be replaced.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
How is gregor?
Well, that does sound very odd.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, very pleasant.
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Any clue as to what it is?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Roger.
Roger.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
How about chargin' the battery?
Vodka.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Sure, anything you want.
No way to start a partnership.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
You have a good time?
What are you talkin' about?
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
You gonna let me keep any of it?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
No class...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Why?
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
So do you...been a long day.
What?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
When? How?
That's the way I see it, too.
What's wrong with that?
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Jack, wait...
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
When?
You chickenshit punk...
Naw, right here's okay.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Napoleon... small.
The case was stolen?
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
I'm fucked!
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
I know...
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
It means, "Never without my permission".
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Do you love her?
I don't have time... I need to know.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Don't exist bud.
How do I look?
So, just how big was this fare?
Leeloo..
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Have you pulled yourself together?
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Crystal.
I don't think this is a good time...
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
I'm not going.
Why not?
Uh..you're welcome.
Cornelius..
What is... Make Love?
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
You get that off the screen?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I want to sleep... forever...
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Wonderful!
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Gentlemen?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
I'm not accusing you...
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
I don't know what to say
Don't...
Amy...
I just talked to her.
Snuff?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
What are you talking about?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
And they are?
If it's not him, there's no deal.
Machine's in?
They should be here any minute.
Sure.
What are you... ?
Take out your gun!
You betrayed us.
Call me Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Any good?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
What?
Who is this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
How'd you find me here?
What do you want?
I want his name.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Stop talking.
Show me where you buried her.
Easy enough for you.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
I was well compensated.
Shut up.
I'm asking.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Yeah... guess so.
Three, four years.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Specialty product.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he, his name?
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Thank you.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Okay, I follow you so far...
You told me to look, so I looked.
How are you?  Having any luck?
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I don't understand, who are... ?
Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
I don't know.
Yes.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
Of course.
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Her belongings?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
I can't find him.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Then you saw him, too?
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Kristen's story really got to her.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Don't worry, honey
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
You're not taking my baby!
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Been having bad dreams.
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
You're right.
To take a picture.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Alice...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
That's the only reason you're alive...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Well we gotta do something!
My baby!
Then we'll find another way.
Meaning?
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Who?
All of us.  Right?
Faint.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I can't listen to this.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
I'd sooner swim!
I don't know.
So they caught up with you, too?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
A lot of people think like that.
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Oh it does???
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
What about time...?
Under <u>water</u>?
What direction does the system indicate?
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Obviously.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
I'll be another!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
No. Black.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Twombley involved?
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Shit! What are we gonna do?
You can't buy Wade off.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You think so.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Hmm.
What happened?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
What blood?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I don't care. They're out.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
It's fun.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
Pop?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Huh?
You mean Twombley?
Something bugging you?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Could be.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Hi honey.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
For a while.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I'm sorry.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
What way?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
How's that?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
What?
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
You no-good pup!
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Everything you know is from me.
You and me.
Crawl!
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
What happened?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Want to know what I think happened?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Yeah.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Don't you even want to ask?
Back at The Fishbowl?
Jim... for godsake!
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Stay cool.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Yes, Mr. President.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Nine.
why did they do that?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
We're not going to make it.
Stand by.
A dubious distinction, no?
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
Scared. We're scared.
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Say something dear.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Jim...
Three...
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
That isn't necessary.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Both of you.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
We're handling it, sir.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Twenty-five years.
I just wish it was that simple.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Sir?
You better take this.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Let me by, Elaine.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Not now, Elaine.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
I mean for Ted.
Simon.
No, I've been excited before.
Roger.
Simon, what are you saying?!
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Go ahead.
Request; life support systems check.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Well...not for another two hours.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
He had fish.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
And a little ice!
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Hello.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Good-bye, darling.
What is it?
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Yeah...
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
I am George.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
And still it fits?
How the hell do you know that?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Did you talk to him?
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
To the... to the beach?
Thank you.
Nothing.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
You must leave me alone on this.
How potent?
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Fuck procedure.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Only holds five.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
Who else can I ask around here?
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Departmental policy.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Would you, Sir?
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Say again?  All after incinerators?
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
See you soon.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Bullshit!
Now, wait a second --
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
Alive?
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Sure, Hicks.
Poor bastard.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Stand back.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Uh, what's next?
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Just get back here!
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
It's readin' right.  Look!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Why not?
And hope to die?
You're really something, ace.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Did you ever have a baby?
Where is she?
You mean dead.
Can we dream?
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
What do you mean?
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
In a harem.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
I'll be right back.
No, she's fine.
I'm so relieved.
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
You have leave to try.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Why?
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
Oh, damn!
Wolfi.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
What?
Why not? Half the house!
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
It's killing me.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Then he didn't send you?
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Tonight?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
And I'm asking you -
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
When, may I ask?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Behold!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Who was your teacher?
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Majesty.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Really?
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
I think so, Sire, yes.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
What is it?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Ah! By all means.
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well. There it is.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
Is she not here?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Don't you have a maid?
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
This is just a game, Papa.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Where?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
So there you are. What do you say?
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Can I see it?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Really?
Mio caro Adone.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
Herr Sommer.
Of course not.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
But what is it they don't like?
How could I not?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
A Mass for the dead.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
This is only a vaudeville.
Are you ill?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
What man?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Would you? Actually, you could.
What?
Strange!
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Yes.
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Show me.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes!
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Do you believe it?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
The Emperor has given him permission.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, in the third act.
What do you mean - now?
Excuse me, my dear.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
How did he look?
Thank you.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Yes, Doctor.
What exactly did he call out?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
Yes, sir.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Warn him?
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
What shall we do?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
It was a wolf.
Yes?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Sorry.
Aw come on, Alex!
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Will you give me a break?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Now what do you want to talk about?
My best friend. My very best friend.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Yes, go on.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
That's easy enough.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
I would think so.
There is only one bed.
I was awake and he was in my room.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
I should be committed.
Pull over.
What?
I swear, I don't know this girl.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No.
No!
I looked.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
No. You've had your chance.
I was having a nightmare.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Right.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
She's a jerk.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
Look at that.
Come on, I'm freezing.
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
A coyote.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I don't know. Come on.
It's circling us.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Walk away, Jack.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
I can't stand it.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
What?!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Yes.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
What do you think?
Hi, David.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
Sorry, love.
No.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
And what, Sergeant?
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Yeah.
Charlie!
Yeah.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
And tell him not to delay.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Oh!
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Fifty thousand dollars!
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
I haven't got it.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
You don't have to do nothing.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
Cyril!
My apartment.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Let me see your cash book, will you?
I'm listening.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Yes, of course.
Happy now?
Numbers? No, never mind.
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes, thank you.
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I haven't any.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Well, I
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
Yes, sir.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
I'm afraid so.
Hardly.
All right.
Matt, come here!
Come here, honey!
The ten dollars.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Well . . . ?
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh, Charlie again.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
All right, dear.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Okay, Matt.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Jim Younger, I told you--
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
What have you done?
Swear.
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
It's tougher than it looks.
Oh no...
The Army can hang him.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
How?
What is wrong with you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Yeah.
I got three.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
A trap.
Pass me some whisky.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You ride like a Comanche.
Both would be nice.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
What?
Where is Jesse James?
The District Marshall
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
You're right, sir.
On account of we're robbing it.
So?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
It's fine by me, Jesse.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
So we got a plan?
Such as?
That would have made an impression.
I figure.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Hell of a war.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
Damn. All that reading paid off.
What do you think?
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
The posters?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
And we're good at it.
You've killed your fair share of men.
If I could go back to farming --
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Yeah, Jimmy?
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Can't argue that.
How much of that story is true?
Everything but the boring parts.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
You're sick of my company?
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Where will you find such a girl?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Me neither.
Let the law --
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
"Hmm" what?
If you don't see it, it's not real...
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
I'll explain on the way.
That's the idea.
Damn.
Was it worth it?
Fair enough.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
No.
You do that.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I just though you were awful cute.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
They had to be dealt with!
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I remember you.
This is no game.
In English, Pinkerton.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
On a lot of lithium?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Dorsia's nice.
You like it there, don't you?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
It's not that nice.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Is your Evian spiked?
He's good-looking.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
What exactly do you mean?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Ask me a question.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
I said we are totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
Negative. Cancel it.
You look nice today.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Forget it.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Jean-I'm not-
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
Well...
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
I know. I'm sorry.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Hang...out?
He had a yacht?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Actually, yes.
What?
No.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well, I could he wrong.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Not in the mood, I guess.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Yes.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
I'm hungry
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
What am I gonna do?
Al.
Shhhh...it's okay.
I've been great. And you?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
"Make" him?
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
...But?
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
Nothing.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
He wasn't acting?
Have a seat.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
What?
What?!
Wanna be a part of history?
Is it your dish?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
...Do I?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
I'm sure.
Were the flags for Teddy?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
You've been coming in early.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Longitude 109 --
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Those really weird, short lines.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
You're compulsive.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
I don't know --
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Oh.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
That's lame, isn't it?
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Bring it to the other location.
Uh. Not exactly.
Jesus, Teddy.
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
You may.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Or sometimes not at all.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Hungry.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Yes?
Be careful.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.
Yes, Basil?
Thanks.
Yes Basil?
Hey, Mick!
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
My wedding tackle.
My meat and two veg.
A Chigro?
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
He's too well-protected right now.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Oh, yes you are.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Of course, luv.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Indeed.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Shut up.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Yes.
Yes.  Scott!
Right.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Yeah. What?
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
How's Austin?
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
We don't judge here.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Seriously?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
... power ...
... love...
Fear ...
Peter ...
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
This isn't a game.
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
So am I.
Thanks, Valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
You're mad.
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
What are my choices?
I'll never marry you.
Whereas you are.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Or half cocked.
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Did he say who?
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Any ideas?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Orders.
Nothing personal.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Not for a moment.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
You lied.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
You'll find out.
You didn't tell her?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
You first.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
You're saying I have no choice.
Decontamination -- ?
How did you guess?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Insane ... ?
Why?
Guilty until proven innocent?
Stay by the window. By the window.
The last one you'll ever see.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Debbie's marrying Rick.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What do you mean?
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
No.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
The car for Debbie?
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Yes I did.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
I've tried to change her mind.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
It looks awful.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Oh... I got something for that.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I love you.
Why don't you get undressed.
Rick, you're lying!
Yeah.
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Great, Mom.
Any time, Al.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Your whores never showed up.
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
That's more like it.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I just want to be alone.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Ha, ha, ha.
It's Bullwinkle.
I'd love that.
The phone made me do it!
No, Brett, I...
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
I'm separated.
About what?
Oooooo.
I don't know.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
Who's your friend?
Who?
Debbie.
You got it.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
I don't know.
Be gentle.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
He's alive.
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Hey.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Brian, look --
Fuck you.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I'll handle it.
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Shut up!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
Yeah...
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
You think that's really any of your business?
Then why did you quit?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I'll see ya around, huh?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Trychticholorate.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I need another one, sir.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
See you Monday. Sir.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Pest control.
Glass?
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
What reason?
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Then who wrote the report?
How ya feeling?
Yeah.
Just wondering.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
It's in my blood, Willy.
Management were pin heads.
Well, let's have a look.
I'll be there.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Putty? On both doors?
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Didn't think you'd make it.
And the world -- the whole world.
-- Burn it all.
Investigator Rimgale.
It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Who?
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
I forgive you.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
I want 15 on the Mets.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
What case?
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Who are you revolting against?
Yeah, him.
What's your name?
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
I'm out.
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
De-la-croix.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
That can be done.
Did we get our bill yet?
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We're starving.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
You have to start getting into your character.
How you sound?
No costume.  No blackface.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
I'm sorry I'm late.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
The name of the show?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Yep, you guessed it.
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
We think so.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
Calm down, please.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
How did you end up here?
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
What point is that?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Which one is your brother?
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
I don't want to hear it.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Yeah.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
It looks delicious.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I'll be right over.
He said that?
I can't go all the way down south.
I just turned twenty.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Thank you.  And always smile.
You sing and dance?
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Not her, the one with the little...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
We should go out on a double date.
...no, she didn't...
...not that time...
...then what about...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Are you trying to rap to me?
You don't read, do you?
My people love me.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
And his baggage?
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
I'll match any man with the sword.
It must have been some other gate.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Have you had one?
Not one.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
As much as possible?
Yes!
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Hmm-mmmm.
What is to be done?
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
And he doesn't care about me?
Tender Hegenheim.
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Who?
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
I don't know!
Shut up, Mueller.
Shut up.  West's dead.
It's... too slow.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
I'm serious --
I didn't shoot West --
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
And the bodies?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Epilepsy.
What business?
Yeah.
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
West... he's dead.
We just want to check your pack --
Why?
Do I?
You're lying --
From up close or far away?
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
What happened to "degrees"?
Mr. Hardy?
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
I didn't do anything --
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
I didn't --
Tell me what I can do.
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
What about the confession?
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
Does Osborne agree?
The Senator...
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
What are you talking about?
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You and the Colonel go back.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Yes.
Move him.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
You made me look like an idiot --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I don't know.
But you will.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
What happened next?
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
They got their stories straight.
No.
Good, just making sure.
Isn't this how your story goes?
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Nah.
I should probably write that down.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
What are you talking about?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
The faggot speaks.
Poor fucker my ass...
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
But you didn't see it, right?
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
Wrong answer --
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
We're not going anywhere.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
Then it's unofficial.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
That's great.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Who is she? Where does she live?
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
That would explain the indigestion.
There's only one I want.
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
Why?
Fine, I will.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Don.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
So I've heard.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
I know.
Lucky girl.
I was dreaming.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Karl.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
I'm not scared.
Am I?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
Oh, so you know.
Son?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Like this.
The River!
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
Really.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Probably tonight.
I'm going with you.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
We rented a car.
Really! That's wonderful.
Of course.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Such as?
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
We'll stop then.
That's not a burn.
What are you doing here?
What?
Oh.  We are Russian.
And...
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
Oh nothing.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Do you believe in love?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Syevodnya
In the world.
In every sense. If at all possible.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
I don't have any money.
I said I don't have any.
Fine.
It's none of your business.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
He will come back.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Why not?
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Sometimes.
Sometimes neither.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
You...
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You are throwing me out.
You don't have to say anything
I wasn't saying anything.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Have you had any before?
No.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Laugh it up.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
It's alright.
No. I think I better just go.
Please. Why not?
Goodbye.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Tell me about it.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Thanks.
Cash.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
When? Now? Oh. No.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
I need ya help again.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Okay.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Well, that makes it easier.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Now wait...
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Stop what?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I CAN'T!
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
To freedom.
I ain't in a hurry.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Nothin'.
You can handle it.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
What I love.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Shit. Who hasn't?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
Like I told you.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Ain't gonna be moved?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
What's that chain around her for?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
I do.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Please don't tell my daddy.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah, I know.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Ronnie...
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Thought you had a man for that.
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Why?
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Saving your life.
Not a prayer.
Number five with a bullet.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I didn't know.
Hey, when in Rome --
Nick, we can't just --
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
What does Charlie mean?
All right, how's the new partner?
Where would you look for the mafia?
Why the hell not?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
I stole them.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Nick...
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
A resort city, Beppu.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Yes...
You met her.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
I'd like that.
Dope?
Yeah.
What...?  What if I say no?
Why me?
He was my partner.
You're foreigners.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
You had my help, detective.
I don't have to.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Come here.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Well, actually
Like what?
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
This afternoon.
He's not ready yet.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Why, yes, of course.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
How do I stop one?
Okay, but...
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Sorry, don't have the time.
Prosit.
One more, eh?
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
I'm doing okay.
Money?
I'm taking a piss.
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Huh huh.
Nope.
What if you change your mind?
Too old.
But if you could?
Yes?
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
Does it eat?
Sorry.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
And who do I go to about you?
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
I'd never get an abortion.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
I work alone.
Yeah.
What do you want me to do?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
You did?
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Me and my dad.
Dead.
Oh.
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
No, I don't.
What difference will it make?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Please.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
How do you know I'm not?
Same thing.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Thanks.
You like it?
Your mom was a dancer?
Yes, ma'am.
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
And that's it?
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
No.
Thank-Q!
My Mom and Dad.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Because I want to get married.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
The big one!
It does?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Of course.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
No it's not!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Look unimpressed.
Yes!
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I'm sorry.
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Really?  Okay!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I've got to go, now.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Your mom made that all by herself.
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Yes, father?! Yes?
I'll try.
Uh-huh.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Uh-huh.
Not particularly.
Really?  Since when?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Yes. He likes windows.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
I LOVE THIS!!
Oh. I see.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Thirty-five.
The sky!!!
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
How do you do, ma'am.
Good!
Really? No kidding?
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Sorry, Mom!
I'll be all right.
Yes, ma'am.
Are you in trouble, son?!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Yes.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Yeah.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
It's safe.
No.
All our friends...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Coming!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Yes...
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Excuse me.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
--and we will--
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
I knew you'd like him.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Well, that's blunt!
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
No.
Uh..he might of.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He didn't leave with them.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
Coward!
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Where?!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
It must be great.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Yeah. I get it.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Nobody.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
What?
No. What is happening?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
OK.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Don? Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
I sure don't hate you.
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I did. Are you?
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
It's okay. It's okay.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Don? Where is he?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Hello, daddy.
Mommy's here.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Well. Okay.
Alright.
Yeah, I know.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Yeah. okay.
Yeah.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Terrible boring.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Why not?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.
He got a little jealous.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
That's what I thought.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
Okay. Great!
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Frank!!!
Dorothy Vallens?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. No. Why?
Sandy?
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Yes mother.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What are you saying?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Our mother can see through bags.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Okay. We're ready.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
Just like on TV.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Rule of thumb?
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
How do you figure?
Where's my cat?
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Pee...Per...Man.
Really want to know?
The what man?
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
And the pennies?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
What?
Sweet-n-low!
Witness?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey Murph.
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
What the fuck do you mean?
Yes.
I guess not.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
Yes.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Forgive me father.
Yes.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Open it!
The... The funny man.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Don't even say it, man.
Because my mom gets the bill.
I keep it for emergencies.
What about them?
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll say it.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No. We didn't.
No kidding.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
We said 48 hours.
Where was I?
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
We've got sixteen dollars.
I know.
Where's the rest?
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
What is it?
I'm sorry, Bob.
OK. Mark that down.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Yes. I do.
Take your second position.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
He did?
We're not sure.
What do you mean?
Behind Bob's house.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
No. Bob did.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Nobody does.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
You think I'm improving?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Jesus Christ! No.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Cuba.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Yeah.
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
True.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
They are.
Yes. I did.
I'll just drive my car.
Good question.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
OK.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
He electrocuted someone?
That's too bad.
No. I was calm.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
He wouldn't move.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
That could be anybody's.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
This could be a trap.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Yeah. It is.
Bob, you're lying!
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Now!
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'm trying.
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
He's damn good.
Who? Applejack?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Can't get it. It won't... 
Where's that guy going?
You got that?
What?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No, it's not.
There was a mistake.
That's not gonna fly.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Had to be done.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Okay... 
Felt a little light.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know who that is.
Conklin up front.
-- it hasn't been two years --
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
It's just a nightmare.
But it ends up the same.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Switch! You drive!
-- where? -
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Where are you going?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There's no choice.
Tell me later.
It might have.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
A Russian?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
You never worked Berlin...
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
What's that?
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Are you an expert in amnesia?
If you say so.
Some women like Dobermans --
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
And why is that?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
I don't want to leave.
We must sue for peace.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
The Scots will fight for us?
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
Scotland. He intends --
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
You mock us with a smile?
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Fourteen? --
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
I will not.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Humbly, M'lord.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
You are. And I'll come again.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
It does me good to see you.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
But you must have something to go on?
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
I don't know. These things take time.
Fix?
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Yes.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Where are my goddamn books?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
What?
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Fuck off, frat boy.
I'm sorry.
Duck, here they come.
Not if you remember my dad.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Those are your clothes, silly.
I dunno.  Just being weird.
You'll see.
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Ha! Where's that?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Oh? There's proof now?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Stop! Take me back!
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
We'll find out soon enough.
Evan Treborn.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Wow... read something.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Does he know that?
Oh, yes.
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
You want my advice?
Well?
Thank you, but I hardly think --
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
It's not for sale.
It's not for sale at any price.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we do.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
And the carrying charges?
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
Yes, something.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Uh huh.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I don't know the finish yet.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
It doesn't matter.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
The stairs from the street.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
And Laszlo?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Because you're getting on that plane.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Be careful.
I will, don't worry.
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
How do you do?
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
I beg your pardon?
Thank you.
Yes, rather.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Yes.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
-- Thank you.
Yes.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Even in Berlin.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Perhaps not.
Victor Laszlo?
Oh, but I just told you. --
This is the end of the chase.
Okay.
He is traveling with a lady.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
The winning side would have paid you much better.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Sam's piano.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I think perhaps you're right.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Put that phone down!
No.
I like it fine here.
He'll double what I pay you.
Sorry.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
You ever going to bed?
No.
Good. Then have a drink.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Yeah, boss?
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
No.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Shut up.
Then we've just got shit.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Oh?  You've tried?
You?  Personally?
I had it on the island with me.
So do I.
Cold.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
Not if you work for FedEx.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
For when I travel?
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
I would never --
If I'd known you were alive --
I would have done the same thing.
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
What was inside?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
Anything else?
Which I didn't have.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Yeah.
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
The place is falling apart.
I'm doing fine.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
Time I had lots of.
To life.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
What?
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
I need to do it.
No sweat.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Dr. Homer Wells.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I'm sorry, Homer.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Oh...
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I understand.
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Okay...
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
People watched the movies in their cars?
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
At least you were never lonely.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
Well, we have to help her!
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Nothing.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
He's *paralyzed*!
"...did." Well, okay.
I can't go nowhere.
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
That's true.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
He's leaving...
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
She looks after other people's children.
No. She was an immigrant.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Is that soon?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
It's okay--I don't mind.
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Actually, I volunteered.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Right.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Where'd she get you?
Yes, for both.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
I don't need your gratitude.
We heard that one already, Homer.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
Sorry, Homer...
What view?
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
Silicon Valley?
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
There'll be red flags.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
It's not true.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
But you won't get that splatter effect.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
You sure?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
What?
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
It's more than that.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
WHAT?
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Your mess.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
You sure?
Where the hell is she?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Escorts!
Do you have a ticket?
What was it?
You going to have the time?
I'll find the time.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
That was fucking deep.
Keep it up.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
In over your head?
I can handle it.
So what do you want?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
A Fed? Is he close?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
Let's just say he burned me once.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Why did you quit?
Sorry.
Eight-fifty.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
I'm working on that soccer story.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Not entirely.
You mean I won't resist them.
Turn around.
I've got something to tell you.
How did you land that?
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I don't know.
I'll see you in my dreams.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
You were talking in your sleep.
Gambling's not about money.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Nothing about you.
Leave me alone, Marion.
You're already alone.
I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.
How can anyone be that naive?
No.
Impossible to calculate.
So why did you come to my casino?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Near the casino.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
I can't do it, Jani.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
Yes.
I've still got mine.
How are you?
Did you solve your problems?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Thanks.
She's my baby.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm not going to report it.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
And the girls?
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
I'll tell you later.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
Has he?
I was at Beadles.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
Why four? And not three or five?
Where's the magnet?
I don't think so.
Wipe your hands.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
Good call.
I don't gamble.
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
That hair will have to go.
Fine.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Bruised.
What flickering light?
Oh. What's wrong now?
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Look, bomb...
I think he's talking to it.
Oh, God...
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Well, there's the possibility of...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
That is correct.
Of course not.
Yes, well...
Any planets?
Any of 'em any good?
Wha?
Ah, negative drop.
Oh, sure.
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Yeah?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
This.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
No.
Could you give us a moment.
No way.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Am I?
I got overhead...
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Look, I'd really like to...
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
What else can we do?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Thank God.
Logan Cale.
The one you're wearing?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Girlfriend?
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
It was open.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
That would be appropriate, yes.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
You lost me.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
I already don't like the sound of this.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Somebody's got to.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Well, not me personally.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Oh?
You did.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
You and me both.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Straight.
You know what I'm saying.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
I have sincere eyes.
You're the best, Maxie.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Tell everybody hey.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
I'm the victim here.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
A toy?
And why should she?
--a philandering pig.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
She was the one--
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Gin.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
Whatever... stella.
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
Check!
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Curly.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
It's my Bullworker.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
They're what?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Check.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
But, mom!
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
What?!
No...
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
What do you want?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
A metal craft of any kind.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Not until like... eighth grade.
What did you say?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have a request?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off. I want to see you.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Hey...
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Wonder where we'll be then.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Who?
What do you mean?
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Where is she?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Why? Is this about the book?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Don't you watch the news?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
Four times... so far.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
I know.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
I... I was playing with fire.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
If God exists?
I think now that he might...
Why?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
When will this happen?
Goodbye, Donald.
Yeah.
What's her name?
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Come again?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
You're not a bitch.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
But now you can't go.
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
She's alive, sweetie.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh God, I'm dead...
Yeah, you betcha...
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
We was robbed.
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Yes...
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Then it must be Wednesday.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
Bye.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
So? Be real easy.
They told me to practice.
My dress'll reek.
That's right.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
What?
The important thing is that we have a winner...
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
That's enough!
Nothin' too showy!
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Yeah.
Uh, Gladys?
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
Close up shop!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
The king can do to wrong! 
"My dear President"...
"My President"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
His Excellency's car!
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
But you're my father -
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
Take a letter...
What's the matter with you?
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
What do you whistle?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Did you shoot the rapids?
No, but I shot some ducks.
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
'At's-a fine.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
What did you say to her?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Anything else? 
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
I don't remember.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Why -- why -- of course.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Two, please.
I've always thought that myself.
I'll join you shortly.
No, I think a whiskey.
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Well, these things take time.
And here are my mother and father.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Like this. 
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Never mind that, I want my man!
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Yes sir.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Well, yes.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Won't be a moment.
Oh, yes.
Good morning.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Where did you get this box?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Yes!
Hello...
My name is...
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Thank you very much.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Ohhh...
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Oh yes.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Your mother?
Good morning.
...Can you cure me?
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Yes. John wants it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
You're losing your temper!
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
I've never LOVED anybody!
I'll bring it back.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
I see the world.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Yes... oh, yes...
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
The important thing is not to panic.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
Aaagh! Rape!
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
I met this girl...
So? What'd you do to her?
Look out!
But you're the Gods!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Like fish.
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
But...
How about making friends?
The Dragon...
Well, where is he then?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Mum! Dad!
Got you!
Hang on...
What have you got there?
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Help!
You'll drown us bo...
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did your father...
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
And something to sharpen them with?
No, Mother.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Yeah.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
No one.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Okay, I guess.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Rockville Center.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm Joel.
Probably see you at the book store.
It's okay.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Yeah.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Um --
It's pretty.
You pick it.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
I think about that.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
No.
That's scary sounding.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
You should stay.
Okay.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I don't think we're ready.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Joel, you're a liar.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
I'm right here.
What?
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Do you remember what we talked about?
We did talk about Naomi.
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
Is that what you want?
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Yeah, like that.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
I love her.
Seems too coincidental that way.
What are you doing?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
Tomorrow?
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Hi.
It's too late.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Well... I did.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
I hope you get your work done.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
We'll speak soon.
Nah, I don't know.
Yeah. Cool.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Happy. Happy with a secret.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Alexander Pope?
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
That's fine, Stan.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Yeah.
She likes you okay.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Jesus, Patrick!
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Clockworks?
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
I'm staying with the Countess.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
About...
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Like what?
What guy?
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
I'm the best.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Your ranch?
I heard it.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
I'll be all over it.
Hold on, Coop...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Please... kill...
Nothing. It's nothing.
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
He's crashing...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Thank you.
The dark inside me.
How do you know all this?
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
There's no one here, Skipper.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Alive?
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
It's complicated...
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
If it worked.
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
I don't know...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
What makes you think I'll miss?
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Now what?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Get out of there now!
We're all here.
But you can breathe it.
Oxygen is not the problem.
What about the life readings you picked up?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
No. It was someone else.
I know that.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
What's going on in there, Starck?
Justin's in the airlock.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one here.
Can you shut it down?
It's cold.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
She's not ugly.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Explosive decompression.
Do they have pressure?
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
I can't believe we built this.
I'm alright. Please.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
And you can? Power it up?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Solid.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Go back to the drawing board.
And they're changing into...
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
So are you!
I though we went over this.
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Now.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Sweet.
Blockhead started it!
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
That's good. That's uh... good.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Passion.
If it happened to him, then it could...
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Excuse me?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
I gave him twenty.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Reed, we're running out of time.
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Oh, I think you already have.
You want to work at Carl's?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
Manager!!
Sis.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I don't know.
I know what I look like.
Well...
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
I know it's yours.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
She's in my biology class.
No.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
I'm really pretty busy...
No Damone. I don't understand.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
How often do you go?
I don't go at all.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
Believe it.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What's the big deal?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
Climax together.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
What's Doug do in Chicago?
No.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
I paid for it and everything.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Sometime?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
All right! Oh, yeah!
How about your phone number?
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Naw. I don't mind.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Sure.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
I'd like that.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
A major!
Naw! Not a major.
This is my granddaughter...
Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
What for?
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Whatever's right.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Lucy is looking for you.
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Do you think you can handle it?
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Never missed a plane yet.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
I fear nothing.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
That's a strange attitude.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Yeah.
Nah, I got the gun.
Anyone.
OPEN THE DOOR!
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
No. You?
What?
He's dead.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your brother, huh?
We gotta try.
What?
But not flush against the tunnel?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Sure.
How much you got?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He shot you the other time.
What's going on between you two?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
I'm sure.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
She's not very nice, is she?
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Wait God-dammit!
Not without you!!!
Oh...
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
My clothes?
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
You know what I mean.
I'm not!
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Frances.
He's not here.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Right now we have to be practical.
GET OUT!
Claire?
...Yes.
Without me.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
You want his name?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
All square, Doc.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Thank you, Harry.
You really want to go?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
...Not if I can help it.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Kaminski.
What?
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Yeah.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Forget it.
The hell you will, Harry York.
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
I know.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
You're coming.
Who said I was a lady?
Whattaya think you're in now?
Huh?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
What's that?
Will you marry me?
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Why do you say that?
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
I live here.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
You think I got it?
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Go on...
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
I'll be back.
Sure.
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
I don't believe so.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Oh for Christ's...
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
You what?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
How did you find me?
Kill me and have done with it.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Your crime... as well as mine.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
She's not for you.
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
It's been months. It's not like him.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
Fine.
Nothing can. Not ever.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I'm all right. I'm safe,
So do I.
Why the change? What about your work?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Very well then.
Quite a few.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
I resent God's monopoly.
No. He had more important work.
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
How much longer?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Thank you, Henry.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
Let it go.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Why?
I'm... dying.
Are you a physician?
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Your men are right to be afraid.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Madness?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
Un-hunh.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Somebody'll see.
A short somewhere.
Dancer.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
Good call.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Rocky Road.
One night on the town.
Why not?
Yeah.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Thank you, son.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
On the dresser.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
You're a preacher?
Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I didn't.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
What are you going to do?
Forever together.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
In other words, no.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
That happens, you'll get it back.
Mexico.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
What you said to me in the room.
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
-- you got your sink --
I would say that's a very safe assumption.
Not even for lunch?
Knock yourself out.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
He didn't recognize shit.
No.
Feels good.
What?
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Or what?
I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
It don't look together.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
He needs our help!
No problem, lieutenant.
Just some of the women.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Thank you, sir.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
Across the board, sir.
West?
Smoke her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Fuck me.
Did you hear?
California.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Yes, dear.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Absolutely not.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
You'll think about my offer?
No, ma'am.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Do that.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Sir?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
So dump on me.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
I'd sure like to know who.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Well, now I feel so much better.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Thanks, Wick.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
That's a good story.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
You got anybody, Wick?
Not me.  You?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
Smoke it!
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
MOVE!
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
What?
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
We know, Audrey.
You made a mistake.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
The JFK? In the rain!?
You must have quite some harem.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
Most people don't.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
I can't.
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
I'll try.
That is when we will go in.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
And how should we do that, Sir?
That is our job.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
You're standing on it.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Why are you telling this to me?
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
You were right.
How do I do that?
Well good, that's very... nice.
Just don't.
Right... Sorry, sir.
Open.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
"The show must go on."
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
"Just!?"
Like YOU know?
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Nothing.
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Alex? Where are you going?
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Okay, now. But-
Wait two seconds then go.
Lt. Madison, GO.
That's It?
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Never mind, Fred....
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
It's ... incredible.
Something BAD happened here.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
It's... I don't know.
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
We're doing episode 31?
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
What the hell are you talking about?
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Stop, please! I don't know!
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
We pretend...
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
NO, Thank God he has not.
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
Wh... Where are we?
What kind of signal?
Tommy, we have these...
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Pedal to the metal...
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Over three hundred miles.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Is that a fact.
That can't be.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
A lot of years have gone by.
That you would have known you can trust me.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
No.  I guess.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
Then use rocks!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
We better, Congress invented him.
No one knows...
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
What's the difference?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I understand, George.
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
You must be very rich.
These supplies...?
I rode here, on my horse.
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
Get these men back in line!
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
I'm very aware of that.
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Yessir!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
You know very well who it is that I love.
But not more than your comfort.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Africa, of course.
It's stupid, of course.
Just because they are born?
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Come here, Farrah...
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
We'll get it later.
I have to ask you for that key.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
About sixty.
Your who?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.
Get something going there.
Who?
I don't believe this.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
In the can. That the money?
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Bear, you're not really gonna -
It's a different kind of deal.
I'm working on a few things.
You serious?
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
That's the magic number.
Who is this?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Never heard of him.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Ray. Look at me.
I like it here.
He owes me money.
I don't like waiting.
You're an investor, is that it?
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
What've you got?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I know what a marker is.
I want you to.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You mean, Leo?
Maybe a few times I have.
Really? You ever been arrested?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
I had to tell 'em something.
His shrink's trainer.
You have it?
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Personally?
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Twenty seven hundred.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
One of mine?
One we're producing.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Like this?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
That's not bad.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Who told you that?
How'd you know I was here?
How? By taking my money?
It's all mine.
I'll find you, Leo...
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Right. See how your story ends.
I just caught the end.
What do you think?
Not yet.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Really.
You thought I was faking?
I don't know.
You bet.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
I'm going into the movie business.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Come on in.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
How honorable of you.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Harry -
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
'We?'
Chili and me.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Really.
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Morning, skipper.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Why not.
What?
Maureen?
I like my job.
So we kill him?
A what?
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Right.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
I bet you did.
You're a pal.
Because of the gold.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
It's my pen name.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
You're more practical than superstitious.
There's somebody else on this boat.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
What?
The same day she supposedly went down.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Couldn't sleep.
The what?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
What's that supposed to mean?
Right here.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Yeah.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
You don't remember?
You've been out for about a day.
Say what?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
A what?
Fine with me.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
How should I know?
Who?
God, how horrifying.
Nothing.
Are you going to yell at me?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
You can count on me, sir!
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Hi.
Can I come in?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Yeah, well --
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
What?
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
What? Why?
How perfect.
Why?
We should follow them!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
You loser!
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
Fuck you!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
She says she wants to MMPH!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
We should follow him home.
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Let's go hassle Josh.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
I didn't get it either.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I know a party we could go to...
No way... when?
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
No, really...
God, you're really obsessed...
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
He came into work.
Nothing.
When was this?
Great...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
I did too!
Hey, where are you going?
Indian records?
Okay.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Watch my stuff.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
Yeah, well...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
Well are --
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
I - I'd really rather not...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
For nineteen years...
Hey, can I borrow this?
That's the spirit!
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Hi, it's me...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Well when can we do something?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
And you like them?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I had to see you.
What's the matter?
Jesus, how can you stand her?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I wish I could see him.
Call me sometime.
Talk to us about it...
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Do you have a check for me?
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
I think it's been a pleasure.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Don't they, though?
Starling?
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Shhh.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
John, it will not be easy.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
You mean nobody died?
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
I can try.
Only in life... 
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I'll have to.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Good news?
Do you love her?
Not even close.  What happened?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
We don't have a relationship.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
How is he these days?
Does he ever mention me?
Thank you.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
That's exactly what you said last week.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
We definitely had a moment or two.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Now you're talking.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Ghostbusters.
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
I know.
Then why have you come?
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Who are they?
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
I don't even want to know where that is.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Good idea.
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
I'll get one more reading.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
She's new in town.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
Hi, Louis.
Are you sick, Louis?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
That's a violin concerto.
Thanks.  What's in there?
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
Well, let's check it out.
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
All right.  What do you want to do?
Out!
I want to help you.
You heard it?
Who's the stiff?
Can't you tell me now?
You must have gotten the last copy.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
I've got to go now.
Take me now.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Whoa!! Nice voice.
Really!  Is it gone?
But why?  The students love us!
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
What is it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Thank you.
Has this ever happened before?
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Are you Peter Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
You could say that.
I'm not at liberty to say.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Yes, it would.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
See!  They are using drugs.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Wow!
What on earth gave you that idea?
Don't cross the beams.
What is it?
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
You talked to Gozer?
But it's my favorite state.
I blame myself.
Neutronize.  System shut.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Looked at with your eyes.
Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
No sense worrying about it now.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
I don't think it's Shandor.
Look!
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
LATER, MAN!!
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
That's difficult to say, general.
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Caesar?
We have to stop the Germans now!
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Yes, Caesar.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I'll nose around...
God of passages and changes?
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
My troops don't make policy.
Well, they die for it!
I was summoned.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
No!
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
I don't want you to die!
You teach them!
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Yes.
Are you going to graduate school?
No.
I don't know.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No, I couldn't.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
With a family?
Benjamin -- I really do.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Here he comes.
What?
I don't understand --
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
Oh.
I don't know.
Will you kiss me!
I have to go back now.
You really will?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Shhhh.
No.
Thank you.
I certainly hope you --
Are you listening?
Yes, I will.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
Who screamed?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
I am going to call the police now.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Right.
I'll be there in an hour.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Where is it?
Of course.
Let's go.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
But it's light in there now.
Please.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
No.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know that?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Like what?
Well I don't know.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
So?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
It's all right.
Sit down.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Yes?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Yes, I have --
What if he did?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Where is it?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
I've got to go.
Of course.
I'll be up in five minutes.
The number.
What?
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Benjamin.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Why don't you watch?
This is all terribly wrong.
Are you afraid of me?
Are you kidding?
That you're afraid --
If you want.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Oh my God.
Oh.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I got up.
I walk out.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We don't.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Is it?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Are you shocked?
Not particularly.
Yes.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
We'd go to his car.
That's enough.
No.
Let's drop it.
Now don't start this.
Of course you did.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Thank you.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Then you'd better start believing me.
Go home now.
Where is Elaine?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I don't think so.
Goodnight, sir.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
What?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
Goodnight.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
We haven't.
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
To be what?
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Ben, can I say something to you?
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
I'd like to hear it.
Oh yes.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
HUH?
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Yes, I can.
I don't believe it.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Splendid!
Not now.
Yes.
No.
I don't like your tone.
With the pearls?
Have you seen it?
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Aren't you?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Of course.
Sorry.
Money.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh!
Because you love me -- you love me?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
And...?
Go away. Who are you --?
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
Oh -- 
I know.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Yes -- yes -- yes.
I'll go -- good-bye.
When are you leaving Berlin?
For Vienna?
Why later?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Till then.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Then you know him?
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
If we could scare up some men to play.
I've no luck.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
How's the beautiful lady?
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
I don't know.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Anyone asked for me?
Oh!
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
No.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, don't go.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
You're trembling.
Really?
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Preysing?
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Money!
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Later?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover...
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Me.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Skiing? 
Perhaps. 
With the same friend?
What?
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Well -- you want me?
I must go to England -- at once.
A thousand marks -- 
Insolent young cub!
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Shhh -- here he is now.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Take them back, Suzette.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Please.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
No news yet?
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
Your what?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
You'll never shit right again.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
You're a thousand percent right!
You know it, Lilly.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
So here we are!
Can't move.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
You know who I work for.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
I'll get you a check.
It's not your fault.
Hello.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
No?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Well...
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
They twisted my arm.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Sure.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
I pay my debts.
You must have some money.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Not very good!
Uh-huh.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
No.
That's right.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
A future. The only future I've got.
What?
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Scram. Go home.
Are you sure?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
You called the doctor, huh?
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
I'll see you when you get home.
Because it's comfortable.
You ain't seen nothin.
See you soon.
You already went back to work.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Is that right?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
Open your door.
Oh, come here.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
Not many.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
No blood on the knife.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Only the real stiffs.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No.  Wait for the police.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Nothing's missing?
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
I know.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
I was trying to get away from someone.
Yes.
No.
I'm not leaving without her.
What?  Where is she?
John...
That would work.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
I borrowed it.
I can't afford to get caught.
I can see that.  Why?
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
I'm okay.
Okay... thank you.
Bye Will.
He's my brother.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
I have to pee.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Thanks!
Where's Shane?
Have enough fun for the both of us.
He's in the bathroom.
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
Guess so ...
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
But I've seen him!
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
I promise.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
Wait a minute ...
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
No one.
I dunno, boy.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Home is important to a man.
I suppose.
Must have changed that law.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't tell you everything.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Go home!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
You know what gets me?
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
Months?
I'm lonesome already.
Haven't got one.
Let's talk about something else.
First Nagasaki--now this.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
I dunno.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
You actually sold insurance!
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
You invited me.
You're hollow, like a woman.
You're my buddy.
Out!
Hello.
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Dr. Woodly.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He worships Father.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
College!
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Go on.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Penelope!
Penelope!
Damn.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Who was it?
It's Mom.
That's a rifle you have?
Open the bolt!
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
I'm talking to you gently now.
Heaven.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I'm engaged.
You don't even know me.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
We all are.
I did?
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I have a brain.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
People don't use that word any more.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
What then?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
Fish can't feel.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
The doctor.
I don't think so.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
I came for Paul as well.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Hope.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
If he thinks he's man enough.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I plan to live one hundred years!
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
None.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
We have, have we?
There's a certain amount of information there.
He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
You haven't heard me yet.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
And terror, if you don't mind.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
I'm an honorable clown?
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
I see.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
If you want to be found that way.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Leave the rifle here.
Jesus.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Who's dead?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Yes.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Ja?
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
Something's made you sore.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What's this?
Don't!
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
I know.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
That's an interesting piece of news.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Not true.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
No.
Okay.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Good night.
Far as I know.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
How long has this been going on?
You were wonderful.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
It's suicide!
He's not your son.
That's been said before.
We met here earlier this evening.
Thanks.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Or get eaten alive.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Penelope!  We're late!
He died of a massive rupture.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Yes, we do.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
No.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
You mean I'm black?
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Do you want to take a session?
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You want a tip?
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Yeah, yeah...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
If you say so.
The other girl is the star?
You making a feature?
You know her?
Do you know where she would be?
Tod might know.
How much do you make a week, Niki?
Three hundred?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Up front?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I am.
Huh?
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
A friend.
No.
Not very.
Tijuana.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
What the crap?
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
I can stop if you want.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
What makes you so sure?
Where is he?
I can't tell you that.
Where is he, Niki?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
...What do you have to offer?
That's right.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
I've got a meeting...
That's like a stag film.
They're legal now.
I don't know.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Like what?
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
What plan?
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where does he hang out?
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What you got in mind?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's a short film.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
No.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
What's that?
I'm worried about Jake.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Who's that?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
At least I improved myself. What's up?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Could I see your registration?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Check.
What kind of a car is it?
Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
How interesting.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
I don't know.
Harold Chasen.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
It's very interesting.
All right.
Maude???!
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Yes. Very much.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
What do you mean?
I don't know. Just one of those. 
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But this is public property.
Look, the ice is melting.
Yes.
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
Thank you.
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
What was that?
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Well, why don't you?
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
Well, don't go.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
She took my head.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Yes. They're old friends.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Maude.
I took them out.
Oh, Harold. 
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But why now?
It's true. I can't live without you.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
To a girl. Here.
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
None at all?
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Why?
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
The moment of truth.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Well, I don't...
Harold!
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
Oh, I do. I do.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
What?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What do you mean?
Because I'm going to get my father!
What are you talking...
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
It's been Hell.
I've come for my father!
Nonsense, I...
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
You mean, outside... with her.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
What is it?
In private, if you don't mind...
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
No. It was red. Bright red.
Reliquary --
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
Did he, now?
Got tired of me?
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Who?!
His what??!!
Each of us gets a belt.
No. Don't --
You call that thing a cigar??
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Father's back?  Still angry?
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Well good n-
Good night.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Good.
Marco...
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
A brute.
What about you?
That you feel that way about me.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.
What's the problem?
It'll go in.
It's just a puzzle box.
No!
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
HE did. I've seen him.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
You can keep them.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
You remember.
Frank --
Oh.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Oh my God.
What happened to you?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Ssh!
Who?
Tell me, damn you.
What kind of doors?
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Yes. They'll never find us.
So where's the harm?
The keys are in the kitchen.
I was here this afternoon.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
Ah!
It's just been empty a while.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
I hear you.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
You're NOT going to faint.
I'm going to throw up.
I'll be scarred for life.
Larry....
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Maybe a brandy.
Please. I can't bear it...
What are you talking about?
Drinking alone.
Do you care ?
That's right.
What's wrong?
What happened to me?
I got through.
I found a room.
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Take care, Dad.
I will. See you.
You like?
Kitchen's through on your left.
I love you, honey.
Really?
What?
Sure.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Finished?
I thought we'd lost you.
What do we do if there isn't?
We walk.
Meaning what?
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Can I lend you a hand?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
What things?
Will you GO, damn you?
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Oh, so what's the point then?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
But now I kind of like it.
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Fuck off, Barry.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
They always seemed...
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Uh.  That's me.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Yeah, sure...
Hey Rob.
Huh?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
I think you know that.
What were the others?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Never?
Will you please just go?
We'll talk some other time.
Have you slept with him yet?
I guess.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Mmm hmm.
I guess I am.
Pigsty.
Pig died.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Uh... No.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What do you want to do?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
What about Ian?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
What's happenin'.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Enough of what?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Nor have you!
Yeah.
Good.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
But you must have --
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Well we don't.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
No, we...
Fuck off.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
How old is Richard?
Yeah.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
Sure.
Fine.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Happy birthday.
Why?
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
No.
-Okay okay.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Very traditional.
It's not mine.
Grave robbers?
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Tradition.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'd rather hear yours.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No.  I had to talk to you.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
A factor of age.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Of bodies.
What about that family in '31?
You kill with your left hand?
Come here, Brenna.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
We've got nothing to say.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
Why?
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
How can you know this?
Pheasant.
You know me home.  Me name.
You are the same?
You feel you know me.
We are brothers.
What?
This is madness!
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Why?
Go to hell.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
But I did live.
Certainly not me.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Finish yours?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
It can be different.  It must be.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Must he go?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Figure she's with him?
Yeah.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
What are you doing here?
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
You're insane.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
Go to hell.
Should I care?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
What are you getting at?
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
I presume it's a sword.
A mystery.
He's mistaken.
Do you?
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Same.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Hello, Bensinger.
Excuse me, I just want to --
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Seventy-five.
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
The five hundred? Sure.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
Fine.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!
No. My mother.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
What do you mean by that?
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Sweeney.
Dead?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Bermuda.
He's in the insurance business.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Afraid? I should say not!
Now you got me.
No kidding?
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
Thank you.
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
I know. Where is he, I said.
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
Where's Bruce?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
What happened?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Will you come here?
Who did you talk to?
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Then why are you doing it?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
It'll be Heaven!
What's that -- what's that?
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
You grey-haired old Judas!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
It's a deal. Let me up.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Three bullets! Any good?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Call you back.
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
I'll have it in a minute.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
So long, Hildy.
That's all right.
With a bag of marshmallows.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
After all I've done for you --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Yeah. But I --
No, I couldn't do that.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
If there was any way out...
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
An attempt to ruin us!
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Just -- one -- second!
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
I never saw him before!
I won't.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
I can't.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
My name is Louis Peluso.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
All right, Judge.
Give me that!
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Come on with that money!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
Mother!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Isn't that her picture?
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Ssh!
Shut up, you!
Get the Governor on the phone!
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
No, I don't think so.
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
Is it hard?
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Come on, fellas.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
I give that marriage six months.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
No, she didn't.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Won't they have maps?
Ask her yourself.
Who with?
Pauline.
...and four and five...
It's like telling fibs.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
Who pays for them?
Where?
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Why not?
Except the servicemen.
I will if you will!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
They'd gone.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Where to?
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
No, I won't.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Up to six weeks, I think.
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
Father, that's enough now
How long?
Huh... what cone?
Cool.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
No, I told you...
Couple more miles up this road.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Wondering what?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Great story Goober, how much?
Holy crap, thanks!
Hey, wait take this.
But if you did.
But suppose for a second you did.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
OK, Boss.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Way out here?
Tasted pretty good.
Lock the fucking doors.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
What?
Fine! I'll go straight!
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
I hear ya.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
When?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
No please, let me sit this one out.
I resign.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
I still don't.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Huh?
Yes, sir.
What do they call you, sweety?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
Sorry.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Where we headed?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Like father, like son.
French?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oui. Perfect!
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Of course not.
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Fine.
Not in front of the boy.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
What for?
God, you're beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
Hunh.
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
That's Lila?
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
No. I married a midget.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Oh?
Lila, it's Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Oh, Rosie.
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
You've got to respect that.
You are a therapist, right?
Paper or cloth?
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
You do?
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
That's very funny.
I don't know. Something.
He looks perfectly fine.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
All right.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
I'm just preoccupied.
Do you like my new look?
Really?
Sure. Of course.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Have you?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as what womanly things?
I had sold my fucking soul.
So he's doing okay?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Oook. Oook.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Yahoo!
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
Next game, ten bucks.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
And a fact is a fact.
Do we need words?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
You know what's good for him?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You tell me.
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
Oh, about five hundred.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
What did he say?
Sit down.
Cut.
Only when I work.
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Whaddya been so far?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Seventy-five per cent.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
I been thinking.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
Where?
Over there by the bar.
'Bout even.
When do I raise the bet?
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Who's he?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
You don't need a drink.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
I asked around.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Aw, Eddie.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Yeah. Just like that.
That's right. When?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Since four.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
Do you always ask so many questions?
I used to be an actress.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
Fifth of scotch?
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Oh, I forgot.
What did all this stuff cost you?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Give it back to me.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
You wanna drink?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Would he know?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
You need the words?
I feel pretty.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
First time for everything.
What do you want to tell me?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Why?
Just for luck.
Well, what's the matter?
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Shut up.
That's right.
Twelve. Cross side.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Game's over, Eddie.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
I only protect myself -- !
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
Humans.
I don't know.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Why, Dad?
What did it look like?
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Yes -- but ...
George, you're acting very strangely.
Why, yes.  Why?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
We were having a little talk.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
Where, Jimmy?
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
The State Police.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Let's try.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
What? -- I... 
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
What's his family background?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Cool.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
I take it you've heard.
He's a good man.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Punched the President? Oh my god.
Love was never our problem.
I'll bet.
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
What're you talking about?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
I'm thinking.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
They don't know this.
Spunky?
I don't hear no fat lady.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
No Sir. Definitely not.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Butt-munch.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
We should leave too.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Deploy.
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Here... now.
What do you want us to do?
Die.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
And I am his.
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Dad was onto something here!
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
Pretty sure.
No?
Don't know. Think of something.
How do you know?
Out!
But what are you doing here?
I'll never forgive myself --
Dad, they come in through the doors.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Don't worry. He won't.
How did you she was a Nazi?
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Dad!
Oh.
What?
Brody's this way.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Very well. I'm here now.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
This could be close.
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Me?... Illumination.
We named the dog Indiana.
After you, Junior.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
A long time to wait.
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
Come on -- come on!
I'll take the camels.
But, Indy --
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
And why were you trying to kill me?
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
You think so?
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Miss Scott panicked?
Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
Yes, I understand.
Lao She.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Step on it, Short Round!
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
You don't like him do you?
Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.
What?
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
You're betrayed Shiva. 
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
What do you mean -- how?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Their children?
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Don't let it curl around you!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Don't catch cold.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
You've got to go to sleep now.
Go!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Who was it?
Yes?
Yes.
Why don't we go home?
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
That a new Datsun?
Me? What'd I do?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
You said it.
Loading a gun.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Of course you do!
Yeah.
Why he's argumentative?
With a man in my head...
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Too late...They want you.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
You gotta help.
Where are we going?
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
The man.
Gone where?
Nothing!
What about it?
I don't have any.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
The beach?
Swim.
Little late for that.
Why not?
What was?
Follow it.
How should I know?
What can I do? You're on your own.
What?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
No...you idiot!
...Rene...
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
This...is not going to work out.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Not her. You!
You got any books in there?
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
You get time off to sleep.
Osaka?
Follow her.
Run, stupid!
I can't keep up.
What do I do?
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
A hard left. A hard left.
Neither can they.

Come on.
Cash.
While he makes the run.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Gimme a minute.
Looks like you can have all you want.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
You've changed your mind.
Oh no!
They can?
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
The best part. She'll love it.
Dieter?
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
It's a long story.
Rene?
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
Newer, more powerful design.
They took the tapes.
He work for us?
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
I have a new client.
Enough ROmance.
We insist.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
And how do you service foreigners.
What?
Your memory.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Right.
How do I look?
Thanks.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Don't you want to get out?
What?
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
What did you say?
Then who did?
...right here too.
What way?
Why?
...I...don't know.
It's not apparent.
Disinterest?
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
Just Okay...
Who do you work for?
Trans Ocean Travel.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
Why didn't you tell me?
What did you tell them?
Why did they leave?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
You did.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
This business is over.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
How do you know you can trust me?
Then why are you smiling like that?
Who was?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Then where's the chip.
We figure out if it's in here.
How?
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
What'd...you forget?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Now what?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
For you.
What?
I've never met anyone like you.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
You're gonna laugh.
That's twenty feet high.
What about the others.
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
No?
What does he know?
Too much.
Whoever took it does.
What's new?
Okay.
What's that outside, Daddy?
You got a deal. 
Sure. Where?
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Yeah. Catch you later.
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Get me Wigand.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
How about you?
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Come again?
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
How are you, Jim?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Try the car.
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Where should I wash them?
Did you say Berman?
Hello? Yeah...
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Alright?
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
Hardly new news.
What?
Yeah, that's right.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Yeah... Thank you.
What I've seen... I've liked.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
If you want to do it.
Good. I want to talk to you.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Like what?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
I'll call them, Lowell.
I heard.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
What?
You greased the rails!
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
You try and have a good time.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
What?
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
She's okay.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Right.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Most certainly.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
It acts as a drug on the body?
That's why we hire scientists...
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
So she's uh, flourishing?
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Triple!
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Uh... poetry recitation.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
We did not.
What?
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
But you don't agree?
No.
Gotcha.
What is it you're after, Miles?
And you've always loved him?
No, that's not all.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Okay Miles.
Thank you.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Your mother was.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I want... I want to...
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Miles? You're scaring me.
What do you want?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Marylin?
No buts. Now. Out.
Marylin!
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Sometimes I forget.
Jesus.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Well what does he want?
He has a reputation for being tough.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
But you're going through with it?
So what?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
She's here now.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client has ruled that out.
That's delusional.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Heh heh.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Now Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Nothing?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
She always looked out for me.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Video.
Sorry.
I am very sorry.
No. You're not.
HA!
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She owes me a meal.
Do you have it?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Three is not Farrow.
Maybe next time.
And only two are hers.
How is she?
"I found a million dollar baby"
Come in. Sit down.
What ten thousand?
Who said anything about a reward!
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
We'll go into that some other time.
That's an evasion.
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
I'll get it annulled.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
What've you got against King Westley?
You only met him once .
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Oh, no.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
On the road.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
Well!
He's marvelous!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Why? Do you know him? 
I'm sorry you read it.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Lower the boats!
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Amateurs!
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
Are you talking to me?
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
I found it on the seat.
What are you talking about?
That's right. You didn't.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
You're on a budget from now on.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
Not at all. 
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Outside!
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Um. You're doing all right.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
You weren't so bad yourself.
I refuse to resign!
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Yeah.
No.
Okay. Hang on to these.
Yes.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
What?
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
Here. Eat your head off.
But what!
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
I hate the horrid stuff.
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, no!
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
We don't need forty cars.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
You bet I did.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Come here, you little fool!
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Left twenty minutes ago.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Thank you.
Yesif he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
Why, he'll be back.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
SorryI didn't mean to
What's that?
Yes?
Eight o'clock.
I said, the old man's screwy!
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
What!
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
You!
Yeah.
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
Well, you got one now. Come on, fill 'er up.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
A trumpet?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Mebbe.
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
There's a seat over there for you.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Go on, Willie.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
No, I did not.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Why Galveston?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
That's our case!
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
No.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
David Ferrie.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Take a look across the street.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
How many men?
No.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
No, it can't!
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
You're so naive, mister.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
How many men are working with you on this?
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
That sounds fun.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Yes.
Uh huh.
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I'll call her.
You.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Course you didn't.
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
She wants to make a deal.
She sound scared?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Suspicion of what?
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
Bet you're happy to be working again.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Who do you think I am?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Is it dark?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
What did they want to know?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I didn't?
It was the other guy who busted me.
With ten thousand? Nine.
Cash poor?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Black's fine.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Yeah.
Sure.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
Are you?
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
We talked.
It's different with men.
What'd ya see?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
How old's Annette?
They seem to like the idea.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
I called you last night.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
You know some interesting people.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
You do that?
That's my job.
Which one?
What if I've figured a way?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
He's liable to shoot you.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
You'll get over that.
I thought you were tired of your business?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
We can look into that.
You know what we want.
You never asked me if I did or not.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
Uh-huh.
Yes. All those things are true.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I have no idea.
So what happens now?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Great...  ...Wanda!
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Yeah, do you like it?
You betcha.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Go sit over in that chair.
It's true, isn't it?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
I don't know. One of your friends.
A woman.
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
No, I give it to someone else first.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Uh-huh.
I need to talk to you alone.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
How do you know she did that?
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
Man, I don't like that part.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She don't know shit about the money.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Where at?
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
It's a diet thing?
Yeah.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
So where did you go?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
Detroit.
We had done time together already.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You been to Japan?
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
Must of made quite an impression.
Sure.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Okay, Lou-is.
Who's your partner?
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Guess where I am?
You're outside?
What did he do?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Not now, pick me up.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
You know how she is.
Pretty sure.
In the chest and stomach.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Came outta where?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
You gonna tell me who it was?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Gonna have to put up cash.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
You don't say.
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
I need your name and address.
House or apartment?
Yes.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Hear what?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
What does she do for you?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
She got off, huh?
Uh-huh.
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
You sure?
I'll give you his beeper.
Where do you want to go?
I'm alive.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Like Della.
Hello, Sam.
No, don't. But thanks.
Oh God!
Daddy. Let go.
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
Oh, terrific.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
It was the window.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
How long had that been going on?
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Sarah.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She hates me, Louis.
I can't relax.
What?
Louis, you're a life saver.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Jake, you need to rest.
Ah!
No.  I see them.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Who did?
Don't ask.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
They're like demons, Jez.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.
We're at Della's.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
That's your decision.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Am I home?
While you were in the shower.
Why didn't you call me?
He said you didn't have one.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I can do anything I want.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
Are you out of your mind?
I can waitress. I'm good.
Bullshit!
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm not upset.
I'm tired.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Then don't bug me.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Sit down, Jake.
Where have they gone?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
Who then?
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
No. I couldn't.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
If you're lucky.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Jacob Singer?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
I don't know.
Who is?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
A car accident.
Pour it in.
On top of him?
Speaking of which, duck!
Pause play.
Yes it does.
Alright, asshole.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
We're not leaving Crutch!
Could you show a little compassion?!
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
I don't know. Nothing.
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Thorgan, pull us in.
And you said high school was boring.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Hey, easy now.
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
What?
Where is he?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Fuckin A...
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Eat me.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
Old woman?
Oh I like her a lot.
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
We're screwed.
He's right behind us!
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
He was chasing me!
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Just get us to the ship!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Thank you.
Let's just get out of here.
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Barbie from hell...
You killed him?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Nanotechnology.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
That's right, now if you could...
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Three...two...one...
Sure but what good will that do?
I want him out of the ocean.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
I know who he is...
What do you mean 'We...?'
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Who's driving the boat?
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Older, sillier.
Where is he?
Thank you.
Can you do that?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
I'm going home.
Just sign it, Larry.
Who are you?
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Let's all have a drink.
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Our friend, the shark.
What? What?!
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
That means closing the beaches.
I wish it would rain...
Some friends and me took a house.
What's the matter with my printing?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Anti-Shark cage.
Who's inside, you or the shark?
Ever see one like this?
The shaft is giving.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Cool.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Well, I do.
We could get back together too.
Were we together?
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Yeah. That was me.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
You know it's okay.
It does?
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Shut up.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Junk?
We definitely want it to have junk.
Hey, I like this.
You don't have to do that.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
That suits you.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Why? What the big deal?
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Consider it your musical education.
Go learn something.
Come on, I have something for you.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What's the matter?
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Room with a toilet, got it.
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Wow! It's magical.
Juno MacGuff.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
You're not listening to me.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
A Pilates machine?
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
They're yellow.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
And I disagree.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What?
What are you referring to?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
She answered our prayers.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
A hotel?
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...Thank you.
That French ain't it?
Is it hard to learn?
He whips you?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
How'd you meet Early?
You can?
...Anything else?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Early, sing me a song.
Walter Livesy.
Turkey mostly.
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Brian.
Henry Lucas.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
You wanna hear mine?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
If you say so.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
I still think we should have met them first.
Up yours.
Then try again, 
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
Shut your mouth.
...Janitor's job.
Without his car?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Yes!
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
To what? Virgins?
What do you mean?
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
What do you want?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Probably.
Den less go Joe.
Yeah.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
It's no big deal, right?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Bet.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Yeah.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Fifteen for me.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Where you at?
You goin'?
Yeah.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Is it cold?
She won't? Why not?
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
Yes.
Come on.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
No...
Here. Swallow.
Why?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
Of course I do.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
Thanks.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Oh shit.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Yeah.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
I can't man.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
No.
What?
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Let's see how much he wants to play.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
How'd you get in here?
No it wasn't.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Homesearchers.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
Run it down.
Local?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Why not?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
What?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
You know her?
Because she's the type.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
The police haven't told you?
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
The pipes.
Thanks.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
Why did he what?
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
My cheering section.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
Okay.
For what?
How long has she been dead?
No Frank.  No prints.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
We're not sure.
--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
But we heard him.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
This ain't no photo.
What did he mean by Huxley?
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
About a quarter to one.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I got it from the tournament directory.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
I want to be the best I can.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
We'll call you back.
What are they, please?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Uh huh.
Yes.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Of course.
Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
Why?
You're not?
Because I think he's wrong.
I'm sure you are.
I'm sorry.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
You've got to face the things you feel.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Can I come in?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
You don't understand.
But I do.
Why?
Of course not.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I don't have to go through with it either.
Well, you're beautiful.
<u>What</u>?
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
I will find you. I will be with you.
I know it.
All the passages are guarded.
I don't know how.
All directions are the same here.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
But there is another entrance to this place.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
I'm not sure.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
No! You cannot know that!
Each to his fate.
I don't think that.
Even by you?
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
These we'll pay for.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
A flicker of talent.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
We'll meet you at the inn.
And mine goes with you.
Sugarballs?
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Hush!
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
No. He will master the leader.
Then look!
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
The new King.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Her name is Death.
She had another name once.
Fewer will survive them.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
Ynyr!
She bore you many children?
You had a son.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Of what?
You lie!
Yeah... How do you know it?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
130... 140...
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
Yes.
Mathilda?!
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
I love you so much, Leon.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
...Don't you like me?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
...Yes.
I don't know... Five minutes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
I have no fear.
Huh, that's good!
Huh?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Ten dollars... A month.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
No... Dino's.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
...Yeah.
Where?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
I'll make it.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I'll kill you!
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You do?
I've seen it before.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Yes.
You're talking to me?
Show me.
I will -- I promise.
Please tell me.
I've changed my mind.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
It'll make it.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Where?
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
From where?
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You tell stories?
Who's telling this story?
What was that?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
You're amazing.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
California.
Walking where?
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
I need your help.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Evening News?
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
This isn't right.
What are my choices?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
No.
Hello.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
To death?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
You do?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Can we just forget it?
Can we just ignore it?
No... we already talked about that.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Will you lighten up, please?
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
How much, do you think?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Please, Yuri.
Where have you been staying?
Sera... please go.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
I loved him!
I'll take that as a no.
Who?
That's not what's important.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
Who could better understand than me?
I believe you! Don't worry.
No.
I guess.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Yes.
Because they got wet.
Is everything okay?
Thank you.
Yes, I am.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
That's terrible!
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Definitely! I love him!
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
I'm so happy for you!
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
You're kidding!
Really?
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Power yoga?
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
No, she can't move for an hour.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
And you know this for a fact?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Projecting joy is not my job.
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
Are you asking me on a date?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
What do you think?
What happened?
Are you sure?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
Where's Warner?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Maybe she found him like that.
That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Uh -- sure.
Do anything exciting?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Well, yeah, but --
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
Thank you.
Really?
Where?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
It's not a Theta --
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Then we smash 'em?
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
Purely a precaution...
Always.
We go out, smash 'em now?
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
Your love.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
You're magnificent.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
Oh, yes...
And then?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Might we watch, too?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
And, now?
Or looked so beautiful...
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You come stealee tleasoo?
We be honored, friend Ogg.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
No... I... I need to rest.
What!
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I fear she's lost.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Don't you know?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
Careful, lad.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Track the demon to his lair.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Jack, don't!
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
The wound is mortal.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
I don't... understand.
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
Sunlight, you say?
Mean you to seek him out below?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Sunlight.
Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
Hurry up!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
I'll try.
Three cheers for our champion.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Unicorn?
Stop complaining.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Be patient.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Jack!
To fetch your napkin.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Who?
He did run?
Tis the truth.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Jack... Forgive me...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Pinching?  Where?
Everywhere!  Ow!
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
I'd be honored.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
And as barren of love as stone.
Be fair, Oona.
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Up ahead!
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
That very nice.
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
I thought I might stop by.
Oh.
Has he eaten anything at all?
No.
Nope.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Tell him I said "hi".
I might not stay, anyway.
No.  That's okay.
I wanted him to marry her.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I'm coming in.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Josh said...
Not really.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to Catalina.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
And if I enclosed it?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
A sink?
Pardon me?
He buys and sells the world.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
What can I do for you, George?
I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.
Oh...okay.
George, this is the third time.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
I'll be around to check up on you.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
I'll hate you forever.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
I almost saw Catalina.
You'll have money when you work.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
I can promise you complete privacy.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
Well, until you know, you can't go.
The gloves on the table are for you.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
I like how it feels not to feel.
What I'm not.
What do you know about me?
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I'm telling you now.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
What would you be doing now?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
I still don't know what that means.
Good for you.
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Can you build a house in four months?
I can die trying.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Thanks for telling me.
At least your father tried, George.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Three.
Because Dad left?
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Four days.  I left to think.
Kurt's been feeding him.
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
Why would they tow your truck?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
I love those doors.
I drove over and you were gone.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
Well, for later then.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Do you remember?
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
This was my very first slow dance.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
That was the truth.
You've never said that before.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I can't pick you up.
What did he say?
So could I.
It's not my back that's killing me.
Don't even...I'm there.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
A man he respects.
I'll make you something.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
I guess I could teach you some things.
Okay.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
This is what he wants.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
What did you say?
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
In the bedroom.
Better make it a week.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Take care of me?
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Want me to come back some other time?
Yes, boss.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
But I'm having a good time...
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Good old Monroe.
Nothing.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
My daddy gave me this watch.
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Yeah, I want some pie.
So you made a generous contribution.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Forget it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
What do you want, Claude?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
The hell you talking about? What train?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
What am I gonna eat?
Him?
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
That's the way it is.
Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Back to New York for starters.
Don't make me take them away from you.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
You didn't get ketchup?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Move it out.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
1932? That's like, that's like...
What were they, bootleggers?
Just like Elvis.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
He must still be in there.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Something like that, yes.
Jenny?
No, it says Marleen here.
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Satchmo.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's a long story...
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
You found him.
Blacks welcome there?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
Understood.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Is this a joke?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
All right. Let me out.
Uh. No it won't?
I'm calling you out, brother...
You want a queen? Got one right here.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
An angel?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
It would be so okay.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
You did it for Namath.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
That's what I'm thinkin'...
That's a pretty brassiere.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Should we wake him up?
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Peppermint... alright.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
You followed him?
Dude. Seriously?
I'll just go to Heaven.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
You think I'm a tourist?
The South.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
School?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
Good. I was concerned.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
I think I'm floating.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
I love you.
I feel sorry for you, boy!
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
It'll be all right...
We're ready.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Not in my time...
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
Of course.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
You felt sad. What's your name?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And now?
Curious.
Not about that.
I'm listening.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
You know something.
How can I?
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
That's tomorrow.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
Uh-uh.
Let's see -- how long has it been?
No. Not that either.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
How will they know we're coming?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
For us.
And yours.
I doubt it.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
All this. All of it.
Where are you going?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
What makes you think so?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
Alive?
Yes...
Can you make it back?
Oh my... I'll try.
Too little.
Listen.
Sure, I'm okay.
Yes, I thought my wife...
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Yeah... Laurent.
Ours, Ed.
You know what I think?
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Yeah.
Sit down a minute.
What's up?
Yeah? what did they want?
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
The wife killer?
Yes.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
You talk to him?
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
No, sir, it's not.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
He won't give his name.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Not even close.
A headache?
No.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.
Who's it from?
No, nothing.
Maybe.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
Thanks, guys.
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
The heart, I guess.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
All right!
I can see that.
At sixty?
Pornos?
Okay.
What?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
We just killed a couple of people...
You were acting like a different person.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Thank you.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
Well, what do you know about that!
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Uh-huh.
I see.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
No kidding?
Yes.
Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
Just call me Barney.
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
How do you do?
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
buy and sell?
Who?
Well, is it?
108 and still active?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Suppose she should leave it?
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Oh, immediately.
Oh, dear.
How can we get in touch with them?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Hey!
Yes.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
What are you talking about?
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Did I say "if"?
That's what you said.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Porters?
Porters?
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
I don't see that there's anything to say.
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
I'd go mad!
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Why not?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
Yes, everything!
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
What if he refuses?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
Thank you.
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
I'd love it!
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
All right, I'll be there.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
I guess I lost:
And Goodwill Toward Man?
I gotta be honest about something.
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
Mrs. Edelson?
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Actually, sir--
All the time, sir.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Yup.  Sure is.
I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Gee.  You really think?
And what's this ... ?
What?
I think that's what's happening...
How does that help me?
All of it?
in case I need it?
Kay!?
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Are you sure you don't?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
Actually, yeah--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
What if I don't?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Come again?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
Did it leave?
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
Is it now?
He won't.
Wait.
Someplace safe.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She died?
Because I found out about her...
It's all I could safely move.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
You made those tapes...
How do I find the --
Here --
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Kill type?
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Uh-huh...
Don't apologize, John.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
I go running down there.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Can you fake the cerebral output?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
I'm not getting halo'd.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Now look at him...
We're in motion on something.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
You mind if I tag along?
Because it was going to fall.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
Flaws.
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
She said...
So?
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Wanna hear something funny?
Oh, Sean --
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
You're not gonna kill me...
Good-bye, Crow.
Heal who?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You're talking about the precogs...
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I believe in that system...
Which one is that?
The female.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
He's my subordinate!
What?
This murder is happening at two different times.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Right here.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
We can stop him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
No.  He can't...
How many?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Cream and sugar.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
But John was with him at the pool?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
When served warm --
I can take you down there.
Are you sure?
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
What if I gave you forty?
Where's the place to go tonight?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Women?
It's on West Broadway.
See you later.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
He's great, right. Is he great?
We used to take baths together.
Come on. Let's go.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Bullshit.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Uncle Bobby?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Draw.
Get away from her.
Yeah. Where is he?
When's it going down?
What's that?
Ruiz tied in out there?
How so?
Sure. Yeah.
Me? No. Not really.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Then what are you saying?
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
He'll work it off.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Good morning.
Nah, man...
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Traveling light. I like that.
Depends what night.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Yeah.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
What are you saying?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
How am I being shitty?
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
I think we might.
I'll beat your ass --
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
What are we delivering?
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
I like it.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
Who's driving her?
I don't know.
Is that the woman from..?
Pretty nice.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
How much is it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Great. On my fucking room.
Oh really. Why's that?
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
How'd they know who you were?
So they said more than the address.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
He woulda told us right?
You got that right.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
She was jonesing for me.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
The penguin house.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
We don't need guns.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
What do you have left?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You did?
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
I'm sorry...
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
No more, man.
So what do we do?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Well, come on then. It's back here.
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
He's on the list.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
A little.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Stop.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
No?
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Word.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Different.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
That money is your per diem.
Keys.
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Edinburgh.
And where might that be?
Who's up for a night on the town.
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
How 'bout that?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Lemme write it down for you.
Yes, sir.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Nnnnnnn!
Bet you are.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You never had it.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
That really you, Red?
Yeah.
Man, what do you want?
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Elijah who?
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
What do you do with your time?
Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Where am I gonna start?
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I don't know how.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
Come, sit with us.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Delicious.
I can handle it.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
We need you too!
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Just what are you saying?
Yes, sir, I did.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
Now you come back.
I ain't stupid.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Your control over your children, therefore --
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
500.
Let me die then.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You better believe it.
Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Fine as May wine.
Tell him about Baldy.
Yeah.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
What can you do?
So what about him?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
He's bright.
No.
What do you want?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[South America.]
[I have a friend there.]
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
I have connections.
Deal.
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[What is his name?]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The what?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[And I had my men ready.]
Yes.
Show me, please.
Have you used this type before?
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
What do you mean, I'm here?
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
How long you staying, Crease?
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
I came to visit you.
I said the plan was right here.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
No.
Not at all?
Do you think he'll come back?
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
You need to practice.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
Never.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Camila. Camila Valencias.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
When?
You do?
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Hmm?
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
It's not.
He has to go.
[Is that good or bad?]
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
What?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Where?
Down there. That little one there.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
It's early.
Where you going?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
I came to see you. How you feel?
I don't think I remember him.
It's her baby too, you know.
Well, it ain't your baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
It pains that they should do this.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
I'll wait for your call.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
I'll see you around.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
Sure.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
What didn't you like about her?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Hiya.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Right.
Hello, Thomas.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
They give you copies to burn.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
Pour one for Painless.
He said it for us all, Walt.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Or her figger.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
Wisconsin.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
An application to Androscoggin College.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
When?
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
I have a tent to myself.
We're a good team.
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Right.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
What's the age of consent in this country?
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
Our minds?
Very happily married.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
You really say the cutest things.
Yes, Reverend?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
They missed the boat.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
There's only one worth noticing.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Just in dreams?
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Your tent?
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
Yes, sir?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Yes, Colonel.
I can try, sir.
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
Arterial silk.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Are you all right?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Against what?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Oh. Yeah.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, butthere you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Yes, sir.
Thirty dollars.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
A third party?
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
What?
You bet I will, Ma.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Sorry.
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Oh!
Thank you.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
That's
He's watching the other door.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Where is she?
Go out and find her!
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Shut up!
Look!
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Who's got him?
Who are they?
Sure. Mostly often.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Yeh.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
No, I didn't.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Did you write itor didn't you?
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
Thanks.
Flowers.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Okay.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
I won't get away with it.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Am I gettin' the car?
You're gettin' the car.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Automatic.
You got it.
Is there a problem?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Earl.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Is that all?
Only at the very end.
Like it had to be done.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
National Marksman Competition.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Is there something wrong with that?
I'm not sure.
Not the ones I'm at.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
We see each other every couple of months.
I'm not good at lying.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
Yeah, first and second.
We won.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
So what do you want to do?
That's a chance I gotta take.
Which apartment?
Only that floor.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
I worship you.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
If you did, you never showed it.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
...Let me just show you.
Use your imagination.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Yeah.
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
SHIT!
What?
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
You let us worry about that.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
What happened to your Trans Am?
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it?
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Yeah, they are but...
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
Yes.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
To live forever.
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
No...
Just like you always wanted.
No.
Not my problem.
It's not real.
Yes...
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
At least a day.
The woman you're stuck on.
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
And you weren't involved.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
-- Who did he digitize?!
Katie was digitized.
Then where is she?
Where?
Cleaning up a mess.
Some things never change, do they?
No.
Night City.
You weren't real.
Yes.
There was no other choice.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
Why not?
Describe program function.
-- Standard.
Zordon...  he's gone.
Yeah, right.
Stylin'!
There should be a way to open it.
... Let's take a look over there.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
... We must try to communicate with them.
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
About twenty seconds in your time.
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
We could smell it's breath.
A stellar idea, Skull.
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
GO IVAN!!
What do you mean "basically"?
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
You've got the public upset, Al.
But I've never served a day.
Charlie Luciano.
Not another word.
Whatever you say, Boss.
So what happened?
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Who hired the bastard?
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
It always is.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
How soon can we pull this off?
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I'll do fine.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
I know about you.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Didn't know you felt that way.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Not if they all die at once.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Not stupid. Fat.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
I've got friends.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
You get fifteen percent.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You disrespect our tradition.
Masseria's been after me too.
We can operate around these guys.
The Big Picture.
So change it.
Spare us.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Come on. Be polite.
Jesus.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Luciano is dead?
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
This is nice. I mean it.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
What?
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Five CC's.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
I didn't say anything.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Well - you'd need a body.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Back? You're sending me back?
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Less.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Why?
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
YOU SET ME UP!!
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Monkeybone...!?
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
I might wake up.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
All right. You can come.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Mm hmm.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
... Oh ...
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Yes. Mostly "Puss."  Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play.
You play--left field.
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
Paine.
Drunks are funny--
Yeah.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Shut up, Diz.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Is the wind tired out there?
What?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
No--not offhand--
Huh?
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
That infernal phone!
What is it?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Nonsense.
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
How do you feel, champ?
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Ma! Hold him!
Himself!
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
What stuff?
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Yes. Come in.
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
What? Who?
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Yes, I was--
For a *question*.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
We'd better see.
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
No!
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Did you say--bus?
There *what* was?
Most natural thing in the world!
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
A *day*!
Why?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Yes, I see that.
Good. Where are we?
What's that?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
*This* is.
We're over in the House.
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Have you always had to--work?
Since sixteen or so.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Why?
Lena.
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Must have been tickled pink.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Do you want to dictate them?
Oh--*Saunders*!
Wow!
Saunders--
Oh--you are!
Well! You don't say!
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
How's that, buddy?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Well--I have got *one* idea--
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
What's the matter?
That's dynamite, Joe!
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Why don't you do it yourself?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Who are you?
Some people like it.
Certainly.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes.
Yes, I
Who's that?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Uh-huh.
And sings.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Uh-huh.
No, no children.
Thank you very much.
Next, please.
No.
Why not?
Are these the articles?
Are they true!
That's all, Miss Bennett.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
What?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Really?
Oh, I don't mind.
What are they going to do?
Huh?
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
Yeah, I know.
He did?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
No. It's nothing.
Uh-huh.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
We're not going out tonight.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
Is he really that big a sap?
Had the boys follow us.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
When're you going to see him again?
With pay!  She is out the door.
Yes.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Right.
Hurry up!
Shhh!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Yes, but you said
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
Let me go!
Proceed.
Mr. Cedar!
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Hang up.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
You can't?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Where?
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
No, thanks.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
That's funny. Why is that?
What're you talking about?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
They can have the Estate.
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Me?!
Naturally.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
No, I mean - about my client.
Huh?
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Now wait a minute, buddy
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Uh-huh.
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
South Dakota - but on the top.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me. What did you say?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
No!  What do you want!!
Really? You think so?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
You must have been concerned.
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
Not any more.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Are we?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
No?
I never said that.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
But you did come to me.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Althea hasn't told you?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
She seems very unhappy.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Yeah.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
It's a pretty piece of land.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Doc.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
Did you straighten her out?
What kind of doctor are you?
Oh... not a real doctor.
No, I really don't.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Really? What would it take?
Sorry... I'm done.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Be specific.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Disgusting.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
It's all right.
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Um-huh.
I think so.
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
In maybe three or four issues.
It's my bit for the community.
Have women found you attractive?
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
How are you?
Have you thought about getting a wife?
This is exactly what I wanted.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Amazing.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Uh-huh.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
It matters to me.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
You and Candy...?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
English Lit.
You want my advice? Far out!
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
What'd I do?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And then killing your sister.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
In the desert? What for?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
You always did have more balls than brains.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
And what did he say?
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
Fifty percent.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
Every damn day.
What did you find? What did you see?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Trust me.
Are you sure?
For entering the afterlife.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Something like that.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
You dream about dead guys?
That bad huh?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
That's what I am to you? A contract?
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Got what?
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
I think you found something.
I'm your sister.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Read the inscription on the cover!
Awfully.
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Of course.
What --?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Fantasizing... about you.
Do I?
I'm his daughter.
The Disco Boys.
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
But you're a superhero.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
He's dead.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Why bother?
Captain who?
Are you with me... or against me?
You're dead.
Frankenstein!
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Then why are you here?
You're a spy.
Yeah.
Sure.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Have you always lived here?
What have they got that we ain't got?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Monica, where are you?
I'm going inside.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
I just know.
When are you going to take off that mask?
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
He is in love. His anger is gone.
We had an off night, that's all.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
Yeah.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
But I just don't feel it.
I'll drive.
Not a chance!
With what?
So why don't you just tell her!
Why not?
See ya tomorrow.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Yes.
Anybody got any?
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Oh hi, Mom.
Mother... it's not what you think!
It is?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
What do you mean?
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
Please...
May I come to the map?
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Cavalry?
There are none here.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
Fair enough.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
I'm not insulted.
You realize what is at stake?
And who is defending Paris?
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
But who made this treaty?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Yes, sire?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Come in.
Let me see it.
Yes, sir.
You may go, Captain Charles.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Bastia -- and you?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
My God, what a fire!
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
That is correct.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
No, sir.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh...?
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Thank you.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
And you, Junot?
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
And now?
Of course.
No.
Promise me.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
That's all I can say.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
I couldn't face telling you.
Can you give me a drink, please?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
No.
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
Does she deserve anything better?
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Yes, he has.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Send him in.
Let me have it.
Send him in.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
And I can go free?
Go, fo' I change my mind.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Well, let me in.
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Y'all never use it?
Why you say that?
I don't know!
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Yup.
Don't move me.
No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
I'll do it.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
I can't taste nothing.
You walked?
Okay, plan B.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
I don't know yet.
I didn't see nothing.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
You go first.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
What about me?
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
What it smell like?
It's alright.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
Smokin' what?
Nothing.
Excuse me?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I don't have no damn cover.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Negative...they vamped.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I know.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Where's Craig?
Ya'll live around here?
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
He's a boy, dude.
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
I got fired too.
What?!
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
I don't know the number.
Huh?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Take your car.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
Business or pleasure?
Business.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
The grave. Somebody close?
I...
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
That's right.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
What?
What the hell are you saying?
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Yes.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Yes, I'm listening.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Me?
He's dead?
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
You fucked up.
I kill her - and you kill me.
No, that's,..that's fine
No! You can't! They're in on it.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
Okay...
Right.
Over and out.
I promise.
I'm just an accountant.
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Is within himself.
Keep it.
I remember. The big tipper.
Please. Something is going to happen...
That's right.
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
Yeah, all right, listen...
Thank you.
What!?
What are you going to do now?
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
I've done much better ones than this.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
A surprise?
Shut up.
'Daddy has to go now.
Do it!
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
You, Preacher?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Dad, you're bleeding...
I will guard Pearl with my life...
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Don't!
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
It's a shame!
Ah.
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
There! What's so hard about that!
Blue men.
You better not sing that song.
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
She's gone to Moundsville.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
John, where are we g --
Hush.
That's Daddy!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
She talks to herself.
Dead.
Up river.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Is that all?
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
It -- she --
Come on, children!
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Why sure, boy, sure.
Yonder.
Under the stone in the floor.
You could save him, little bird.
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
No.
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
Ahh!
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
No, Harry! I thought --
Get up.
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
What's wrong, John?
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
The man! The man!
No, nothing.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Because he was scary, that's why.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Haven't slept, have you?
You believe in anything?
Used to. Not anymore.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Who?
You do?
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
How you plan to do that?
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Okay. Hi, dad.
He's dangerous.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
I won't.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Of course. What's that?
Naturally, Comrade.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
Well, a hat...
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
And there?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Possibly.
Right now it's on the balcony.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
What is it?
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Which part of the room is mine?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Have you?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
No, sir.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
It is Thursday!
While you eat, you look at the view.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Get out of here!
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I'll send you a muff.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
A day.
Brave... that's right.
Monsieur.
Right away... instantly!
No, thank you.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
What business?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
You believe in our cause?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Why should I take a chance?
On what?
What for... why?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Gladly.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
How long does it take a man to land?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
So that is your house?
Please don't misunderstand me...
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Ni-notchka.
Thank you.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You repeat yourself.
Don't do it, please.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
It's false sentimentality.
No, that was restful. Again.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
As a representative of Moscow...
You know I want to...
Then how did you get here?
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
What?
At what?
Because we are an odd couple.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
No.
I don't think so.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Ninotchka, I love you.
You must, darling.
What, darling?
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
No. Nobody will find us.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
No! No!
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
Much happier.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...but big.
Who cried that one?
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
Please.
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Oh, yes.
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
No.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
You can't imagine.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana, you did.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Am I interrupting?
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Yes.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
What is this, Swana?
Has done what?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
We have nothing to discuss.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
In that case I can only say good-by.
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
Unfortunately.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Yes.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I will do my best.
Raw carrots and beets.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
Where do you eat?
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Where the hell is he?
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
So you tell Mitchell ...
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
No, sir.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
There's no secrets here, Al.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
For what?!
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
That's right ...
I don't know anything about that.
I know it well, sir.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
Their fourth!
Yes, you approved it, sir.
I did?
What do you mean, sir?
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Run 'em over.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Yes ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
I never met the man.
The old queen did it on purpose.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Kissinger?
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
What do you mean, Jack?
No, Henry.  I don't.
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
Yeah ...
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Yes, Mr. President.
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
That has the added virtue of being true.
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
How about Kissinger along with him?
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Jesus Christ!
That was a long time ago.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Syracuse.
Ernie Davis.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
POWs.  And their families.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I want a divorce.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Yeah ... I'm out.
I'll never run again.  I promise.
You don't have to go.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Then I'll be there for you.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Hiding what?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
What?
The "crises"?
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
You don't know what he thinks.
Yes I do.
Yes.
Nothin'?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
The old boy shot by the highway?
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Llewelyn Moss?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Mm.
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
I don't know. Oh.
No sir.
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
Okay.
You gonna drive out there?
Yessir.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
Don't get hurt.
I can't plan your day.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...I need to sit down.
No. But I gave my word.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
What? Quit hollerin'.
Goin' out.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Yes I do.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Uh-huh.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Llewelyn?
I shall return.
What did you tell him?
What makes you say that?
I can hear it in your voice.
She'll be all right?
Why would I let you do that?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Yes I did.
You expect him?
Step out of the car please, sir.
Screwgie.
You from around here?
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't need to talk to you.
Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
So what're you goin' up there for.
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
With what?
See about closing.
Yessir.
Sir?
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
Well...
You said that.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Everything.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Uh-huh.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
You on all night?
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
November the 28th, last year.
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
What do you want to know?
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
The what?
The option.
No, one forty-two.
What else then?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Sugar?
I know how he found me.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not any way.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
No I don't have it.
I don't know. American citizens.
You do, I reckon.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Yeah?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
You're lying!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Tell him what you told me.
That's a nice name for what you need...
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
No, I was just... How you doing?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, this is wonderful...
I am?
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
This is really awkward...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Oh, Betty --
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Do what?
You told me that two hours ago.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Yes... maybe it was.
David, please --
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I ran back in to get the phone.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
...well, then you ain't got much.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
You're in serious danger!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
Los Angeles, California.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Did you love it?
That's horrible!
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
I'll go to the Hospital.
Worse.
You made out alright.
I came for love. My fianc is here.
Man, that is love.
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
You never know who you'll see.
You still in love?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
Where are you going?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Really. And where was that, old man?
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Fine. You got five...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Of what?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
I... I don't know...
My socks?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
He told us it's in the Buick.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Like... us?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
What?
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
I never said that I believed...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
You made your point...  I was wrong.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
What's wrong with you?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Can I have an evil twin?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I said I'll think about it.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I SAID FORGET IT!
Because it ain't natural, young man.
No... before that.
Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
I swear to God!
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
Waitaminute -
- but now it deposits you here.
You can't do this -
Hang on there -
- and share one of your graves.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Izzat right?
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Oh my God!
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
That ain't it!
Okay, Pappy.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Suckin' away.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
No weddin'.
That's not my ring.
You -
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Well, we need that ring.
Well sure, honey, but...
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Isn't it, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
It was a powerful air.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
He's a suitor!
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
Okay, okay. You win.
Thank you, sir!
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Yeah, I know.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
I wrote. Not every week...
I never said any of that!
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Great. You can go in my place.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
When did this happen?
A long time ago.
Not exactly, sir.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
No, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
It's important, sir!
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
Where are you from, boy?
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
Yes, sir!!
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
How late?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
One more minute.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Yeah... Mmmm...
Everything was different.
I do.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Really?
Be a friend. Leave.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
That's it?
You're better than candy.
Any time, sailor.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
That's okay. I'm used to it.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
What would you do differently?
Your real father?
So?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Why?
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
He said he grew up poor?
Naw.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Do you know that for sure?
It's mine.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
This is ridiculous...
Th --
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
I did.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Open it.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Nobody leaves.
The furniture guy?
Open the door.
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Got us in here, didn't I?
0150.
Chills?
Huh uh.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Come on, come on...
I saw something, I saw...
Blue is phones?
He won't even know who it was.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm sorry.
What?
Not an option.
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Judge, calm down.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Are you finished?
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
No sir he didn't.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
So talk...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
So what's the deal?
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
No man. Gonna walk.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Just the legit shit.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
All of the above, man...  And then some.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yeah.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
You believe that?
I don't know. I really don't.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
Congratulations.
That would be nice.
I expect to try.
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
Pride will do.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Of course, I do.
What unit?
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
I will do so as soon as possible.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
I consider them linked.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Sir.
I understand, sir.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
The middle colonies?
And the Governor?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
You're in no condition to ride.
Is that so?
Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
He tried.  It didn't take.
How old are you?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
What?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Where?
You know what happened.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
And what do they know?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
Go on.
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
It's Mister Marion.
I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
Thirteen years...
Name five hundred.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
Who's in command?
Long time.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
It is ended.
Four, five miles.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
God willing.
But father, they might come this way.
Put them away.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Because you promised.
I hate that smell.
That's enough, Ellen.
Huh?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Do you believe that?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
What's at the end of it?
I think it is so, Ellie.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Does she love the cat?
You keep saying that.
Whose burying ground?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
I guess so...but...
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
Because it's right.
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Good d--
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
Yes, I guess I do.
You're doing fine.
I will.
Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
Elizabeth goes free!
I'll torture it out of you.
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Track you down and --
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
That's fair.
What're you suggesting?
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Or you could surrender.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Yes -- yes.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
If I had known --
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
The trees are taller.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
More to drink!
Exactly.
What's your plan?
First -- have you found me a crew?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
I know.  That was for the smell.
We're not going to just surrender!
This must be some important boat.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Because you're a pirate.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
... No.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Where did he come from?
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
No.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
No.  I'm getting used to it.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Considering what?
What I asked you earlier?
Poppy, this is not the time!
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
So, I guess it worked.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Been out for six months now.
Same old Daniel.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Right.  You predicted it.
That's what I thought.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The waste.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
You're the doctor.
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Blame the victim.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Probably the caffeine.
No cheese.
Yes.
I have to!
We were different people then.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Oh yeah?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Yes - Sing Sing.
Goodbye, Stew
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
For what?
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Now let's get this settled
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Stewart!
You're acting like a child.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Mother!
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Oh, man!
Is that so?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Well - it's only April.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Yes, sir.
That's so.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
What play?
Dawson, sir.
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
I bet.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
My error.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
There you are!
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Okay.
What do you know about Conrad?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Right.
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Very good.
Yeah?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Sorry, boss
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Thanks. May I sit down?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
I beg your pardon.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
It's all right. Bring him in.
Are the cars ready?
Get out of here.
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?
Yes - the worm!
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
The name is Smythe.
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
What?
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
And they won't be able to tell?
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Hello Bill.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Bud?
Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
Um ... It's ...
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
What?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
She won't go out with me?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
"Changes."
No. What?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Rain.
Yes I did.
It was accessible to everyone.
Very well ...
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Well, I never had to do it before.
What?
What is it?
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Green.
What are you doing?
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Jen please ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Well if I don't who will?
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Really? It seems so fattening.
It's fine.
Sure.
Nothing.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Yes.
How come I'm still in black and white?
What?
I told you. I'm like positive.
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
What's that like?
Hunh?
Real rain?
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
McGinty's.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
What the hell's going on!
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
... Hi.
Well c'mere, young fella.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Excuse me?
NOW!
I had nothing to do with that.
Why?
Why?
Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
Oh.
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
I'll never be able to do that.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah but what are you doing?
So you can't talk to me?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
D&D Mattress Man.
Hello.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Did I say that?
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Yeah I can't.
Why?
I have work, I can't leave.
I'm sorry.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
I have no idea.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
I....please don't do this.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
Nothing.
Really?
You have a girlfriend?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Yes.
Me?
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I need help.
I know I did. But I don't.
No you won't.
It was cool last night.
Do you know them.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
I saw a picture of you.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Sure.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
So that was your pudding?
Yes.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
...yes I did...?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
...yeah...
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
I don't know.
This is Lena.
Hi.
So what do I do then?
Ok.
Yeah?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
This is nice.
For what?
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
For what?
Ok.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Your hand is bleeding.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your Social Security number.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
That's that.
I didn't know you had a sister?
....I have seven.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
It's alright.
Like a psychiatrist?
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
So what should I do with the pudding?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
I need to talk to you for a second.
You gotta give me some money.
Is this where you live?
Yes.
What is this, man?
What are you doing?
Yes I am.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
What time are you gonna be there?
I know.
I know.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
What did you say?
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
You ready?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
Don't be so sure.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
They can't be serious.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
His rug.
Valcour. His chair.
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
A man after my own heart...
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
Go to hell!
Of course.
It's a formality; truly.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Well...?
Yes?
Shut down?
You're a sentimental man.
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
And --?
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
What could cause a tincture like this?
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
How is the patient faring?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Enough!
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Quite.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
Most assuredly.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
I don't believe it!
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
I wonder sometimes.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
I can't
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Randolph!
Uh-hub.
Yeah
One . . . buys things.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
This picture--
Not for me.
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
We're using-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Uh-huh
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
Right-
But with compassion and insight--
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
Who the hell's Manolete?
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Mank-
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Sorry to disappoint.
Listen to me-
Fuck you--
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
It doesn't have to be
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
How?
She was . . . innocent
The title?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Craig is one syllable
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Uh huh.
I'm sorry.
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Yeah, you're probably right.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
Get out
Again
Jesus
Please don't ask me to do this.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
They've all seen a rough cut
Then find another theater
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
For Christ's sake, shut up--
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
It was a -joke, George
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Happy birthday.
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
For what?
I'm Ok.
Ok, champ.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Hit me in the face.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Here's your glove.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Huh?
With her? How?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
When?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Well, I heard some things.
I did keep an eye...
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What do you mean, "you"?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
You sound bitter.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
It feels real good.
Can you see it?
What does that mean?
Come over here.
Come here.
Who asked you?
I was just...
Who asked you?
Yeah, what?
What did I do?
I called. You weren't there.
"Father of the Bride."
I am answering...
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I'm leaving you Jake.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
But they don't have a case against you.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
What friends?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Never felt better.
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
For instance?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
-- until yesterday morning.
Who left -- where?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
Mrs. Thorwald.
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
You figured that out, huh?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Your Lisa?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Like an old hambone?
For what?
Wrong day?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
I don't know what you mean.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Tell her to bring it back!
Well, I only quote from the best.
How?
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
I don't want to.
No.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
That's the hard part.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
She pay you much?
Depends one which one.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
He and his wife splitting up?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Huh?
There's something buried there.
What?
Would four of them -- ?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
There's probably one in the basement.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
Mrs. Doyle?
Goodnight, you idiot.
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Yes.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
You mean "goodnight."
Nothing, thank heaven.
Now, Lisa --
What is it you're looking for?
What are you getting at?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Still -- those witnesses.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Is he cleaning house?
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
Too close.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Your name?
Phone number?
Two minutes.
Friend of yours?
They always live.
Give me some dirt.
What?
What?
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
Somebody find him a knife.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Smashed the front door.
I think I should go home.
No.
Hold it, Jim.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Yeah!
And you dropped it?
That's funny!
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Well--
What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
That's right!
Are you going down there?
Plato.
Hi there.
You remember me?
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
He has a knife.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Who knows.  Plato?
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
What?
There's only one key.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Not lately.
When was that?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
No.  At dawn.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
I need it.
They like you.  Okay?
Just a guard.
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
What's that got to do with it?
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
If he could--
Bully for you.
Where what was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Who lives?
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
It doesn't matter to them.
No--I was just--maybe--
I'm numb.
No.
Why?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Well--we're newlyweds.
There's just one thing.  What about--
I bet you hear everything I say!
I don't know.
Hi.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
They're killing him!
Okay.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Do you think your father means that?
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
You said you'd call my father.
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
I didn't want to stop.
Gabriel -- !
Must have a way with stationery.
A man of some travels.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
-- till he fucked his parole --
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Radio said.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No, c'mon --
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Tell me again.
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Nick...
What the fuck is going on.
Nick, I love you --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
...maybe I die for Nick...
No!
He working for them on this one?
They're truck drivers.
Get your own room.
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
We'll need one.
They all are. Football's on.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Yeah. That's love.
I'm glad it was me.
No --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
The hell I can't.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What'd they call her in high school?
Bam Bam.
Hey.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
I said, who the hell made the map?
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Get out.
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
No way.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Show's over.
What... Powwow...
OPEN IT!!!
GO!!!
Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
Five years. Since it opened.
Hi, Nick.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Merlin, I didn't know --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Haven't thought about it.
Hell you haven't.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
And some pecan pie.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
I'm just saying.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Thought you hate your old man.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Good for you. Protein.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
I... sorry, Mister...
But... I had a five...
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Who the hell made this map.
They changed the layout.
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
Elois?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
How do you know all this?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
The Brewers.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
It's a change.
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
You gonna put it away?
Sorry, it's my book now.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Mr. Pink.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
We think we got a rat in the house.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
Nice Guy Eddie.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
It's not good...
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
You don't believe in tipping?
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
I'm cool.
Why not?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
Nope.
Where?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
He asked.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Maybe he did.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Look of things, she doesn't.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
And one of 'em is sick.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
You can't leave us here.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
But you eat, don't you?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
They're stragglin'.
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
But the rest is right.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
That's fine.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
Why do you think?
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Why?
I haven't got the job yet.
Which ranch?
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
No they won't.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Swimming.
Good thing you didn't.
There's only two of them now.
You better start.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Three men on matched roans?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
All right, you didn't know.
I don't care.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
That's a good girl.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Go ahead.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
How many ways can a man say no.
Because there's a man I want to see.
I sure would.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
No.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
But you're his brother.
Let me do that.
Thanks, Steve.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Never happened!
Would you die already?!
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hey, I have an idea...
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
No. I never date outside my race.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Open chest!!!
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
No. Keep rubbing.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
I don't care. You pick.
Hot dogs.
That means more screen time for us.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Right behind you.
We have to destroy him.
I'll go.
No, my friends are right here!
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
Oh.
Are you?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I wouldn't go that far.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Saw who?!
Are these all the subjects?
Any of them hot?
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
How are we going to get them all up there?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Right. What about condoms?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
That's why we came here, remember?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
That's right.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Yours, or the turkeys?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
It's okay. I understand.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Because she will lie?
What she said about your mother?
No, I'm fine.
Dog, you look hot.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Ray!"
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Don't worry, I got your back.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
0h, shit!
Is MOM... in there?
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
She sure can pick 'em!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
No woman would!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Don't I get a kiss?
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I love that you're my wife.
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
I know Dottie!
I certainly did.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
So you admit you just lied?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Yes, but I lent it...
You forgot something...
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Which room is it?
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
No.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
What sort of danger?
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
She can only use cash.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
But I like teaching school.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I ought to know.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No. She asked about the trademark.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you do believe me?
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
But I'm not joking.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
I don't know.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
You will die.
Yes.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it  to know me better.
I have to go -
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
You know where she is?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
No. She's no longer under my care.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
I'm afraid not.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Thank you, my dear.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
Yes?
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
What did he say?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
Graham Dalton.
Television?
Yes.
Curious.
No, I think you look... fine.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
You play an instrument?
Well... well, the clich about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
What's the first?
No.
Impotent.
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Ann. Hello.
Videotapes.
I can see that. What are they?
Donna?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Not really.
No.
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
This is just... so...
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Yes.
Yes.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
On tape?
You said you weren't always impotent.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Don't you get lonely?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
I'm babbling.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
That's very flattering.
But I don't understand --
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But you're planning to be?
I don't know. Possibly.
But that was part of it?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Why don't I believe you?
Always the lawyer.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I know.
I want out of this marriage.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
You bitch. I knew it.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Did you masturbate?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
What visitor?
Did you find him attractive?
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Well, I wonder why.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.
Questions about sex.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
No, but I did.
You couldn't do it, period.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
You are in serious trouble.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
I don't want to discuss it.
Did you take your clothes off?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
You just want to ask me questions?
And that's all?
Yes.
Would anybody else see the tape?
How do we start?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Very much live.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Why?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Afraid of getting caught?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I don't think my sister would agree.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
You trust him.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Who?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Really. How'd it go?
What do you mean?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
No.
No.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Shut up!!!
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
All right, jesus.
Was he nice to you?
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
He sounded fine.
No. Dotty's the last.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
No. I don't think so.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
I don't get it.
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
What?
You got it!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
Home?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Why Janet?
So it seems.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
I'd forgotten.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
It's...
Vance!  Vance Parker.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Farley!
F for...
Fast!
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
We love you, Baby.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
It'll just take a second.
Good. That's good.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I love you.
Bye.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.
Gary.
My condolences.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
I'm good.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
That's what people say.
Oh yeah.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
You said you had it all lined up.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
I'm working on it.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
What color is it supposed to be?
Huh.
Now.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Whoa.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
You know that chick?
She is very hot.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
She works for tips!
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You have the keys.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Nah. I want to watch this.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
I will.  See ya!
What?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Nope.
Shut up.
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Let me use your phone.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
That's thoughtful.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Uh-huh.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
No way. No way.
Please, Miles, please.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Me?
Hrnrnrn?
Quite a week.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Whatever. Sorry.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Good for you.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Hey.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Yeah. Thanks.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Sure.
Yeah.
Got it.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
About two-thirty.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Yeah.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Miles?
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Yeah.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
French or American?
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
He had to make a phone call.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
No.
She doesn't answer me either.
It tastes funny.
You love walks.
Clear for what?
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
No I'm not.
Yes it was.
Yes, it was.
Yes.
Ray Reddy's house.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
How do they know it's over?
Don't.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
You're scaring your sister.
The footprints.
Sounds like a virus.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
I would say so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Don't worry.
What book!
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
No money, eh?
Sounds good.
That's it.
Right.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Goodbye?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
My name is Emmett.
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
Where's Turley?
Yeah, maybe a bath.
He is that.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
I understand.
It's not going to be easy.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
No hard feelings.
What about the law?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
And a pretty lady.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
The other guy drew first.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
Howdy.
That ain't right.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
I just got to town.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
So-called?
Who's the owner?
He left me.
What do you mean?
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Of course.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I'm not --  He's not.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
I'm glad we talked.
Good-bye.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
If it's on the page...
Even the fall from the plane.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Everyone you know is lying.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
Really?
No.
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
I do?
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
When is she coming over?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Yes, call me Simone.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
How about the nudity?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Absolutely not!
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Somebody said she was here.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
Don't be.  It was worth it.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- Flesh is weak.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
"Straw God" changed my life.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
This week anyhow.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Is she here tonight?
She can't watch herself.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
I read.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I love you too, daddy.
She did... didn't she?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I know.  Thank her for me.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
What?!
This is the story.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
Maybe he's talking to himself.
My God, you've got one?
Long live the First Amendment.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
I don't understand.
You're in breach.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
No, just one.
I guess they don't.
Why?
Know what?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
What kind of words?
Dr. Crowe.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
What?
I don't know, Cole.
When?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Yes, I am.
And you know what else?
Don't get mad.
So who moved it?
Someone got hurt.
Standing next to my window.
They?
Dead people.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
They used to hang people here.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
It's our pleasure.
Chuck E. who?
How'd he know I'd come?
Meaning?
What are you talking about?
What's a "little while?"
Two.. maybe three days.
Bitch.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Book of Jeremiah.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Manure... is life.
Metaphysical question, man.
Hi Suze.
Harvest moonshining!
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Pardon?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I'll be fine here.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
People say he was a murderer.
-- It's not me!
I --
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
The audience!
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Look. You want to talk about this?
What are --
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Never.
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Why bother?
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
And that makes you look like a squid?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Just checking out the lights.
Hey, Grant.
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Aspirin.
Okay.
It's my nature.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Don't worry, Chief.
What?
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
My present?
You're my princess, aren't you?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
Hey, look!
If...?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
But you could get killed, right?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
You have a great profile.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Eleven.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You could've asked.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
Weight Station.
That man is your father?!?
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
That's me.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
How'd you know?
Go.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
This is Bandit I, come back.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Not for long, you ain't.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
We're outta motion lotion.
We'll be waiting. Over.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
You're coming up to the scale house.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
About one to five years worth.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
That's correct.
-- so you shut them off?
You have a butler working that floor?
Is your security team armed?
And who has access to that floor?
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
No.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
You think so?
Yeah, why.
...About what?
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
Without peer?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
I thought Heller was a double op?
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
-- You can and you will.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
I don't see it like that at all.
You got clicks, anything?
-- okay, g'head --
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
A million flat.
Yeah... Sid?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
It's gettin' done Sid.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
True?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
What?
...What are they doin' right now...?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
What's the time frame?
What do you want?
Her?  Who are you talking about?
Listen --
No, she won't.
He's dead.
I wish you'd told me.
Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Perhaps it did.
Human beings can die.
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Get out --
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Yes.
Into what?
Yes.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
To calm your anxiety.
Better.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
Then it's God, right?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
You don't know?
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Was she right?
But that's what happened before.
If you're here.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
Neither did I.
When?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Right.  That's true.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Beg pardon?
Not too sure about that.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
Could be, I guess.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
And "is"...?
Tell it like it is.
Claire, will you calm down?
I do care about you!
They called here after you left...
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
You don't have to, now.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Not if you don't want me to.
Just putting in an appearance then.
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
I don't know Tommy.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
What are you talking about?
I can still use a gun.
Why?
I'd identify him.
What did she say the down payment was?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
She bought it.
I'll be right up.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
What was that?
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
I just sat and listened.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
I heard.
No, I need'm now!
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
... Hard?
No, I will not step outside.
You should'a brought the girl.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
I know where everything is.
Lay back, Mack.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
We're gonna pass the street.
I don't think she can sing, either.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
What, want a glass?
No. No, that's okay.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Harry
I know.  I've got one too.
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Right.
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
Mr. Jameson--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
What's this? A cockaroach?
How about tomorrow?
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
How very dull, Peter Parker.
It's too early to be clever.
But you like that in a man?
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
You'd feel what?
So you've found Thorkel?
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
You sure about all this?
Any sign of our friend?
I'll introduce you.
I'm a photographer, remember?
No.
It'll shut itself off.
Aunt May, what happened?
How is he?
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Actually, I got this spider bite
How much do you know about it?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Like it?
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Imagine how I feel.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Bonkers.
We did not.
Jawohl!
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You stink, Sefton!
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Thanks.
No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
We're looking at it.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Don't wear it out!
They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
What some brandy?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
Let's!
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
It's a mouse trap.
And this?
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
So what? There's other women!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
What do they always say?
Animal! Got a little something for you!
I'll open mine, too.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Yes, sir.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Good.
Any objections, men?
Why the south latrine?
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
We did it.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
You can tell Father Murray to --
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Can you project its course?
I believe so.
Commander.
Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
Really? What do you feel?
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
You're in the Nexus.
It's our pleasure.
It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
That's right.
You could say that.
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Where are the deflector relays?
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Understood. That will be all.
No. Thank you.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Execute!
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
What did you see, Chekov?
Locate.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
Not from here, no.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Short range scan.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
... Or <u>who</u>.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Why?
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'll go...
You said there wouldn't be any.
Do you have an explanation?
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Aye, sir!
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
What? What are you saying?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Much is at stake...
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
What about surface life signs...?
Go, Sulu!
Indisposed, sir.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
May I ask why...?
Torpedoes coming in -- !
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
Yes, I was...
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Then, how --
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
He asked you not to grieve...
... Or the one.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What I have done, I had to do.
Understood, my lord.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.

Sir, may I --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
How is that...?
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Say thank you.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Ah.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
I have my orders.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Maybe...
You know what she'll say...
I can hardly see --
What's the matter -- ?
What do you want with us? I demand --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
We appear to have plenty of time.
He's on a build up to detonation!
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Are you running away from me?
I am truly sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Don't you believe it.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
No!
Inoperative.
I shall avenge you --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Aye, sir --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Scotty, let's have it.
Aye, sir.
Not at present.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
It's all we've got.
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
A distinct possibility.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Scotty, can we make it inside?
Spock...!
In my quarters, Uhura.
And why not?
Because... there was no way to win.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Who?
HURRY.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
Phasers on stun. Move out.
Erased...
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
Engine room! What's happening?!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Visual.
Phasers locked...
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
Where must you go?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
... They do, indeed.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Please...
What do you mean?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
-- That's the general idea.
That's crazy!
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
We're just -- observing.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
The top of what?
No, <u>my</u> name.
I do not know your name.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
How soon?
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
I'm all ears.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Kirk. They're gone.
... Damn!
A spaceship with a missing man.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
You've programmed that from memory...?
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
... Simple logic.
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
For example?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Why not?
The hell I can't
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Then... Where the hell are we?
Steady as she goes...
... Aye sir...?
Picture, Uhura!
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Mercy Hospital.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
Full power, sir.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
The explosive override -- ?
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Millions?
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
The keyboard... How quaint.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
This way!
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I understand.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Really.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
No, I mean...
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
I don't know.
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
It is over.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
Are they...?
Do you know how they were damaged?
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
The purpose being...?
If it works you mean.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
We're not going anywhere.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Transferring controls to manual.
Gorch?
We have to find shelter...
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
You're in quite a mood today.
... I'm not sleeping well...
Absolutely.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
I look forward to reading your report.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
More lies.
No.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Can you configure it?
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
But how?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
I'm on it...
Active.
Yes.
California. San Francisco.
There's a few of us left.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
We?
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Aye, sir.
Fire.
Steady as she goes.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Go to manual.
Fire!
We're still in Earth orbit.
Life signs?
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
Yes, sir.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
What kind of message?
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Then let me help!
Retire.
Barely.
They'll make it look like an accident...
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
The drink WAS served...
I am.
I know what you mean...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
ALL uniforms?
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
Onscreen.
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
Thank you, Captain.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to it.
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Not me, idiot - HIM!
He's got it.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Where do we come in?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Aye, sir.
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Sir?
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
When does this conference start?
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
LET THEM DIE.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
So, that's it..
Spock, you want to know something?
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
A lie?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Confirmed, Captain!
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
I believe I am.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. Can I move now?
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
You're working late.
Not tonight, I have work here.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
Now, you make a toast.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
Sorry, sir.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Do you have a name, sir?
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Emergency force fields are holding.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
With pleasure, Captain.
I don't know.
I know how he thinks.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
Do you have life support?
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Sir?
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
Ready, sir!
That's an order, Commander.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Not with the Romulans.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
What sort of signature?
On screen.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
It's working.
Counselor?
We can only hope so.
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
I've never met a human woman.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
You know I do.
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
I have no reason to.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
In time.
Why am I here?
I was lonely...
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
And what of the Enterprise?
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Not so long.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I am.
On my way.
He's a very unusual android.
Should I raise shields?
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
We're being hailed.
Let's go.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Do as I tell you!
You heard me.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
For the moment.
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
Probably kids.
How much are your rooms?
I'll take that.
I make maps.
They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
He's got a gun!!
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I don't like it, George...
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
No, we don't.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Watch it. They're coming out.
What.
Ah no.
What.
Pancakes.
No gas.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Closed?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit... shit... what shit?
No.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
Yes.
It was yellow.
How will I do this one?...
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Three nights... two days.
No.
Why?
What is hitchhike?
The driver will...
Yes.
Can I have the gun?
No.
Goodbye.
Yes?
Yes?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
He will.
I am your friend.
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
I do not want to.
You can have one.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
I don't want you to be hurt.
No one's traveling in this weather.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Horses.
Do they talk?!
I want to get money for you and the baby.
The cook again?
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
We can.
Yes.
Many, many days and nights...
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Slow down, slow down.
I don't know where he is.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
To the same woman?
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Just not the eyes.
What's all this squid shit?
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
My God.
Tonight.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Maybe.
Damn right.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
We should talk alone.
Clips.
What?  Right Here?
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
You should feel like shit.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
So've I.  Too much.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Jesus!
Naawww.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
What?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Your sex life?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Sleaze to peddle.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
Coming with you.
You will not live to see the morning.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
In LA?  Are you crazy?
Get it.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Black.  Jack.
So that gives you something.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Sure.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
How long does it last?  Oh.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
I'm not going.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
I guess.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Yeah.  We did.
Are you going to make me beg?
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Testa?
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
No, sir.
You're thinking...?
Who knows.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
What does the Manager say?
Let's take a look.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Not as much as you'd think.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
What?
What's wrong with me?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Put a BOLO out on that.
What about his killer?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
MyDick.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
I was visiting an old college friend.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I was looking for a pattern.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
How long have you been downtown?
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
Where's my watch? It's gone.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
The other reason?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
This is some serious shit.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
He thinks he looks young.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
We did find these, however.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
I just need to go a little slow.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
Start killing people for real?
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He's moved on to TV.
Who told you about her?
If I owe, I will go.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
[You tell me.]
So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
Koessler?
I talked to him.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
I know, I know.
You're right. I know.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
What kind of car do you drive?
Oh... a Cavalier.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
What's that like?
Are you sure? Maybe...
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
Not lately.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...you might get cut out.
What else is going on?
...Four days..?
No matter what... like splitting aces.
...And she's with someone else.
He is so sweet.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
I'm a comedian.
You want this in black chips.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Listen. I had a great time.
I'll be around.
It's not going to well?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...It's really getting late.
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
...get the hell outta here already...
I can call back...
No, no. Hold on.
How are you doing?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
Why didn't you call?
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Right.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
It's definitely a step back for me.
I didn't want to say anything.
Why?
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Kinda.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
There's the rub.
...yeah, a month ago.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh, like that song...
I got to at least try once.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
You always know the right thing to say.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
She's really special, guys.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Don't call me ever again.
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
I don't know...
I'm not going to Vegas.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas!
Whu?
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yea, how much?
Let's go.
Who's the big winner?
What an asshole.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Did she, or did she not smile.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I know she's coming back.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
...gotta...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Baby, you did fine.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Hold on.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Sorry about interrupting...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
No, baby. You're money.
She didn't like me, anyway.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
I just need some time...
...a day...
Selling scrap metal.
He drives a carriage.
What?!?
I hear she's getting real fat.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
...It looked money.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
That doesn't matter.
We're not messing with you...
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
...double diamond...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
You're money.
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it's definitely on.
...it is so on.
...Definitely...
...just be smart about it.
I'll be back with the coffee.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Yes. 
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
But your daughter is still alive.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
You have to answer for Santino.
Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
Like hell I will.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
How bad will it be?
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
When did he call?
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
Yes.
Now you've had your drink.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For bravery.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I'm going to finish school.
You wanted me to be your son.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How did you find out?
How?
You want him to stay in this country.
Where are you going?
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
What is it?
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Mike!
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
They're talking to themselves.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
You really want to know?
You like spaghetti?
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
And what do you want for Christmas?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
Please say it.
Don't you want dinner first?
I'm busy.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Tell me!
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
Is it true?
How can you be sure?
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
And all his works?
I do wish to be baptized.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
He talked to you?
You're unlucky.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Do you recognize my voice?
Sure. Any time.
Is that good?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Did you speak to my father?
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Oh, it was.
That's funny.
No, still here.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
What?
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Well we certainly know that's true.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
No!
I didn't mean with you in it.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
That's good.
Ha.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
How?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Aye, aye.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Yes it is.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
What does that mean?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
I think you're right.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Marge, when did you get here?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie did it.
Dickie?
And you, sir? Any better?
I can explain.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
How would you know that?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
I hope so.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
I think we sort of found each other.
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Emily.  Just kidding.
As in the...?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Right.
How did you know that?
I'll take them both.
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You know what -- I am.
Where have you been since then?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
And tomorrow?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
He says so many fiances.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
I'll fix some drinks.
It's okay.
I give up.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Was who Meredith?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
You want to canvass?
Well, we're all working tonight.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
What kind of people?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
The moon?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
It keeps ya busy.
What?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I bought a couple of tickets.
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
I mean porno movies.
Keep it.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
You forgot "sexy".
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Just what?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
Show me how he did that again.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
That's a dollar forty-seven.
The kind with a brush.
Could you see anything?
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
A real skunk.
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
A girl needs protection.
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
That's a nice name.
That's what you think.
No.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Can I see you again?
That's not hard to do.
Where is home?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Have you tried the telephone?
Why, thank you Travis.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Twenty-six.
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
You would, huh?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Show it to me.
It happens.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Thanks.
You know how I feel about what you do.
Don't let him do that.
Well yes I suppose ...
Wrong.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
It's about time.
The cell, Mason.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
You knew?  All this time?
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
That always used to work.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
It's possible.
Me too.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
I did?  Huh!
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Oh.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
That's... pretty frightening.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Yes.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Yes it does.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
No, sir.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
A statement?
Go ahead, son.
Well, son, you're home!
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
But what?
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
Good to meet you.  Again.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
Harry, son.  Harry.
Can't wait.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
Yes?
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Anybody take it?
Vultures...
Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
What.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Sandra Sinclair.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Thanks.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
What's his rent?
I... I don't believe this.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
You should watch what you say.
Exactly.
You can't testify.
So, it is a blacklist.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Not at all.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What do you mean?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
I taught you that.
Some of it might come back to you.
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
No.
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Oh.
Oh...
I thought you...
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
It's a lovely garden.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Thank you.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
A trifle.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
And what had you done?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Because she was afraid.
I don't understand.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
That's up to you.
Yes.
If your father were here...
They're birds!
Yes?
Could I have a puff?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Why are they trying to kill people?
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
The little Brenner girl.
I wonder if you could help me.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
What name?
Yes.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
It's nothing.
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
We'll make our own fog.
They're back!
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
Yes.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Yes, Mother.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
I don't know.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Cathy. At the school.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you like me to go for her?
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Are they moulting now?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
How?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Criminal.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Why... 
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Oh, no you don't!
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Maybe.
Famished.
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Oh, yes.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Oh. That. Rome.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Without any clothes on?
Yes, but...
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
But you tore it up.
Like what?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Yes.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
I'm glad you do.
Yes.
I think I should, don't you?
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Take wing!
What do you mean?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
You must be exhausted.
How about you?
Wait here. Don't move.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
Well, all right, but...
I have no idea.
Yes, certainly. 
Do you have any lovebirds?
How soon?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
How?
We need them.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
Then let's go. Now!
Can't you please finish your drink?
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
Of course I will.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
I've heard of it.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
I remember her.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
But you did promise.
Yes, I suppose so.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Not yet.
Why, yes.
I can't.
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
I'll not do it, Gray.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I have other means of sustenance.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
I would make you rich.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Three years.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
No great lady will ever take my place?
You can get out.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
We won't.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
I think we should get some support?
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
The scar.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Your father gave them to both of you.
Someone else did it.
No! Why are you haunting me?
No...
Yes I do, I really do.
So you're going to kill him?
I know.
You know.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Just hold on to me.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
Would you care to be more specific?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
That's what I came to see you about.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Maybe a little demonstration.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Professor Barnhardt.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Okay.
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
You're just kidding, aren't you?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Goodnight.
I'll say goodnight again.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
Looks real to me.
How do you know?
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
It won't work.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I was.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
I'm sorry.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
I'd give you a very good price.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
No -- I'm afraid not.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
Fine!  Stay here!
Two down and two to go.
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Where's Star, David?!
With him?
No.  Stick around.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
I will, David!
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
I can't do that!
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
There's a cop behind us.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
I thought we were goin' into town.
For everything.
Mom... please.
Gotta go, Mom.
What's that smell?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
He doesn't walk all over me.
I hope so.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
No.
No.  On the phone.
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
The Marines.
Huh?...
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Maybe.
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Watch Clark.
What?
Ain't it there?
Don't walk behind me.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
You buy any of this, Blair?
How the fuck do I know?!
Garry's missing!
What clothes?
What for?
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Then we'll never make it.
All in Norwegian.
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
A day or so ago... I guess.
How far's that?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Damn if I won't.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
And that was enough?
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
Who else could have used that key?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
1899.
Can you show us where they live?
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
Excuse me?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
What?
Yes...
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
This way.
Vox...
I won't leave you like this.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I don't understand.
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
I'll never forget this.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Alexander.
How do you control the Morlocks?
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Trust me...
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
All right, what is it now?
I mean... well... affection.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Dance with me...
Holding you... again.
All right...
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
I've seen it.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
God, and I'm running late --
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Then why are you here?
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
You wouldn't believe me.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
Sir...?
Yes...
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Mm.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Then you can speak slowly.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
You can see so many here.
Good night.
Yes!
We share everything.
Thank you.
I can see Kalen's point.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Orion's belt...
Yes.
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Here?
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
New Yorkers.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
What about Starks?
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Depends on what you're seeing.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
My business?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
I don't understand...
He didn't either.
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
That's too bad.
I never touched your father! I swear!
Sure.
[Beat] Thank you.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Yeah.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
Well, you belong in one.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
[Beat] What?
Yeah.
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I know.
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
They're not.
There're no cars on this street.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
I'm doing fine.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
Why?
You thought my father was crazy?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
[Beat] I don't know.
Because I don't have time.
How...how do you know?
I did?
Yeah.
You still don't believe me, do you?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
[Beat] How do you know?
Is it true?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I don't think so.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Sure.
[Beat] I do it.
You remember it?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Uh-huh.
What?!
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
On what?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You girls are in some hot water.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
I have no problem with that.
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
What's wrong?
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Who's your friend?
Christ, sure... yes!
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Who did it?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
In the back?
What kind of stuff do I bring?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Isn't this fun?
Yeah!
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Get the car!
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Why are you actin' like this?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Louise.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
Have another drink, Thelma.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
You left that guy alone in the room?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Why not?!
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
You're right.
Before.
Like a Chihuahua?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Thelma!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
About how fast was I going?
Shoot the radio!
I believe you.
Just asking.
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
Are you alright?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
Whatever.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Me too.  I feel awake.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
What?
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
Way up ahead!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Fresno.
Yeah... sure did.
So you admit it?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Well... at least now you know.
Amen to that.
What?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
I don't know what to say.
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
You know, clean the pipes.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.
You got a brew?
Big time.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Thanks.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
I beg your pardon?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Great.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
How about -- ?
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Well, I'll see ya.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Sure.
All you want is a phone number?
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Four kids, three different guys.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Answer the question, shitball.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
Bullshit!
And you met Mary how?
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I never said that.
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
That must make it tough.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
What's a mook?
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Oh Jesus...
Oh, are you on the team?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
On your ear, you've got something.
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
You forgot your keys!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
It.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Is that bubble what I think it is?
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
Bye, Ted.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
Yes.
Where the hell are you?
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
What if I can't?
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
Then they should speak up.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
What's happened?
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
Dean Rusk!
Back to work.
Damn right I'm scared.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
You're sure...
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Again. Figures, man.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
Goodbye.
Seven.
No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Go ahead.
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
She's that subtle?
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Why?
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
And...
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Not no more.
What are you talking about?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
So they took care of Leo.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
That's right. Turn around.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
I desecrated it?
Good.
Mister Tully.
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Get up!
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
And on to a bigger one with you?
I'm with someone.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
On his six.
It is combat. Every second counts.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
The what?
Uh hum.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Make what?
You're an animal.
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
It's not suffering anymore.
You don't have to kill it.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
Where?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
I don't know yet.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
I'm fine.
Not to me.
You don't have to do this.
I want it back.
Yesterday.
Hardly ever.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Your watch.
I know exactly what you mean.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Right on the flight line?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
He's pissing me off!
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
What?  What is it?
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Okay.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Why do they call you Wolf?
Like what?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
The list is long, but distinguished.
Tom Kazansky.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Come on. I died enough for one night.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
SHIT!!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
IT'S MY SHOT.
LOOK OUT!
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
No. You can be mine!
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
Me?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
Then why are you here?
I know. I was there.
I never heard that.
Not something they tell dependents.
It's not true.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
The Last Resort.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Why not?
And you get a kickback.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Would you like the same suite?
Get it, please.
Thank you.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
Yes, sir.
You better get down here.
Hetero.
At Rekall.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Not since you lost him.
Where?
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
What, aliens?
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Melina!
They sell fake memories.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Let me buy you a drink.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Do what?
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Oh God, Doug.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
They did!  But I killed them!
Doug...
I'm not your wife.
I'm honored.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Bullshit.
Right.  Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
As real as any memory in your head.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Let me go!
I think it's still hungry.
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
Hauser left me a note.
Not any more.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Don't be ridiculous.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Get out!
What reactor?!
Aliens built it.
I gave you?
...Who are you?
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
I think I scared it!
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
No.  We go straight.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Adios, bridge!
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Great.  Thank you.
<u>Why</u> would they do it?
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Its tires are flat...
We got a plan!
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
It's...gone...!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Okay, ten dollars.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Yeah, geography.
Around here?  Why would they?
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Good point.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
True.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Shut your sewer mouth!
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Not at all --
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
We're taking the other case.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool.  Next exit.
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
-- Eddie...
Christ... Shu is innocent.
...For ten years, now.
Neither.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I haven't paid you.
You don't drink "booze".
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
I don't need sleep!
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
I killed the motherfucker.
But why?
-- About what?
By trusting me. Shit, man...
Y-yes, sir.
No, s-sir.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
That's right.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
-- in a context.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
-- Every word.
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
That's right.
Soldado.
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Blonde.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
NO! GOD, NO...
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Get lost Bobby.
Don't get funny with me again.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Yep, it sure is.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Teresa Banks.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
No, sir, we did not.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Thanks.
Thanks.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Cole said she was 17.
He probably wanted to drive over.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Not you, Donna, not you.
What can I tell you?
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Fill 'er up.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Who would do that?
Bob.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Oh, yes... yes...
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I'm not.
Hey, Jacques...
What? She asked about my father?
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Not now.
This afternoon?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What do you mean?
When he finds out.
Boating?
You'd think so.
You're getting warmer.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Mom, take it easy.
Good night, sweetheart.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
School?
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
A friend from school.
A special friend?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
No.
No.
I was down the street.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Oh, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
I can arrange that. I like that.
Who am I?
I don't know.
As if I didn't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
How did you settle on the amount?
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
No.
That's not my handwriting.
Neurology?
What book is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Objection.
You may step down.
Yes.
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Yes.
When she...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
That's right.
And what did your team do...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Tell us.
...that's all right.
Hold on a second.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
There's nothing they can do to me.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Well...
I... um...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
'Code Blue'...
Yes.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
...and you're going to do that?
I'm sorry...?
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
One hour.
Why is that?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I'm sure you would.
Thank you for seeing me.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
No, no, I'm just...
You're going to stay here...?
Isn't there something you...
Well, then what are you doing here?
I...
Not if you don't grow up...
Yes.  We've all got to let go.
What are you going to do?
Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Let me talk to Mickey.
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Yes. Price...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I've got nothing to say to you.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's locked.
...You saw her?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...I understand...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
Yes.
He's not in, Sir.
That's for sure, Frank.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
What difference can that make...? All right...
I don't want a mistrial.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes, the roving nurse...
Yes.
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.  We'll clear the area all around.  After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
Can you handle one of these?
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
How'd you guess?
Have you got a pocket compass?
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
D.O. to number three..come in.
How would I know...!
The nightmares.
And I...I've got other things happening.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
Hasn't been another call, has there?
No, you don't.
Just be careful, okay?
Chase. Hi...
Chase, it's Dylan!
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Like Freddy.
Diabetes?
No...
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Is he all right?
Oh my God...
These look quite fresh.
Everything is not fine!
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
Bye.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
This is going to give you nightmares.
I like this story.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Right 'cross the freeway.
I'm fine.
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
Seemed, not was.
Steady...
You got it.  What's happening?
Fred Krueger did it.
Yes?
Listen, dammit.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Then what is he doing?
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
No, not really.  I...
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Coffee'd be nice.
Yep.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Thank you.
Okay.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Gieg, Chuck.
Whatever.
What do you mean?
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
Believe what?
What about you?
I know.
I just can't believe it.
He does.
Like this!
What's the difference?
I guess.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
We all have problems.
I just brought you something to eat.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
Do what?
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
My dad.
I couldn't.
I can't make it out?
What are you talking about.
Yes sir.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
But you invited is aboard.
I can take care of myself.
It has nothing to do with him.
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
You're officer of the watch, George.
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
What's that?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
What's that?
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Trust me donut.  I know.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
I don't have to listen to this.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
About anything.
Long enough.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Son of a bitch!!
Sir.
No.
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
Up you go.  Right now.
I'm sorry...
No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
I can't be sure.
For killing a dolphin.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
What's that supposed to mean?!
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
Why? He's right in the groove.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
Well... Yeah - okay.
Sorry to hear it.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
You heard from Reggie?
What'd you say?
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
You hitched yet?
No sir...
Whattaya do there?
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
That bastard Pucinski...
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
And?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Stab it and steer.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
I guess.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Come look at this.
What's that, honey?
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
You certain?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
Who do?
I'm goin'.
Who knows, baby?
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
They have, sugar.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
There's worse places, honey.
If you say so.
You think she's gonna make it?
Fan works.
Yeah?
Come sit by me.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
You talk to 'im some?...
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Oughta make 'em happy.
Let's leave here.
I mean tomorrow.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
What makes sense, is all.
Damn!
The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles...
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Just a place.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
What if I asked you not to?
What if I told you not to?
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Get rid of him?
Just tell me what you want.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Life is unpredictable.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I thought you were tinkering.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
He finished it Winter Break.
He lives with his mother.
Back up. Go out the other way.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
...we find the jacket.
No wonder he screwed us over.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
He was never able to reproduce them.
I peeked.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Bullshit.
You did.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
The last month maybe.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
You're in Kinship?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
With Emily?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Yea?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Sounds like a good one.
It's not bad.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Really?
Yea, James.
You?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
You're welcome.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Sure.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
That's a big book you're writing.
Hm.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Maybe...
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Outside Scranton.
I never heard of it.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Jealous? Of me?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
No thanks.
When?
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
James'll know about George Sanders.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
I'm pregnant.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Caps.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
You heard? How?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
All right.
Inside.
Would Walter really press charges?
I said it didn't sound like you.
I'm through improvising.
Some times...
Does he still love you?
It didn't come up.
I know, but sometimes...
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
What's that?
It's Grady, Walter.
Sick.
Taking the long way home.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
A jockey? You mean, like --
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Foreman now.
No shit.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
Something wrong with that?
I like the noise.
What?
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
How old is Anna?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
There's a million birds here.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
Why not?
It's hard to describe.
You live around here?
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
I have friends.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
I have no idea.
I would.
If you could, you would have brought one today.
Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
I don't know.
That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
The girl.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
Apartment's okay.
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Robin?
Do you like it when he asks you?
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
Your daddy will always love you.
Yes?
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
What?
No way.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
It's okay.
Honest? No.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Forget it.
I don't feel anything.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Then why are you talking about this?
I'm not that crazy.
Why do you think you're here?
I mean, when will I be normal.
I couldn't say.
What is your idea of being normal?
Fuck you, Rosen!
Is this the first one?
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
I said I was sorry.
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
I don't know.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
To relax.
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
How old are you and your sister?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Nothing.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Yes.
I was six years old!
It's fucking freezing out here.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Neither do you.
I like the noise.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
How about in the morning.
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
How young?
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
No. Never again.
Sounds like a special guy.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
What?
Not ever.
Who doesn't?
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
Prove it.
Yeah.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I'm switching off now.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
That must be it.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
What do you think he saw?
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
No.
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not in this thing.
They'll come out after us.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
FUCK LOGIC!!
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
He's hallucinating badly.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
What! After giving us such a run around...
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
As you wish.
Well, what?
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
And how do you explain that?
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Yes, very much so.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Who knows why they all left...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
I'm too sleepy.
Have you ever been in love?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Do you consider that a compliment?
No.
What do you mean by sensible?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
I think it's possible.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
And where do you find the models?
I appeal to you more?
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
And what did they say about me?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
Thank you.
But where did you come from?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
But you have to  consider all possibilities, Sandro.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
You really must do me this one favor.
Through someone else?
Why?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Who told you this?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
I'm not hungry.
They were stained.
Say it!
What do you mean?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Yes.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
I don't know.
Yes.
Who?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
At least once a week.
In the confessional.
Why should they?
I don't know.
And what did you do?
And what happened?
And then what?
What baby?
Where'd it come from before that?
Don't you know?
Would you like to be?
Why not?
Why do you smoke?
What else did she tell you?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
What things?
How did she know that?
No, but I can never tell her that.
She'd get angry.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Why not?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Agnes...
Sometimes, yes.
I'm always bad.
Yes.
How?
She watches... she listens.
Her headaches.
And then...
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Alright.
Yes.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
I'm afraid.
I ate.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Someone's following me.
No.
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Is someone in the room with you?
Frightened.
Yes.
She'd seen him too.
So she sent you?
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Yes.
I don't remember.
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
I don't know.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
How do you survive?
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Uh huh.
What does this have to do with..?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
... Thank you.
I can beat that.
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Why do you think that?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
No... not in the eyes of the police.
Who?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
The Catholic Church...
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
There's another choice.
What?
Answers.
Oh, some time in January.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Earthquakes?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
I'd like yours too.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'd love one.
Hand rolled.
Do you want to become one?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Of course.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For Agnes.
She's been touched by God, yes.
The father!
Don't be ridiculous.
You're saying God did it?
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Somebody told her.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Yes.
For what?  An abortion?
And the baby.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Are you now?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Oh, it's all right.
Read 'em!
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Well!
Sorry? 
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
I'll have a bash.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
No, straight up.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
I'll look in here again.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Aye, I knew you were.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And cunning.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Pity.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
What?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Hello.
Every morning.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Here, Pauly.
For Ringo.
I think you're soft or something.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Don't be callous.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Well you're not going.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Oh you do, look.
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Thanks.
He'll get over it.
You've lost him.
Aren't we ...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Well, he can't stop here.
I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
Kill drive engines.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
What's the terrain down there?
Is it solid?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
I'm on my way.
Sure.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
No, I want to go in.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Unknown.
Has the hull been breached?
Right.  Talk to you.
Yeah!
How's it coming on the engines?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Dead.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Right.
The engines are fixed.
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out.
I hope not.
Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
It wouldn't come.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
I've completely lost their signal.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
How many?
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Feast your eyes.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
You lead.
How far?
Who knows?
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Yes, thank heaven.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
About four hours.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Good!  Moisture content?
Any microorganisms?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
What killed it?
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Good.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Now what?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Kablooey.
I'll get you out of there.
Yeah...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
I told you we... what's that?
Thanks.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Yep...
Better tell the boss.
It's on the board.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Too many.
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
What's our weapons situation?
Not yet.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
Take a look at this.
What?
What?
I'll come with you.
Is it still moving?
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
How many... how many people are missing?
Well... try the headset.
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
What time's sundown?
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
Phoebe?
Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
Please do.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Yes. I do.
Yes. The Shubert.
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Eddie what?
Just some coffee.
Just like that.
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
You know me better than that.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
... and Karen.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
I don't know what I take you for anything...
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Champion to champion.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
That's how you met me. In passing.
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Then you two must have a long talk-
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
Frankly, I don't remember.
How nice.
That's nice.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
I'm a junk yard.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
As of this moment you're six years old...
I get a party, don't I?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
I thought you were going to be late-
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
For instance - you!
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
Okay. Mix.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
Now don't get carried away-
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
I wish it were.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
Hear, hear...
Glory Hallelujah.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
Is it the money?
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
Every day.
Of course not.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
I'm for it.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
- and for you.
You think?
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Buy some.
Of course!
Oh, brother.
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Behind in your dues? How much?
You don't like Eve, do you?
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
I - I guess I fell asleep.
What for?
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
He's the best.
Oh, no. I see the play.
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I'd like that.
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Hollywood.
Karen.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
They'll do as they're told.
I won't forget.
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
But the raves about your performance-
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
Something most important you can do.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
'Remembrance'.
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
It doesn't matter.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
That's on time for Margo.
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
I'm trying hard to follow you.
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
I'm a human being, I've got some!
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
She was a revelation...
What do you mean?
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
Call, what call?
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
Play it again.
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
When's the audition?
Would you?
I promise.
Answer my question!
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--no way--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
And you haven't called him?--
The fucking New York Times.
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
You're not a kid anymore.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
You voted for him.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--shit--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I haven't said anything--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
11:30.
I'm on deadline.
--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
--Teddy Kennedy?
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
Mind if I try?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
But you know who did.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--so?
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
Absolutely--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
It's right under that pile.
FBI too?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
What do you want to know?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
I don't know titles.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--what do you think?--
Electronic surveillance.
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
--I'm not here.
Look, I told you inside--
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
To where?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Haldeman too?
How grand?
Howard Hunt here.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Where?
Where in government?
No.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
I couldn't say.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
Howard--
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
Absolutely.
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
No, it was good.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Sure.
You need some work, buddy!
Single malt?
Neither did I!
Uh-huh.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
That's nice.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
What's that?
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Please.
I think I've had one.
No you haven't.
No.
Do you?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
I do, baby, I do.
Uh...
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
You can crash at Stifler's?
Pontificated.
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
He's going in!
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
I'm not going.
Yeah.
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
It's not what it looks like!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Okay, I get it.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
No -- Kevin, you?
So do I, Kev.
I thought so.
Shame on you!
Strip?
Nadia, I can't --
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
You think so?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
You want to do it?
Okay.
No...I know the perfect time...
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Stifler!!
That junior chick?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Thanks.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
What?
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Are you okay?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
It's making me hungry.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
Oh no... no....
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Yeah?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
I told him it wasn't ready...
What do you mean, maniacs?
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
You fucking liar!
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
Double merde.
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I'm not sure but look. . .
Well, I don't have any money . . .
You must have.
Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
What happened to your parents?
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I have my reasons.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
I was all out of dynamite!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
Sad?
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
I'm sorry.
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Anya... where are we?
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
You'd lose your security deposit?
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Bartok... a question.
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Pray he's color-blind...
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
It worked in Odessa...
Run, Anya -  go...
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
What's your name?
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
This guy's on television.
You don't want my autograph.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Why not?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Alvy.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Well, then, w-who was?
Hey, that was last year.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Me? Oh, downtown!
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Yeah.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Right!  Where?
Uh, you're driving a-
Well, where is it? I-
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Oh, you do?
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Yeah, I know.
You sure?
No, I got time.
Neat, yeah.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, huh?
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
think that's, uh-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
No.  You're a wreck.
No.
Yeah?
What? What?
Yeah?
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah?
M'hm.
Yeah.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Do I love you?
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Yeah.
I dunno.
I have a tiny apartment.
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Oh, come, you don't need that.
No, I'm fine.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Are yuh?
I didn't follow you!
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
It's his name.
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
Yeah?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
M'm.
M'hm.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Sinatra?
and I keep, you know, it's-
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
Life. I said, "life."
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
David! David! I can't believe this!
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
It was just great!
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Oh! My God! 
What thing?
yes, we had, uh...
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Remember that day?
Thanks, honey.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
I'm late.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
I have a headache.
Jesus!
I can think of another word.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Who said that?
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
...as opposed to a print...
Oh, do yuh?
Yes.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Hey.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
You'll total the whole car.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Well, sit down.
There are no twos, Max.
We're gonna operate together.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
You think so? Do you really?
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Well, hi!
Yeah.
Hey-
It was a wonderful set.
Oh, gosh.
Yeah.
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
One guess.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
The movie.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
I don't know how to make her funny.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
Well, probably.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Never.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Leave us alone right now.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Forget it, Judy.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
It was fifteen seconds.
Are you always this much fun?
Yeah, thanks pal.
Fantastic.  Out here.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
There's still time to undo this.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Whatever you say.
Yes.
Ryan's novel?
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
No.  I missed that.
We're great.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
What are you saying?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
This is insanity.  Sally...
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I know.
Oh, Sally Mae...
Oh, you know, I am.
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Sure.
Lovely.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Yes I did.
Don't be silly.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And I you.
Ah.
Mmm hmmm.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
I'm a little nervous, so...
A little out of my element.
Hm.
I will treasure this.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
I think he's really angry with me too.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
A lot of cakes.
And he doesn't smoke?
You must have been a baby.
I'm so sorry.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Time!
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Not good.
He always has two or three going...
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Sally?
Are you working on a new book?
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Yes.
I so wish I'd known.
How long ago was it?
Thank you.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Would you, like, marry him?
Are you asking me to marry you?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Rose.
I'll be right out.
What are they?
Hm.
So how much do you hate her?
I trust you.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Hlllllllp!
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
There's something going on, Z --
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Duty calls!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Why are we so successful?
...Ants...
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
My mother.
Under the mat? 
Something the matter?
Well, I have some paper towels --
So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?
You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
It's a bet.
Oh, I never catch colds.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
That's me. 
Really?
Fine.  Wait.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
Sure.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Yeah.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
You're so right.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Three.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
Who?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
Miss. 
No -- it's my stomach.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Sure.
I'm not very good at it.
I don't want it.
Too slow?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
No doubt about it.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Do I have to?
I just want some fresh air.
For me?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
In the knee?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Yes, nurse.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Cheers.
What?
So I want you to keep a clear head.
I never thought he'd do it.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Sir?
Who?
Are you going to deny it?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
Oh?  Oh!
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Thank you, sir.
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
Sir?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Oh?
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Thank you, sir.
No I didn't.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
You threatening me?
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
Sure.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Sure, Doc.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
I'm with you, lover.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I don't know.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
You know I liked it better long.
It's been hell.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
I don't believe you.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
We talked about a lot of things.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
That's enough, Fran.
Are you sure that's what you want?
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Now, Fran --
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Merry Christmas.
Stop that, Fran.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
He wouldn't.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Where does she live?
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
It's a thought.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Yeah.
Well --
Esprit de corps --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Moonby what?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Sure, thanks.
Part.
Rangers, eh?
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Let's talk about you.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
A sauciere --
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
I don't believe you --
I don't know.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Yeah, I know.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Who knows what's up there?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
Signs?
Yeah -- like keep out --
What is it?
Too far inland.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
Whose orders ?
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Nobody comes in here.
Charlie?
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
They must have seen the fire.
A lame ?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
But why ?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
What'd you do for supplies?
Who knows.
Don't you agree?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
The enemy. Who else?
I'm Kurtz.
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
No -- no, sir.
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
I can handle it.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
Yes...
And you admired him?
Yes, I know...
Both of us...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
You think?
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
Cognac?
No. Not really.
What did you hear?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
What?
C'mon --
107  CONTINUED:
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
I just want this over with.
157  CONTINUED:
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
The radio's on the fritz.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
I bet you haven't had lunch.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
That's my line.
I'll tell you everything later.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
So what's the problem?
I'm staying.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
New to the country, kid?
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
I'm here to do my job.
You don't feel cold?
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Shut up!
The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
What does this matter to you?
Fuck you.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Stay out of it.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
You met the gift.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Uh-huh.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
Since forever.
Yes.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
His home number.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Okay.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Thank you.
I want you to go on this trip.
My son.
What's that got to do with it?
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
No.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Can we order first?
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Sex with Simon?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.
I'll take a bus.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
Cute.
I should've danced with you.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
I had to see you...
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
What a nice compliment.
Uh-huh...
How to die, mostly.
Good night.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
What are you trying to do to me?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
About a dog.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Absolutely.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
'Love was... '
Maybe this can wait.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Get out.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Now we'll both call him.
Yo, yo, yo...
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Got any easier questions?
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
I'm going back with you.
Because...  ... you love her?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
What?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Just do your job.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Okay, don't.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Sounds like chickenshit --
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Bain!
Yes, sir.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
He stole another contract.
Robert?  Robert?
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Ten million --
You didn't know anything about me.
Until a minute ago.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Why?
He wants to kill you?
Why?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Right.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Jesus -- why?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Ahhhh...
Why?
Why?
Are they usually like that?
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
You said you didn't trust it.
Mexico.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
In Costa Blanca.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
The beach?  It was nice.
Cheap as shit.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
That means you won't have a gun.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
I was.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
I think I got one today.
So?
Jesus, if someone had --
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Why?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Why?  I don't know.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
It can be.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
She was taken.
Is this becoming complicated?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Okay.
I thought it was interesting --
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Everyone regrets something.
A dime.
Taken.
Right.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Why didn't you fade?
Yeah.
No.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
Like you?
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
But we are underground?
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
And not even then sometimes.
Like Custer huh?
Care to elaborate?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
You got my word on it.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Tough break.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
Don't we have enough already?
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
Is it gone four-thirty?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
No, for the Asylum.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
So why didn't we?
Who put a bee up your butt?
Both, see you later.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
So I hear.
They ain't the only ones.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
You're kidding.
WE gotta think of something.
Now you're using that word.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
I'm not hungry, really.
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You're sure?
No, by road?
Yeah!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
I've been around.
Sure. Excellent.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Thanks.
But I love you!
Not this time, Kat.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
It's not so much.
Yo, dobree!
Deal!
You mean it's started?
We don't need you.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
Thanks.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Yeah seems okay.
Sure!
Run into Josh?
Cool!
Really!
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
A drill, what are you up to?
Yeah.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Yeah.
Go to hell!
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
We're not sure...
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
With you.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
'Bout what?
It could help with a new car --
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
He wants to show now.
Yeah.
That'd be something.
You do --
And you don't.  What's she doing in there?
It was.
What kind of a man are you, son?
-- This your idea of small talk?
I don't make small talk --
Can't you have a normal conversation?
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
No. Not like you.
So you agree you need help?
I'm an enemy?
Go for it.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Know so.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
In 76 years, me neither.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Then maybe you can read mine.
Prove it.
I don't want to be just your friend --
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
No.
Fun.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Loved?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Away from here.
I was twelve.
You planned this --
No. Why? Are you seducible?
No.
What are you going to -- ?
Where? Why?
I will.
I don't want to come here anymore.
'Find out who you are and do it on purpose.' Dolly Parton.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
Better. I was really angry.
I have expectations, too.
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Lead man.
No.
You decide.
I'm not tired.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
I'm no dummy.
That's right. You just act like one.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
Yeah.
Yes, sir!
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Learn anything?
Uh, hi....
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Coming, Eileen...
Eileen, Chinese food again?
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
The drill!  The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.
Good.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Well... yeah...
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
I'm going to be at the dance.
Why what?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
What?
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
Home, school, here... 
A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Is Shemp all right?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
So what? We'd be rich!
No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
The power converter...
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
That's just great!
You were ringing the doorbell!
What if you lost your keys?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
You did what?!?
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
Perfect...
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
What do you call this? 
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
A Tab.
What did you do to your hair?
He said not to tell.
What's going on?
Okay.
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
I'll catch up with you.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Does he bite?
He never bit me.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Mmmmm.
They're okay.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What're you doing?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
No, you're not either.
I don't know.
What for?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Nothing.
Quit my job.
Great.
Spanish.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
But it would hurt.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Really?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Sure.
Yes.
Just thinking.
Fine.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
What?
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
First thing I did.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
She wants a picture.
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
Where's the professor?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Don't shoot!
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Go away.  Let me rot?
The girl I remind you of.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
No, I don't.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
She was killed, Penny.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
You don't wanna know.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
John Whorfin will kill us!
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Why me?
I didn't drop 'em.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Why me?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Drown all those rascals...
...Who?
Chet! From downstairs!
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
So be it.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Then who should I talk to?
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well I...
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
To do what?
What do you do far a living?
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
No, what did it say?
Okay.
What do you mean, Barton?
That's all right, really, thank you.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
Where there's life there's hope.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
You're leaving?
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Are you sure 
No... Can I come in?
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
Yeah.
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy  like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Lou.
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
No kidding, bright boy  we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
We got a treatment on it yet?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Mr. Lipnik, please 
No.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
Thanks.
It's been three months.
How about the coke?
Yes.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Tell me about Catherine.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
What?
Yes.
Did you go home with him?
Are you arresting me?
I quit.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
It won't last.
That's right.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
There's a name from the past.
Didn't you study it in school?
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Do you?
Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink?
Don't get too cocky.
Not me.
What if I call you Nicky?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
What's it about?
It hurts.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
Try me.
When?
About three months before I met you.
Why?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
Come over here and tell me no.
I'm writing a book.
Why?
Somebody always does.
Did you ever tie him up?
How's that?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I hope I helped you out.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.  One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor.
What is it you got between you?
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I know what that's like.
I went over last night, too.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
I don't believe it.
Why not?
Catherine told me what was in it.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  Oh, man.
What do you want?
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Can there be some mistake?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
It's in New Jersey.
Ignorant art?
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
That's good. At least they're interested.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
Who?
Aren't they?
How much for these five?
You should talk to him about this.
I can get ten.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
I need a dealer.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
You mean like an ape?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Yeah.
Very well.
Out?
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Good. What do you have?
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
What who's saying?
Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I'm your family.
I hadn't thought about it.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
What's wrong with me?
A present I picked up for you.
George?
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
Yeah, it's the best one.
That's great.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
So shut up and keep painting..
A what?
I didn't know.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
Uh-oh!
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
No, actually I feel worse.
Alright, thanks.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Hanging on every word.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Things change.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Well that's a ... long story ...
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Oh.  "Kyle."
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
Yes and no...
Had one.  Didn't work.
Photojournalist.
Weird, huh?
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
PMS.
... eight, seven...
My lips are sealed.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Actually, it's a lot like that.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Eventually she married a young physician.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
What is it?
The boys need help.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
What seems to be the problem?
Women.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Damn?  Damn is not good.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
She knows who we are.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Dick, don't push me right now.
I knew you could handle it.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Dear daisy, don't despair.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
I find that unlikely.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
How about dangerous curves?
I've got to stop him.
Then you never loved me?
Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
It'll never work.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
What did you say?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
There's one other thing. I feel..
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
Enigma.
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
How ya doin', Al?
Al?
And you are?
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
Why's that?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Nostrovia.
Slanta.
That's usually my line.
And into a black dress.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
Touchy, touchy.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
What?
Excuse me.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
I don't think so.
...You gonna kill me?
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
Never heard of a double-cross?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
WHICH CAR?
I'll take you with me.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
What is it you want?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
As far as I know.
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
No.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
I feel naked without it.
... Where are you calling from?
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
Take 'em! I want his head!
WHAT?
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
What?  I improved her a little...
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
Yum, yum.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Yeeees?
There aren't hotels?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
One.
Hi.....  Roses.
Meaning?
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Night.
Uh ... yes ...
What?  What?
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
David?
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
I beg your pardon?
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
You're not going to ....
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Ahm....
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Sure did.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Yes?
off the peg?
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
The TV.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Me first?
Me first! Me first!
Me first!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Turd-burglar...
Bunghole...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Yer late.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Heh heh, thanks.
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Deep and hard.
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
You scored with two chicks?!
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
How's your arm?
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
But I'm not hungry, are you?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
At least we won't have to worry about her.
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
That's all we need.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
I didn't --
You can build another one... with her.
All right.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Really.  I don't know.
I got an A!
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Help vouchers?
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
You don't kill anyone.
Can you scare them off?
Now, let's get rolling!
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
What do you mean?  What's he do?
No, Lydia, we're dead.
I want to be dead too.
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
Otho'll know what to do.
Why not?
... sheets.
I cannot believe this.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
I'm sorry already.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Viridian?
Viridian?  What is...?
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Why not?
I understand. I've seen it done before.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Thank you.
Yes, Robert. I will.
It's fine today, Robert.
No, Robert.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
I have no idea...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
No. I like this attic very much.
Your family doctor?
I agree.
Oh? Certainly...
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
I am a very good gardener.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Our greenhouse.
Thank you, Eve.
No, thank you.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Thank you.
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
That's very interesting, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, very well, thank you.
I agree.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
So you know Krylov!
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. I like that name very much.
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
I agree.
And I'm Ben.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Yes. I would like to do that.
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Hello, Ronald.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Good day, Sally.
It's very sore.
... Yes sir - elevator!
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes, I'm very hungry.
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
No, I do not have any of those.
1952...?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Do you feel well enough for that?
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Look, Johanna...
I said good night!
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Oh? What?
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
You take care too, Bobby.
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
I never played a jewel thief.
Tell your friends.
Enjoy.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Hmmm.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
The iguana.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
I'm scared.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
You've always hated the animals.
Fuck Maxine.
And he was with her.
Me and John.
You bastard.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
I'm a puppeteer.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
The monkey.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Let me try!
I know. I'm sorry...
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
No. I understand perfectly.
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
Yessir.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Thank you, sir.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
Emily Dickinson.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
I'm right?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Yeah. But enough about me.
The usual, Barry.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
You're a fag or a liar.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Why are you being like this?
Fork ah did?
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Thank you, Floris.
Do you?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Do we get to wear a crown?
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
When?
I love you, Lotte.
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Who needs dancing?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh, Lotte...
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Derek Mantini!
Whatever.
What want ye, girl child?
Then what do I do?
Say the Word!
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying nothing counts?
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Aw, Baby.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
Baby, don't be like that.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
Yes?
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
I don't. I have my own.
I will.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Yes ma'am.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Extra?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Won't you be late for work?
She likes this dress...
Oh I been out.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
That's so.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
I don't believe that. I won't.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Leave off..
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Paul D.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Yeah. Too sweet. 
Yes sir.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Why me, man?
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
The?  Who the fff--
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
That is for the urn.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
What--
I was bowling--
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
What the fuck is he talking about?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
Uh-huh.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
Different mothers, huh?
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Yes, heh--
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
You mean coitus?
He fixes the cable?
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
She most certainly was not!
Now I got--
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
I want you to see him immediately.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Finder's fee?
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
What?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Okay. That, uh.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
What the fuck are you--
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Am I wrong!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
Just for making the hand-off?
What if it's during a game?
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Easy, Dude.
That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
"Our" car, Walter?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Aw, fuck it.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
The nail polish, Walter.
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
What about the toe?
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Thanks Walter.
Nihilists!  Jesus.
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Is the car out front yours?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money!
Dude?
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Shit yeah!
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
Uh-huh.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
Yeah.
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
I don't know, sir.
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
I said out.  Now.
Stay away from me, mister!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
A world of pain.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Either that or feeding the worms.
Sounds like a plan.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Blood...
For what?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
He was here.  Watching us.
Nomak?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
From his father, of course.
You experimented on your own, son?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Scud.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
No, we can treat the wounds --
I don't buy it.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Frost!!!
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Who is LaMagra?
"The Blood Tide".
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
It worked, didn't it?
He didn't. Get over it.
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
And that's a good thing?
How can you tell?
Some kind of archive --
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I've been better --
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
I know. Take some of my blood.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
For them. But for me --
You don't have to be.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
No problem.
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
Perhaps.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
What happens then?
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
You've been listening in the whole time?
Go on, I'll be fine!
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Habit, mostly, just like this.
He killed them?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
How?
--which she may have--
Join the club.
Try, please, Anna--
What happened to her, where did she go?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Bullshit! Talk!
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
--a six week bun in the oven--
Who?
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
Oh, sorry, right.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
--Nick!!
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Anna--
--fine, later, fine.
I don't know.
I don't know. Nightmare.
I want to see the tapes.
We've looked at half of one tape.
Here.
Why?
Yeah.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
I can't let you in.
I want amphetamines.
Both. Now.
Sometimes.
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Fine.
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
Try a long walk.
Butt-ugly owl.
Just go.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Don't have one.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Fucking owl!
Down there in the Park.
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
--Domini!
--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
Anna's the witch.
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--a Wiccan--
Fine.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
I think it's time to get out of here.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
No. I don't think so.
Why she kills children.
--and we brought it back with us!
He'll never know.
Get some more beer.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
I'm sorry.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--it's urgent!
--the Sheriff's Office--
Your mother's pastor.
Yes.
I am?
Abby...
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
What was that?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Where... where you going?
See a guy.
I just gotta see a guy.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
...Huh?
I couldn't believe it either...
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
...Mm-hmm.
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
I think someone's watching.
About ten years.
Going out with Meurice.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
Ever durned one.
No.
What's the matter?
Back where?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Yeah.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Got a job for you.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Got something to show me first?
I don't know, didn't he call?
Right.
What.
For what?
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Tuesday.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Yeah. How's Dad?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Hello, daddy.
Then, shut up!
If you want to.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Alright, suit yourself.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Yeah.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey nothing.
Nobody.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
Yes.
Sure I'm alright. 
No. please. I won't.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
I'm alright. go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Hello.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank-
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
That's good.
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Does that scare you?
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
They hurt his head.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Maybe so.
I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Brilliant.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
O.K.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay. yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Are you sure?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Okay, Sandy.
See ya tomorrow.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey?. Why?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
What is it?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Just a minute.
Yes.
... Sandy?.
Hey Jeff.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Be right down.
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
What?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Alright.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Alright.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
I'll get a coat for her.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Yes, I am.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
We want some grass.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
Yeah.  She told me.
You?
For calling you a homo.
That was out of line.
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
Oh my G-d.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
Okay.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Try the closet.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I love you too, man.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
No more brothers, Diego.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Who's the cheapskate?
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
It's beautiful.
I want money.
Power?
Family.
Sure.
Yeah, well...
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I know.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
You're not going to trial?
Good.
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
Hello.
Why are you smiling?
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Yeah.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Yeah.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
But I've got school.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Yes, I do.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
What?
That's right.
The strike is a success; but ...
And you believe the NLF?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Sid Ahmed.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
It's true.
Sure. By shooting at me.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No, and neither were my men.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Good evening, sir.
A name?
Let's hope forever.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
You got something on the Coke?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Thanks, Mister D.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
The official cause?
No.
What induced it?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Increase his heart rate.
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Your witness.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
I didn't hear it.
Back off, John.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You've been following me?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
No -- but I can get it for you.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
What did Mr. Marsh say?
Show me.
Yes.
How long were you together?
Intense.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
What happened after that?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Did you ever see her again after that?
Why?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
What did she say?
I was angry.
No further questions.
That's enough.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
No.
No.
No.  No, I don't.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Yes.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
No.
High school?
Yes.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
What happened?
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
What changed?
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Yes -- cocaine.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
He video taped you.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
Three fifteen.
Yes.
Why'd you come here?
Yes.
And she left shortly after that?
No further questions.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
Something like that.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
That's not an answer.
Yes -- she did.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yeah.
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
You're a monster.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Shoot him.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
I'm always open to learning new things.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
That's too bad.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
What time did you leave?
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
I said NO!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
Lawyer here?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Michael.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Don't say that!
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Then why do you?
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
I never knew that.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Did we want to?
Oh, yes.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Heat is heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
I'll get right on it.
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
That's it.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Oh! You caught me.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Not at all.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
About a year and a half.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Clean?
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
We got engaged.
Oh you!
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Woman friends, too?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
No, I'm just saying --
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
What made you ask such a question?
No. I was just... No.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Oh, how is he?
Are you hungry?
No.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
How about Bari?
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I had a temper.
What were your parents like?
Yes, thanks.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
Then he can move! People move!
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Betty.
Okay.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
I know damn well she's there.
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
Just some flies.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Spooked?
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Just try it.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Let me see your hand.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Have you ever been inside?
I lied.
Your father.  He was your father.
Mother!  No.
How do you know?
Lucky thing.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
And you believe her?
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
I can't find you.
Here!
I can't!
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
Shit, that was fast.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
It was just like in my head.
You haven't?
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
But the place burned to the ground.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
Where's what?
The money!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Gimme the gun.
What are you going to do with it?
That doesn't make any sense.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
All right, Caesar.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
But it could be anywhere.
He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Pretty good, sir.
Go right ahead, sir.
Another time.
No.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
I could be lying.
Hey, Mickey.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Me?  Why?
Yeah, that's it.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
...  thank you.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
Good guess.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Yeah.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
Maybe.
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
I wanted to apologize.
No.
Yes, it is.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What the fuck was it?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
What choice?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
Do you think you know me like that?
Then what?  Exactly.
To let it dry.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Yeah, twice.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Any bodyguards?
Fine.
An accident.
Shit!  Oh shit!
Not Caesar.
Thank you.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I think we're going to find out.
What if he doesn't run?
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Violet?
I don't know what we're talking about.
I thought you were never going to do that.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Yes.
What is Treadstone?
I think so.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
I don't think so.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
I don't know.
Get the kids out!
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Right.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Look, maybe I should just...
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Yes, I'm here...
Yes.
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Okay.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I've got a situation here and --
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I know that.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
What?  Like amnesia?
No.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Anytime.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You knew he was coming.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
Who paid the bill?
I don't know. 
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
Go back to the hotel.
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
That's the only angle.
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
What's that?
Enhance it.
-- I'm on it --
I tried.
What have you done to my flat?
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
Got there!
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
... yer ducts.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Gillian Layton?
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
No, no ... I did that...
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Mr Helpmann!
Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Am I?
Christ! You do know it all!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
I'm sure you have
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Do you know what you're doing.
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Is it stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Ah.
It's you ... it's you ...
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Please!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Why not?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Looking for you.
Suit me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Who is this war against, Sam?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Every day?
Turn around!
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
We? Don't blame me!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Leave me alone!
No you're not!
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
What's the matter?
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
You want to take my console into your office?
Yes.
I'm sorry but ...
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
You're not listening, mother.
What is it?
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Um ...
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
I ... uh ...
Er, yes ...
Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Thank you for calling Cen -
What? Who is this?
No need, sir
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
We'll be back.
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
But ... I called Central Services.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What do they want you or?
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
No, no, that's impossible.
Mary said you might be coming.
She asked me to pick her up.
I better just go in and see her.
Got a beer?
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Just take it easy.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
No way, man.
What did you say?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
He's dead, huh?
Did you see my father?
He's working a double shift.
She should go home.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I'll be right down.
I think it looks good.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
Not as good as Nino's.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
Fifteen minutes.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Because you can barely walk.
There's no time.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
God help us, he's hungry too.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
That's too many.
It's coming.
Greatest job in the world.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
A medical miracle.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
No.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
I've taken that into consideration.
It's early for him.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Faster!
Relax, will you.
One more time!
No way!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
Keep it to yourself.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
There are only ten.
Fifty, right?
No?
No.  Don't worry about it.
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
Eventually rising to...
Ravenous homosexual.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
Sure.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Did you shoot their boots?
Watch? --
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Then it went well.
Do others feel that you did well?
I'm not kidding.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
This is important to me.
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
Really?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
Your hair's a little funny.
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Stop it.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Yeah --
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
So I quit.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I spent a fortune on this.
Let me hear it!
One's enough.
Yes.  How do you know?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Finish quickly.  I don't want you getting obsessive about these things.  Good night.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
I like "godsend."
Yes, sure.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
Uh-huh.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Well, what is it?
Yes.
It's not important.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Me!
Uh-uh.
Great.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Well, when?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I know.  I taped it.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Okay.  Good night.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
How can you say that to me?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
I got promoted for things like that.
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
I can't be.
Right back to you.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Yes, I'm sorry.
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
I just might.
I didn't finish talking to you!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Uh-huh.
Are you nervous, Walter?
N-no...
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Of course...it's wonderful.
What's it called?
Oh...
Here here...
Hm...
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
No! I want to talk about it now!
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Hm.
When did you make this, Walter?
What are you doing here so early?
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well it sure looks dead enough.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
I didn't mean to.
Well I don't know -
Well...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
A parakeet?
Good night Walter.
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
You want me to open a window or something?
Yeah, why?
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
Hm.
Huh?!!!
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Walter shut up and relax!
Yes, get rid of them...
Call me...Maxwell.
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Here here!
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
What do you get?
With Dead Cat?
Really?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Shut up!  You let him have it!
Cheer up.  You may still.
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Coach knows what abs are?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
I mean it.
Eeyuu.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Jealous?
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
'Bye.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
I thought we were meeting here.
You left me a message?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Mmkay.
I know.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
Where?
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Get a boob job.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Why?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
In Virginia.
China.
Cramps?
This is it.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
All right.
Our purposes.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
I had to test you.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
Your turn.
Try to pay attention.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Five.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
How can you keep doing this?
I'm curious, is all.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
I guess.
Thanks.
Sorry.
You're having a fling with him?
Hi.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Oh.
So very much.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
Hi, Grueller.
Good.
Throw it out.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Well, look who's here.
Nice much.
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Except for Prom.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I am.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
What?
Which nostril am I breathing through?
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Nuke?!
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
I'll tuck you in.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
I think I'm ready for the Show.
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
He's a virgin.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
You got me all confused.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
And now you wanta teach me?
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
Yeah...you a witch?
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
We gonna fuck or what?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You missed him!
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You missed the tag!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
But he ain't seen my heat--
Gimme that.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
Yep.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
What?
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Crash, shut the door.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
Can I give you my testimony?
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
We're getting married.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
It's a miracle.
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Okay...
Looking for Crash Davis.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
I can't believe you're doing this.
You were never my guest?!
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Liar.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
Congratulations.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
Lester...
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Help, Daddy!
Ginger.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Four aces, Doc.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
No.
Okay.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I'll be honest with you.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Yeah.
It's none of my business?
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
You never - ?
She was afraid to call you.
Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Seven o'clock?
And they were usually right.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
You've got to stop her.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
...position...
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
No. Just stop everything.
Certainly.  Senator.
Call security.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
What is it?
Who's this?
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
Thanks a lot.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
Yeah, I know all that.
I - I - I...
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Okay.
Oh, it's so soft.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
Yeah.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
What's it...
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You're not takin' Amy.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I threw it away.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
Oh...
I should have -
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
Don't you threaten me!
Don't you threaten me!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
Well...
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -
Well, I... I never tried.
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
Thank you.
Mm.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
He won't let me go in my house!
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Go get a bag, man.
Pitch-black?! It -
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
It's instinctive, you know.
He tries to do everything...
Carmine's gone.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
What're you gonna do?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
All right.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Yeah.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
What? What?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Okay.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
Exactly.
I did what you told me to.
Everything went to his head. 
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
All right, all right.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Yes.
Come on! 
Yeah.
God... I wish you...
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
It means I got the money.
Lester - he called you here.
Right.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
'Go! Go! Go!'
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Pleasure.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
They're havin' a good time too.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
Hey.
You're a little confused?
Yeah.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
I'm sorry.
There's a lot of people here.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
Then do it the way you want.
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
Are you sure?
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
We'll hunt him down together...
It may be time to get the police involved...
Winning.
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Well. I stand corrected.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
I still have one left...
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
Men, huh?
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
Did you just say "girls?"
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Ask me another one--
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Actually, yes.
Like you don't know...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Uh-huh..
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Not too cool...
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
But I'm blind.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Taking messages.
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Did you have to tell her my name?
You gotta just look the other way.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
I'm going to level with you officer.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
If you know that just back off.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
I improved on the fucking original.
Who smashed the phone?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Then hang up!  Do it!
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
A price on everything.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The one in Brentwood.
Not a chance.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
What's going on?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
You can't give up.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
God, if he doesn't come back --
Are you okay?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Yes.
Yes sir.
Can you walk?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
Hand me the phone.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
At least one.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
You wouldn't --
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Did you hear that?
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Naturally.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Whatever you say.
There are no guarantees in this life.
What time frame have you got in mind?
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
We don't see you.
It's your call.
Talk to the man.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
My pleasure --
Negative.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Put the girl on.
Call me "Nels."
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Who's this?
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Five minutes.
How do you know?
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Seems not.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Let me talk to the lady again.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Doesn't everybody?
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
He's what she should run a mile from.
She's not a girl, Col --
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Persistent.
You heard me --
Cunt.
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
She's not that either.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
In a way.
Guy I work with.
What's his name?
What's it to you?
Nothing.
Not English.
And what's it like?
Yes, thank you.
Jesus.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Whiskey.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Are you jealous of him?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
He did sometimes.
Something I heard someone say once.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I'm thinking of your man.
What you doing here?
Give it over, Dil --
Nothing's wise.
So I'm sorry.
Whenever. Tonight.
Sorry.
Are you pretending yet?
Stop it, Jimmy.
A little.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Don't be cruel.
Only if you kiss me.
Not at all, honey.
Okay.
No.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Yes.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
And you wouldn't leave me?
You like me better like this.
Yes.
For me.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
I was trying to get out of something.
You knew which man?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
He asked me to see were you all right.
Stop it, Dil --
Let them come then.
I like you, Dil --
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
You do?
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Will I see you again?
I promise.
Yes. Say hello to Col --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
What's that supposed to mean?
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
That's wise, Tommy.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
Someone's got to do it.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
I heard.
I know.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
And what happens then?
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
And do you know why?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Hope not.
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
Yeah.
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
No?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Could you?
So I've noticed.
Do what?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
You want to bet?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
No, what's the funny thing?
She's a friend of mine
What?
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Best game in the world.
Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.
Give us a break.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Don't be so sure.
Jody's always right.
Doesn't matter where.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Do you?
We don't look on it like that.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Don't know her.
If they kill me --
I'm sorry.
A story.
What does that mean?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
You don't know me, do you?
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
It's all right -- look.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Lord, you're stubborn.
Of course there is!
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
I'm through listening to you!
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
You mean spies and things like that?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But --
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Oh.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Who?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
May I have a cigarette, please?
Me? Why me?
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Next, please.
No.
The last one, please.
Starting with his own.
Oh.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
Or you --  Or you --
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
Why you lied to me.
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
I'm not fifteen.
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
Who told you to do that?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
What -- like Scobie?
I'm scared.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Well!
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
What do you mean?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Yes.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
What's its value today?
In money.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Tell me what?
Leave?
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
And this? And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Why, do you think we're going to?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Yes.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Shakespeare never said that.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
How did you find out?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Doing what?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Come on. You can't stay here.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
I wasn't --
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
What was what?
How would you like a spanking?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
How do you know what they're doing?
Words can hurt very much.
Yes?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
Va jouer, mon ange.
a alors! From Charles?
I've never seen him before.
He's allergic to him.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Oh la vache!
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
As fucking if.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
Ok!
Good.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
I want you to head right home after school.
I will. Is that all?
What's wrong?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
We're seeing all the signs in town.
She's still a virgin.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
No, you couldn't.
Really?
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
You're not?
Ok.
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
I really do. For your own safety.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
He says he loves me.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
NO?!
Especially not your dad.
Stag?
I can't right now.
Don't you think it's sick?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
What?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
I'll think about it.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Yeah.
What?
I love you.
Did he say anything else about her?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Not that I know of.
The library. I'll be fine.
You didn't believe her?
Just thinking about something.
And she didn't?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
They're tasty.
Hide your laptop here.
Unfair?!
...shit.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Where do you want this stuff?
No argument there.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since today.  New policy.

He could've called first.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
...and a shitload of ice.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
I need your help.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
And if that Elvis shit...
All right.
You want cash?
I got, uh....
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
...doing?!
Come on, get in the truck.
Shut...
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...town. 
Oh, man.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
...-er.
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
Hey.
Ah, one of them's in the back.


...-ed.
All right.
...gun?!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...-er!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...I believe in live and...
I did not steal the truck.
 
...truck!

Back up!  Back...


...Shift.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!

Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
God, man!

Come on.
...you crazy bastard.
Gee, you think so?

...ho!

 Shit. 

Come on.
Okay.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
These'll keep it cold.

Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.
I'm a dangerous man!
You're--?  What?!
...here!
Oh, shit.
Okay.  Okay.

Oh, no!
 All right.  Hey.
You're fucked, man.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...stole the truck.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
We were nationally  ranked.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
...shit.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...miles.
Yeah.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Bring him down!

Huh?


Arlo!  Arlo.
 Come on!
 Okay.
Okay. 
Come here.
Go!


Oh, shit.
Okay.
And Brynner's right on...
...tunnel!
What?
 
 
It's working.
...-ta get outta here!
 There's gotta be...
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
They'll meet you at the top.

What'd you come back for?!

We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Always the negative...
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
That's bullshit.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
I feel faint.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
 big balls.
That was quick.
...within five minutes.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
But...

So...where's my truck?
...help you?
 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!
We do need your truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...owe you.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
...including the permanently extreme.


I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now listen to me.
...destroyer of worlds."
No!

There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look fit...healthy...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...and the government.
Grateful?
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...always done, Richard?
Went away? 
"Went away."  I like that.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Forget about him.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Pleasant surprise.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.

You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Prep the launcher now.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
We were called in by the Jerome base...
You know the suspect?
Richard Long.
Mornin'.
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
Like I say, Doc Long's...
I don't know what the hell...

I would've in another life.

They took that life away and left me with nothing.

I can handle it.

Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
...the master of his realm.
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...and that power...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
Some people might.
Doc!
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
 The only one who understands what this me-...
Doctor.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
What?
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Yeah.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
...you answer mine.
So you don't remember...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...public drunkenness....
I didn't sell the boy any...
...to talk, son.
What happened to Colonel Brynner?

He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
It doesn't hurt.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
I think I gave it to her.
Oh yes.
Would you call him a capable man?
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Is she all right?
Where is she?
Haven't the faintest idea.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
How do you do that?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
I'm not.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Summer colds are the worst.
Yeah, they are.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
I heard it was an accident.
You accusing me of extortion?
Absolutely.
Matter of fact I do.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
No.
Do you know where she might be?
Mr. Gittes.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
What are you having?
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Please call first.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Oh... thank you.
A check?
I have?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
I was grateful.
Mr. Gittes.
No. I'm just a snoop.
No, not for that one.
I don't believe you.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
No.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
What? What is it?
Is that unusual?
They may not know it but they are.
Get in the car.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Why?
What were you doing there?
Yeah.
He owns it. You know?
You saw my fa... father? When?
There hasn't been a lot of time.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
She's not tied up!
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I will if you don't.
Where's the girl?
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
No...
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
I'll take care of it.
He didn't wear bifocals.
I'm all right.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
When did you come in?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Don't know her. Take a number.
Okay.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
Oh, good.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Help yourself.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Only when I breathe.
I said, the northwest valley.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
When it comes.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah.
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Mr. Gittes...
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Of course not.
But I have to know.
He was expecting you?
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
What about?
Yeah.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
No, you have a press agent do it.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Too bad!
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
You never used to do that!
So what's that got to do with it?
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Where is he?
That's all there is.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
You know why?  She was so -
Sure, sure.
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Yes.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
There is no news big enough.
Yes, Mr. kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
I'm sure that's it. 
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
Emily!
Charles.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
Toothache.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
I didn't say.
Is that what you want to do?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
At night?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
I see! 
Thanks.
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Yes, sir.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
They do it only because you do!
Yes?
Charlie -
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I'm drunk.
She was going to leave you anyway -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
What check?
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Yes.
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
It's a letter from her lawyers.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
How do you do, Charles?
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
Yes and no.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
I had a toothache.
What about that apartment?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Are you serious?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
Yeah, but not in here.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
I take it she likes the guy.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Exactly.
God, isn't he great?
Why aren't there any lights?
You're kidding.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
He was?
I feel nauseous.
Just now.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
And you said yes?
Well... kind of, sort of?
How like her.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Jesus, you're caustic.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Sang.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Like what?
Um... okay.
Call the police.
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
She thought it was me.
Pack of cigarettes.
So I'm told.
Are you open?
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Yeah.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Go open the sore.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
You win.
Seven months.
Five years.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That's cheating?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
What do you mean?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Oh, my God.
That girl was vile to you.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
You know what I just watched?
Return of the Jedi.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
The Emperor.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Yeah.
There's more?
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
And the second time around...?
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Nudie booth?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
I guess not.
Can we talk about this later?
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let's hear it.
Which ones?
Why not?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
I don't back down.
Sorry.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Exactly. They drank it all.
Jesus.
Why not?
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
You hardly knew her!
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
An embarrassing way to die.
Bible truth.
No!
He made it, hunhh?
I never tried it.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Let me borrow your car.
Please, get the hell out of here.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
You're bullshitting.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
Shut the fuck up!
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What time did we go to the funeral?
I think four.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
What time did you get to work today?
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Same time. What about you?
I'll call you. Let you know.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
Helluva day.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
Excuse me?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
They are not.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
Nothing personal.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
We were going to start again, I think.
Maybe.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
The white kind.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Typically male point of view.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Oh, you think so?
Something wrong?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
Including you; yes.
Three?
I'm not the pig you are.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Where?
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm serious...
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
That's because I never had sex with him!
HOW MANY?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
What're you talking about?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
Can I have your name please?
WHAT?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
He's your cousin?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
I do about three-fifty, four.
Feel that.
Yeah!
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
Bags?
The money!
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
Hey, fuck you.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
I did what I thought was right.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
My pleasure.
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
One...
Three...
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
You can stop right there.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
From one professional to another, of course.
Where?
What if he can't?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
How'd you get up here?
You got to go back now!
Making things real rough for Hal.
Remember the first time we came up here?
You attacked me.
What?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Helluva time for vanity!
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Forget it!  I refuse!
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
What the hell's going on?
No, he's gone.
How far?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Sue me.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Kill him when he gets down.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
Been punished, yeah?
Of course. Food alright?
Won't you join me, sir?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Fine, sir, fine.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Surprise?
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
Fine, fine.
Well - I'm back.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
You wanna be sick?
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Lice?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Oh.
I just say what the other person would say?
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
I've done my best, have I not?
Indeed.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Like what?
You psychic?
But not now?
Dozen times a day.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
You still carrying passengers?
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd had to dig it.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Can you finish on schedule?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Very generous.
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
I don't know...
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
I never bought that.
Elvis?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
Tell me about it.
Of course!
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work.
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You mean like benefits?
You should start a union.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Like what?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Max?  I'm Vincent.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
You're cool.
With what?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
It's a mess.
South Central.
Play music.
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
Because I have a gun and I say so.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
No you don't.
Jazz.  Music.
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Leave me alone.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
She's in the hospital.
Don't start.
What, no insurance?
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
Why?
Paid sick leave?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
One more.
You're full of shit.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
That's what you said...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
As in...? 
None of your business.
Vincent?
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Any special reason?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Look, I'm sorry --
Do you still ride?
Not for years.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
You bit someone's nose off?
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
What?
Love.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Nothing is easy.
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
What is it with you and the space program?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
I've been reading up on it.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Getting rid of my hub!
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
He was murdered.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Where then?
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
A water main broke.
Thanks.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
You saw me standing alone ...
Where are you?
You think it's a conspiracy?
You've never seen her run.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
We're very specialized.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
I don't believe you.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Working.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
This doesn't make sense.
You don't understand --
I was just thinking that.
Wasn't my idea.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
What do you mean?
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
That you come with me.
Ellie?
What?
Yes, sir.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
So?
Oh?  How's he doing?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
With me.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Ellie --
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
I don't understand.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
This... seemed best.
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
Well --
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
No primer.
How can that be?
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
This is how you see the sky?
That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
Is that your official response?
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Because I can't.
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
Okay, okay... there.
Okay.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
That's my scientist.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Can you show me?
Why did you contact us?
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
That isn't the way it works.
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
Mmm.  Look closer.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
That's what they all say.
Yavol.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
We could be together again --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
You sonofabitch.
How long was I gone?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
How do you mean?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
If you came back.
You're willing to die for this.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't follow.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
What?
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
What is it?
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Git your shovel and git to work.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
What are you doin' here?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Yeah.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Yes, Boss.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
Tramp! Beautiful!
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
What happened? How far did you get?
He's gonna be awright.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Innocent?
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Like an elephant.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Oh mah baby Luke.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Cuter.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
What are you talking about?
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You phony creep!
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
About what?
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
I thought he was lying.
Yes.  I believed him.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
In jail.
Who was the man in the basement?
You know where.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
You're afraid of him.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Michael Johnson.
Lieutenant  Quinn.
Oh, I know.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Honest to God, Ruben!
My promise.
What about her arms?
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Right.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
We were together six years, sir!
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Did you come?
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
What!? They brought the car here?
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
You're not envious?
It does.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Are we imagining it?
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I can drive.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
What about the engagement party?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
I didn't say...
I know.    I know.
Will you get time off to do that?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
When did you start smoking?
It's good exercise, Mom.
Not even if it's something positive?
A deal's a deal.
There's a spider in my room.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
I wasn't hungry.
Paul.
So are you engaged, or what?
Guess.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Don't be ridiculous.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
What are the delusions like?
I wish I could have seen that.
Break up?    They wish.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Michael, I...
But I do.     I love you, too.
Not a one.
Yeah.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Shhhh.
You've got one hell of a great body.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Promise?
I think I should go home.
Congratulations.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Always the drugs.
And all the plans we have.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
You should go.
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Sure. Of course.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
That's a big question.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
It doesn't matter who.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Oh.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I'm really sorry.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
A pass.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
My number's going to show up on his bill!
What?
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
I'm good.   Really.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Okay.   How much?
Yeah -- you do that.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
But you were there?
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
I assume you want something?
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
No problem.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Jesus!
Where are you from?
What about the money?
And the Vodka.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
I think he's already figured that out.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
I'll be Elvis and you--
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
Has to be.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
What'd you get?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
You haven't answered my question.
What do you want now?
I'm from Belgium.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
I'll tell you when it's time.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Hard to say.
You said don't do it, boss.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Everything.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Just find them!
Great fuckin' song.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I was told to take what we have and go.
You can use my car.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
We both know I'm already dead.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
No.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Uh huh.
How?
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
I don't know.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Did she break your heart?
You got it in a bar?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
A car.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
On guard!
Let's go!
You're already a thief.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Long.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
I have a guest.
You're too young to understand.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You're not married, are you?
How so?
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Come and get it if you can.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
I don't take orders from anyone.
It is trouble for me.
Don't ever come back.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Perhaps.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
Then, why did you come?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Father!
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out of her hole.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
This is a delicate matter.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Annie, I need a file.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
I knew that.
Thanks, babe.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
I have to go.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
Oh.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
That's ancient history.
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Shut up.
Very well, it's your ass.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
I know.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
On my mother's life.
Got a boyfriend back home?
Why not?
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
A friend wrote me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Why are you being so dramatic?
What'cha reading?
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I said I was sorry.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
You don't even know me.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
I'm busy.
Yes.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Reading.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
I can't win with you.
Lighten up.
No.
Not at all. Have a seat.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Why can't we be together?
Yes.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
But you knew this was important to me.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Where did you say she's from?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Okay.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Why?
It's Kathryn.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Why didn't you do something?
He made you give him a blow job.
No.
Cool.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
Just taking your photo.
I'm sorry.
I know.
I do.
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
It works a little.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Would you please leave.
You told her I never said I love you before?
And you think she bought it?
I'll be in touch.
Where is she?!
I told you I don't know.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Ronald?
Yeah?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
I'll be right there.
Racist piece of shit.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
I'll think about it...
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
Even there?
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
But who will they turn to for help?
Any day now.
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
Take a look for yourself.
Exactly the opposite.
Tell me all the details.
No, tell me.
Excuse me?
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get out!
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
War it is.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
I understand. Good night.
Excuse me?
Nope.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
She really loves me.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
But where did you get it, Amy?
At the old house with the voice.
Are they nice?
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
What's her name?
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Times have changed.
What do you mean?
You're shouting at me.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
But I told her to go with you.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
Yes, I did.
Certain wishes do.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
They ran away.
It's true.
It was just a voice.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
But...
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
No.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
You called me by my name.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But where is that?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
That's right!
That one's an elm.
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
Your children?
Oh, thank you, Amy.
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
But why?
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
It's a pretty ring.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
That means I can go alone?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
It got hit.
Mommy read it to ne.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Don't you read Shakespeare?
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Anybody could know that song.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Wait a minute. Listen.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Your lips look delicious.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
At Victoria's Secret.
Oh, on my wrist.
What else is there?
It's not just in my head.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Does she have PMS?
What does that have to do with me?
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Translation: a total geek.
He's a very talented musician.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Only to see.
Frida, grab that red one.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Why not? There's been a murder.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
You should have seen it erect.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Fall in love.
I guess you'll find out.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Well, whattdaya think?
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
I really gotta pee.
Yes I do have to pee!
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Since when do you care?
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Are you following me?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
There's a lot of that going around.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Oh my god, by wolves?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Goodnight.
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Okay, you busted me.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
My period? No.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Is that how you feel?
You didn't say it.
I love you too.
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
What about... those guys... I might have...
Thanks.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Oh my god, what happened?
Packages of money.
She's just so... pathetic.
Take some allergy medicine.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Madonna's in Penthouse?
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
What of?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Yes.  This way.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
I see...
Yes, sir.
Good.
Put it through...
Shut-up.
Don't know that either.
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
What?  Who has?
No...  No doctor...
What is that door?
But I...
Wait, this isn't fair...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
You know something about me?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Don't say a .
A month.
I promise.  I won't.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
No...
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Yeah.
Fine.
I know.
Up and around?  Soon?
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
And...
Check his kids.
Oh.  Excuse me.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
He was only doing his job.
Are you threatening me?
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
It's fine.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
You could buy it on payments.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Really?   Crazy?
At a press conference.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Why?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
Fertility beads.
The Fidelity nonsense...
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
I can't say.
No.
What's that?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
You're kidding.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
Well...
Thanks, Duane.
Uh...
I'm outta here.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Thanks.
What?
Just wait.
I guess.
It was inspirational.
I can't.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
That's okay.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
What?
Yeah... It could be fun.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're doing our best, sir.
What about the intro?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
Tonight?
Gasparilla?
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
The hospital? 
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Come on. Let's go.
What you wanna do?
Come on!
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
MARY!
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Except sex.
This is it.
Oh come on, Pitts...
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
So much the better.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
That's not my fault.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
No.
What happened?
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Knox, you're crazy.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Again!  Louder!
All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
A madman.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Father, I--
My brother went here.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
I... I just don't want to come.
Yes.  But
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
Found what?
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
A play, dummy.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
And now he will?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
No.
From you?
Quiet.  I have to think.
This play?
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
I told you...
Did you clear this?
Just trying to get to my boat...
It ain't any better out there!
I saved your life is what I did!
I'm their ride.
Seen a lot of islands?
Takes one to know one.
Yeah you did...
Yeah...
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey...
I don't know...you got what we need?
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
A little to the left...
Joey...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Poolside?
Maybe plans changed...
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
She fucked me too.
Those are mine!
Damn right!
Good... Pass the beer.
John,we're going huntin'.
I'm telling you, they changed it!
I know, but...
You don't!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Tell him, Vince.
You mean...?
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
But you must come in.
No, I --
I have to go.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Everybody love Linda.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Vince!!!
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
Kind of. You didn't know?
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Oh... You know...
I don't know! I don't know either!
I don't know.
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
What?
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
I don't know.
I... No. You do this for money?
And then you...
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Huh?
So do I.
You do?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
The shot?
Fucking A.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
From Nam?
Well, where's he from?
Merle --
You got it.
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Forget Sal?
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I like it, Nick.
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
Great. That's great.
What?
Did you get one?
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Where?
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
What's it for??
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
No.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Up.
Down.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
I'm not voting for you.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
That wasn't your plan, was it?
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Well, that's good enough for me.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Doucet killed my partner.
Technothugs.
Yes.
I was set up.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Then find me some cigarettes.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
How do I look?
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
Seat's too high.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
No -- that's for me to do.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
And serve him right!
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
That's just too bad --
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
-- in gold.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Well, I'll be -- 
I don't care.
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
About what?
You know darn well it is.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Not long -- now.
There's no joy in it for me.
I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
You really think so?
Yes.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
That's what we said.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Not all of it?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Looks right elegant, Mary.
There is nothing to worry about now.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
Isn't that your own fault?
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
I dunno.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Mary -- Jabez --
I guess we won't.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Of course not --
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
I'll do my best, Mary.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
You mean -- a jury trial?
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
So, why didn't you come?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
How about his job?
Tell me about it.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Go fuck yourself.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
I still feel like shit.
Bullshit.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Yessir.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
What about the kids?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
Hello, Sonny.
I'm really shakey.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah...
Yeah... I know.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
What are you talking about?
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
You're crazy.
I know!
Why you going to Algeria?
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
Sonny, come on out!
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Don't fuck with me ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Well, they go to guard school.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I'll be God damned if you will.
Sure - we like you.
We like you, too.
What now, Sonny?
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Okay.
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
No, not until after they killed him.
Yeah.
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
My body?  What for?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
I want him to think that.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Wyoming.
Everybody!  Back here!
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
What can he do, he's clean...
I am.
I speak what I feel.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
... Just give me time to think...
Oh my God, mother!
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Maybe...
Did Pop come down?
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
You're news, Sonny ...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
Newsman, not ...
Of course not ...
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
I don't know. They might be dead already.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
<i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
I don't know.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
That's the rumor on the street.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
No. Please enlighten me.
Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>

Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
Real good.
I be.  I'm living large.
Is that the only tape you got?
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Yes?
So?
Have you noticed something about them?
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
What?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
I don't know how he does it.
You're a drunk fool.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
I didn't.
What makes Sammy run?
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
I'm in here.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I'm going with you.
I'll see ya there.
See ya around.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Don't worry about it.
Look at that.
Do I have to spell it out?
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Yes you did.
I got no say over people.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Where we goin'?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Mookie?
That's it?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Do I love you?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Come in then.
Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
I didn't know you could read.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
That's right.
He's right.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
I love you, Black.
Sez who?
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Can you do better?  C'mere.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Too many pizzerias already there.
Then we could try something else.
We don't know nuthin' else.
I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Actually we have something for you.
In the new library there.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Gotcha.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
Coming.
Okay, what?
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
No, I'm fine thanks.
I'm just not ready.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
The principal.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
The second R is silent.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Exactly! A pirate!
Will not.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Kids.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
They can't be real.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Put some ice on it.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
...cause you said...
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
HARRY! Here he comes.
Who's your partner?
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
The answer is George Jefferson.
Sorry, no further questions.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
Oh I think you do.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Skateboard.
That's the downside. There is none.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Do we have a deal?
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Hey can be on top?
Have you got what I want?
Or maybe crossing a river!
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
We start our own class?
I think you'll make a good teacher.
And, take some more pictures.
Just like the President.
What papers?
JESSICA. Are you sure?
This band sounds terrible.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
We felt his presence.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Let him stand free!
As the legend says.
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
Yes...
Yes...
No.
Always.
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
Where?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Did they try and fail?
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
It's a pleasure...
No.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Ha!
I have no next picture.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
I never thought of that.
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
I am always on time.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
I don't know how to make goulash.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Mmph?  Where am I?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Don't let me slow you down.
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Soon, Bela... Soon.
Perfect.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
Rolling.
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
This is kind of a stream--
H-how'd you know?!
I guessed.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
So did you get his autograph?
This is my way of telling you --
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Oh, just like in the script!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
That's ridiculous.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
Like <u>what</u>?!
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
<u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Yeah.  Exactly!
What other sixty-thousand?
That's not true --
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
Hruphh...?
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Oh, of course!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Yes?
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
Are you a fruit?
No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
Who?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Maybe it needs special handling.
"Your movie"?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
The marriage already ended.
How long's he been here?
"Dracula."
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Oh.  Okay.
Bela died.
Uh, atomic energy?
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
My chiropractor!
Huh?!
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
You don't wanna be noticed?
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES!  JUST DO IT!
That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
I do.
Mr. Wood!
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
What if--you're vomiting?
What if I'm vomiting?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know it.
Excuse me.
Um, yeah -- thanks.
I do.
Yeah?!
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Leave her be.
Ed --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Al!
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
We're falling behind.
Tell me.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
No.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
He says --
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
I'm at the hospital.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
It was horrible. He called me up.
Who?
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
She wouldn't tell me.
Our what?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
No, I mean...
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
You batted or you bunted?
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
So?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
I missed you.
Yeah, well...
That's lucky.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I know, I ...
Look at this.
So?
Where?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
What are you drunk?
Show business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Yeah.
No. What happened?
Ray --
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
We'd better go...
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the cameras here!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Hi, Shari.
It's Ed.
I was in jail.
Check forging.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Sure.
Mm.
That's the point -- this could change things.
What does that have to do with... ?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
Thank you.
Yeah, just --
You guys have fun?
What?
So nice
You're kidding, right?
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
I know.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Okay, fine. Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Good luck, Tracy.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Plenty of pep, too.
Hmm?
Oh.  Okay.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
I did it.
This weekend.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
I don't believe you.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Dave.
Yep.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
And she's super-nice
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
So?
But other people can see them too.
For what?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Do you enjoy it?
But you did it anyway.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
In the morning.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
What?
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
I'm not asking you.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
More's gonna cost you.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Nothing.
I don't have time.  I have --
Man, what're you saying?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
They shot him in his library.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
Gone.  Not a trace.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
The youngest applicant by eight years.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Okay.  I'll do it.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
No.
Not even with Exley?
That's right.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
What?
Just don't shoot me.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
How about White?
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Some reality.
You, me and White, huh?
I know how he feels.
Right now, before I back down.
Where is he?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
I like it!  I like it!
Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
What's wrong, Trash?
A bootleg...
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Yeah.  Me neither.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Working whores with squad two.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
What'd he give to you?
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Clear as day.
I'll come straight there.
I don't know who he is.
Told by whom?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
The NSA?
I don't know what that means.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
And you won't. Now move--
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
One-twenty.
What do you mean?
Look, my wife is understandably--
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
I was a traffic analyst.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Jesus.
They come after you?
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
The NSA killed him.
Why?
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Reynolds.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
Not particularly, no.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Law enforcement?
Oh my God.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
With what?
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Anytime.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Can you help me?
I'll say.
Pardon?
Thanks.
Okay.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
<u>What's</u> your point.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Thanks.  Who are you?
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
About what?
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Yes sir.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Just for the criminals.
Right.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Have you been working with Rachel?
It's not true.
I've seen it.
Yeah...look--
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
I see her for business.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Stacy--
What happened to your head?
Good.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
You opened the thing?
The lingerie.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
It's over.
It's a brand new card.
Here, you can use this.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
That ain't me.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
DePinto?
What answer were you--
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
Tell me about Brill.
It's not me?
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
He didn't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
Fuck off.
Why would the Union--
Why?
Can I open 'em up?
You staying for dinner?
Alright!
What?
They only took electrical appliances.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Why would they--
To the cops?
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
It's been a few years.
Yeah, what's going on?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
I honestly don't know.
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
Fuck you.
There was a transfer.
Dean's with Lyle.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
And if it wasn't?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
Puffed cheese?
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
I don't want to go back.
I don't care to bargain.
Excuse me?
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
You sing.  All the time.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'd like you to have them.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Shall we be all right?
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Don't.
You sew very badly.
Now.
When were you least happy?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
It's a folk song.
You bastard, I was believing you!
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Shall we be all right?
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
You will.  You will.
Dance with me.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
I can't move.  I can't get out.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Still a car.
Appropriate?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
It's Geoffrey under this.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Bermann!
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
Own the desert.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Right.
I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Shut-up!
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
Don't cut me.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
What if I told you he did this to me?
What?  How could he have?  When?
I don't know what that means.
Please don't creep around this house.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
I see.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
No, now I can't kill you.
Oh really?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Well, she is!
Oh.
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
To arm-twisting.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Thank you.
Yes.  Dropping off.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Are you crazy?
He needn't disturb you.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
Hey! -
I love you.
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I don't think so.
Thank you.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
Nya-nya-nya!
Of course.  When?
Kip I -
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
And what if he really is a spy?
He can't even move.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Only we have to go to work.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I had a hotel room.
Go away.
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
What are you talking about?
Why?  Are you German?
I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
I don't recall asking your permission.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Yeah. Me.
Why didn't I think of that?
Which you have in mind.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
I can't?
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
It's not for sale.
Possibly.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Got it.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
And--
Good morning.
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Our equipment has arrived.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Charged?
One more item--not on the check list.
Got it.
What?
Yes. Yes.
It's your mistake.
Get the hell in.
Okay, 80-20--
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You've thought of everything.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Can't be too careful.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
It was wrong to deceive you.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
FUCKING THING!!!
You gave them the eight billion.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
And you do it so well.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Because it pays off.
You damn well thought wrong.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
She's calling the shots now.
To yourself, that's where.
I figured that out.
Yes it does.
Probably not.
That's a joke, right?
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Yes?
You're a lawyer?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Cause of the chromium.
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Any school you want.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
If you hadn't used profanity --
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
I don't get why they'd do that.
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
<u>No</u>.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Gee, I wonder why.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
And, what, I'm not serious?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
No one's taking anything --
And if you had to guess ...
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Why not?
No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
The extortion, the threats ...
I wasn't gonna --
Take it.
Well.  There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.  That I kept instead.
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
How come you're not eating?
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
When?
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
How?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Right.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
I'm gonna clean it up.
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
I didn't say that.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
About what?
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
That's okay.  I understand.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
What's going on?
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Who's Baxter?
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Soon, Lord Vader.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
The boy is our last hope.
No ... there is another.
And that is why I must go.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
What happened?
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Because of my father, I guess.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I have felt it.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
It can wait.
I'm going to see what it is.
Does Luke know?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Forget it.
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
That should do nicely.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
I do not!
Try and control this ...
Where?
Outside, in the cave.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
That depends.  Where are we?
Here ... near the Anoat system.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Are you kidding?
I'll bet.
Hyperdrive.
I'm sorry too.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
Luke?  I don't get it.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
You may call me Leia.
Not really.
I didn't say anything?
What?
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
Oh my, no!
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
Me too.  I was afraid.
He'll survive.
I've never seen it fail.
That is why you fail.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
It is the future you see.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
No!
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
They suggested oranges.
What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes?
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
Humans?
Yes...
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
You told me he was dead.
I thought he was, but he came back.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
All right, so I made another deal.
Dream on, blue eye.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Lock fuel rods.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Delgado?
No way.
We'll see.
Yeah, kinda.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Which way?
Down that way.
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
The what?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
In the great book.
What book is that?
What?!
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
What is it my child?
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
Without Lancelot?!
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
He has given up.
Can it truly be used for magic?
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
You didn't ask!
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Hiding?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
Thank you your excellency.
It's-
I'm sorry.
Hi, how'd your day go?
And you got an invitation.
Dinner at the White House.
Just five or six people.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Of course I didn't.
Storage.
Me too.
It's serious?
We still don't know.
Want to ask him?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
Of course. Have you got a pen?
I just heard them Karl.
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
What!
What man?
Fine thank you.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Never.
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Are you sure?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
I'm Father Karras.
Pretty close.
Sure did.
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
He didn't mention her.
I beg your pardon?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
You could do it yourself...
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Are you sure?
Well I think you should.
Your kidding?
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
Here I'll show you.
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
What?
Okay.
Oh, honey.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Karras.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
Another one. Had your lunch?
No.
Where's Regan?
In here. With us.
Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Holy water.
How's your leg?
Last month.
No.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Amen
O'Lord hear my preyer.
Defender of the human race...
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
What's this about?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Unlikely.
No I probably wouldn't.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
That's to bad.
I've seen it.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Who?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Yes
Just a minute.
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why not?
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
You're not going to drive.
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
Yeah, come on in.
Little slow tonight.
Mondays.
Take it now.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
How will he eat?
No bones?
No.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Count it.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
Yamaha white.  Nice.
Seeing anyone in particular?
So do I.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
You'll see.
What do you mean?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
I don't know what you mean.
No?
No.
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
What?
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
Here, how's this?
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Yeah.  Something.
Just a lucky guess.
Very realistic.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Two years ago.  March.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
Two hours ago!
Time flies, huh?
No. Why?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
She's a big girl.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You could've come.
What do you mean?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Nothing. We get nothing.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Shut up, Frank.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
You weren't there.
Yeah, fine.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
This'll kill 'em.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
All right.
All right.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
We're finished.
You're an hour and a half late.
Miss --
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
That's the premise.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
Where's my name?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
It's orange!
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine.
Uh... good.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Hey!
We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
Hey.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Huh?
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Forget it.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
Uh ... thanks.
Born and bred.
Will I see you again?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Black.  Labrador.
Pretty much.
Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
Every year.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Guess I got a little scattered.
Nothing.
You're upset.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
Soap convention.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
No kidding?
You sending me home?
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
So how's the cat food business?
Huh?
Vegetables.
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Married.
What are they?
The recent past.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
What's a prom?
Yeah?
Sure.
Good to see you, Ma.
None?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
... Thanks.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
My place.
How old is he?
Or reactivated the first one.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
A few blanks?  Like what?
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
For what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
Must've been after we got engaged.
One last time.  It's important ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Don't hang up ...
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
What are you going to do, Castor?
Not if I kill you first ...
Pollux is -- what?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Janie?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You mean like ... condoms?
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Kim?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Just following your example.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
The hospital.
You always say that -- then you leave.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Great.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Excuse me?
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Adelle?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
I don't know.  Maybe...
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
I dont think youre hearing me.
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
I dont know...
On a case by case basis...
Sure.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
Like what?
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Great room...
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Damn, you are the real thing...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Hey...
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Cmon, Jack...
Its lovely...
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
Youre a nurse?
Thanks.  To you too...
Thank you.
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Uh-huh...
I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
HEY!
Whatever you say...honey.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
I want it...
What...?
Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
How do you even know about this place?
Worse, you mean...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Way out...
Its like a museum.
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that.
Its good to see you...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Paris?
Thats the one...
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!
Aspen.
Okay, Ill take them...
You wont regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/As...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
Im sorry, no...
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I like the sound of that.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
He's made a few changes.
<u>Should</u>?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Baby, you're scaring me.
Victor did.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
That's terrible news...
What about you?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Okay, "mom."
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
Then what is it?
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
Front page?
Ben did this.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
If it happened to him, then it could...
Excuse me?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
You <u>were</u>?
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
I gave him twenty.
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
The Other Side got to him.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
You mean <I'm> going along?
As part of the Crew.
Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
Thank you for volunteering.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
I always thought it was nothing but red.
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
A great deal more than that, I believe...
What gives you that idea?
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
What's that?
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Quite a piece of plumbing.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
It's too late!
How are you, Miss Peterson?
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
That makes two of us.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
I'll do what I can.
The Wall's transparent...
May I have your ticket, please?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Certainly -
Certainly.
...What're you talking about?
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
We need more -
...The heck d'ya mean?
Yah, okay, but, uh -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Yah, but that TruCoat -
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, don't be silly.
Yah, right-o.
White Bear Lake?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
You're sayin' - what're you sayin'?
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Yah.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
No, I -
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
but do you know that for sure without -
Yah, but -
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Dad's here.
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
...Yah.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Okay.
Whatcha watchin' there?
I know it's a lot.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Yah.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Well, they -
The heck d'ya mean?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Well - it's cold, Margie.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah - how are you doon?
I see that! That's great!
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Well, they're a good outfit.
I always liked ya so much...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Yep.
Yah, is this Marge?
...Mike Yanagita!
No.
Oh. Oh, my.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
No, no.
Was it reasonable?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Three-cent stamp.
Yah, I guess.
And his wife?
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well -
The first rule of Project --
Right, right.
He was killed in action.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Have you finished those reports?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
No, I wasn't aware...
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
Who do you think could've done this?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
I don't know -- am I?
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
Deal.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
That's the idea -- we split them.
Like testicular cancer?
What... ?
It suits you.
Please.
You feel nothing?
Well... thanks, anyway.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
I don't know.
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
... A person.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
You're afraid to say.
What?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Say my name.
Marla, no, wait...
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
What?
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Who's this?
Tyler?
... You know me?
Yes... it's a test.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
Pardon me?
Thank you.
This is how we fill up our lives.
All gone.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
What list?
I don't... think so.
A hotel?
No, I...
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Can I stay at your place?
Thank you.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
You get the idea.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Surprise me.
Like hell.  That counted.
My dad.  No question.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
Same here.
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Okay.
Promise you won't.
Uh... nah...
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
I don't know...
We don't need him...
Work.  Going to work.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I don't think that's true.
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
... is over.
... is over.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
I don't know!  Tell me!
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
You... you can't be serious about this.
Stop finishing...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Not exactly according to plan.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Noooo, please...
Why are you doing this?!
I'm doing this for us.
I swear on my life, I won't...
My eyes are open.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Very good, Sir.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Well, sir, you said you might.
But, this is Project Mayhem.
Robert Paulson?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Let go of me!!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Yeah, how?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
So let's do it.
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
I have to save Eugene!
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Taken care of.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
That lucky bastard.
What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Blow me.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
...My Premonition was just like his.
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
I know how it feels to be dead.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
I know.  I can feel it too.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I know, Dad.
What feeling?
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
"It?"
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
Then, let's go see him!
As in flannels and plaids?
Like... 4:25.
Nothing is... anymore.
No!
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
That's a plan.
No. I saw it. I saw it!
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
In Death...
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
What's that?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Batteries not included.
I had it cupped.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
American?
Nothing we can do, man.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
What... whattaya do?
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
Forget it.
Intelligence work.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Why'd they want us?
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Let's go.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
How?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
That's an order.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
Where?
What's the plan?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
He... took it.
Nice work.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
Have fun.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.
Colonel.
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
Those men are all dead.
Yeah.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
No, thank you.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
<u>What</u>!
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
And who's Lydia?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
I... You're not going to understand this.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
He just needs some clothes?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
No.
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I was nine in the sixties.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Huh-huh.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
<u>What</u>?!
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
The Little...
But I can't get it... He's...
Fifty dollars?
You really want to help me?
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
So what? You going to help me?
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
Yes. I think that's very fair.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
Fuck you.
OWW...MAN...
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
It sounds exciting.
There isn't any more to tell.
You don't have to say that.
I don't drink coffee...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
You're married.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
No, dammit, I would easy.
You got another ball comin'.
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
You just going to sit there?
I hope they do.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
You'll be gone, period.
Sure...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
I don't know.
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
No.
Palm Apodaca.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
No. How much do I owe you?
No. We have tomatoes.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
That's good.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Very nice.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Who's Van Oost?
No...
All right...
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
Sometimes.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
There's nothing to say, Tita...
With applesauce?
No, thanks...
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
But what about me?
I guess you fell in the water.
That's dangerous, you know.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Why?
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
The day after tomorrow.
I gave it a second thought.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Why?
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
I didn't have any.
I don't think that's accurate...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
Yes, that's what's important to me...
Shut up...
That's right.
I'm fine.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Yes.
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
Is she?
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
No, it's okay.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
It is true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I hope I didn't hear that.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
Well, I should hope not...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Pardon me?
Well, she was.
Perhaps...
Look at me.
Why you have an attitude for?
Not now, I'm busy
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Just get the fuck outta here.
Is it true?
Victor.
Nothin'.
No.  What you do today?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
A play-ya.
How you treat them?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I got punished, man.
I can't man, I'm punished!
Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
Which one?
You know, Eddie's cousin.
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You said before, that he got boxes?
A girl named Amanda.
Positive.
Your friend must be misinformed.
I'm a good friend of hers.
Not really.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You're kidding.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Nineteen.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Can I ask anybody now?
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
We play tennis at the club.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
I don't know. I don't have any.
Mrs. Smith.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Just relax.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
Fletch...
The two surfer boys?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
You don't have a piece of the action?
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Nothing. They're still there.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Oh my God!
That's it?
He'll be so relieved.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Of course.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Harry S. Truman?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Course he has. That's his wife.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
You sure did.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
I know. I got bad luck or something.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
I'm all ears.
Why don't you try suicide?
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
I have the same problem with my help.
In this drawer....
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Sure, all drifters do.
You sure got the hard part.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Deal.
Maybe.
Nothing to it.
You've met her?
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John! You used to fly together!
Preoccupied with what?
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I love the outfits.
I bet you do.
See what I mean?
Down boy.
God...
No. He was. I got him out.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
How do you know about that?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
You saw a forgery.
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I was afraid you'd say that.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
Don't tell me I can't --
They're trying to kill me!
I want to hear this.
They just left, sir.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
In her cabana, sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Muchas gracias.
Sierra del fuego.
What?
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
What?
I commend him on his choice
Moved out.
She moved out.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
...never reads the paper...
I don't know.  Look!
Looks great.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
How gray?
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Get out of here.
Print this Frank.
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
You were going to can me, right?
Not really?
Yeah.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
In a minute!
I said, I ain't got you...
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
Excuse me?
Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
No prob...
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Make eye contact when you say that.
You're not funny.
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
Johnny's C.D.?
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Are you okay?
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Ye-ah.  Sure.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Ye-ah.
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Forget it.
Who cares?  I got a case.
Twelve pack?
Did he just say what I think he said?
I don't need it that bad.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Like me.
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Go on, another time, another place.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Are you okay?
Fuck me...
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
No - no.
Cause if I do.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Who brings it?
Where do you want it?
This side.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Yeah?
No... yeah...
Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
Goodbye.
It's your problem.
Pour moi?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de srenit. Elle m'a demand de tes nouvelles et si nous tions heureux.
Non!
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
S'right.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Marseilles.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
You want some eggs.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Yeah!
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Never trust a nigger.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Suspicion of what?
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Yeah.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Pour it in your ear.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Hiya, Jesus.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Darling, may I have this one?
What was it?
For dead bodies.
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Well, why not a little of the King?
Did he?
Do you know how much I love you?
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I know.  He loves that thing.
About what?
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Glad to hear that.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
What it was like when you died in the fire...
Are you alright"?
She just died, your mother just died?
Whatta you mean...
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
You there?
H-hi.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Dad, you there?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
What the hell is that smell?
Huh?
How'd you know my name, mister?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Yeah.  That's it.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
What?
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Yeah, that's right.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I hear that.
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
Not now.  I'm cold.
If you insist.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I vote for me.
I vote for the hammock.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Yes, man!
This is all the exercise I need...
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Will you come with me?
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
You go ahead...
Hello.  How are you?
Is that so bad?
Did you stay here last night?
Are you all right, Shelly?
It's deceiving.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
You promised you'd never ask me.
My whole world.
Stick around and you'll see.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Keep looking.
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
It was nothing.
Don't say any more.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
Come and get it.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Why?
That's debatable.
He didn't say anything?
There's no time for this bullshit...
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I've seen it.
Yes.
Save your...
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
You food'll be right out.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
I know everything about you, Diana.
So's he and he knows it.
Get up!
Goddamnit!
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Oh my God, Steven.
Randy, c'mon!
Don't do anything stupid.
Okay.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
-- Bad?!
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
But she might be in trouble...
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
Not another word, do you hear me??
We have to get off this ship!!
They're out of town.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
Walking corpses are not real!
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
He is not.
I'm staying.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Really?
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
Yeah...a lot.
There's something I haven't told you...
After your parents passed away?
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
What is your location?
I...I don't know...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
What do you mean???
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Where you're going, mister?
Very big.
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
Very bad today.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Ruptured steam pipe.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Press a button and they give us money.
She wants a divorce.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Do not inhale.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What happened eighteen months ago?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
You say we go?
Here we go.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What?
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
What are you talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
This could be it.
What about her?
She's dying.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
The Red Sox
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
In and out of bed.
Why do you need a radio?
Is it?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Opening night?
Everything.
It's only our first date.
A flat-out hit.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
It's your best play, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
Who the hell cares?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Joanne Bourne.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
Washed away.
One more out.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
You know the answer to that.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Since when did that matter?
What do you want me to do?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Matthew's my grandson.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
I want to believe.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
Yes.
Mine was cobalt blue.
Yes.
There was a review.
A little.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
So do I. Over and over.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Is it true?
Someone waiting for you?
No one's waiting.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
I don't want you, Steven.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
"Hell!"
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
You will respect the law.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
No.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
There is nothing I can give.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
Ahh.
I congratulate them.
Who's leading them?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Have you found him?
There are a few million miles to go yet.
It's for the best.
Now is your chance to find out.
Er, no...
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I'll take care of it.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
We don't have the manpower.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Where do we start?
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
Often.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
It's about the Director.
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
He's too tall.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
What about this?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
You wish.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
You know I'm scared of heights.
It's okay, Eugene.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
What are you talking about?
They found my eyelash.
I'm sure I could have.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
How the hell did you get here.
Where are you going?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Antonio, the choir...
German, is that you?
How do I square the accident?
That's the hair color in his profile?
You worried about the cost?
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why would we do that?
We were just looking.
Where?
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
Not like <i>this</i> one.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
I bet.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
It looks fine.
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I've been doing my homework.
Where did you get them developed?
Fatter... some things never change.
Boring.
No. It's been a long time.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
You were asleep.
Suit yourself.
You got the parole, didn't you?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
My mind's not on guessing games.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
And switched keys.
He must have.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Texas is a big state.
I can handle it.
Like what?
When are you going to learn?
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Sure...
I don't want to hear it.
No more about Beynon.
Whatever happens it's over.
You want to try with me?
Can we make it?
What's wrong?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
What about you?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I'm good at that.
Whatever you need.
Dillinger got killed.
Just sandwiches...
Then you do it.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Sure am.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Just... tell us what you want.
Two years.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
How?
Who?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What happened to this car?
Was he?
I know.
Well?
Never mind.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Why?
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
What about?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Why'd you see him so regular?
I work for him.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
Really?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
So where are we going, Princess?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Sure I'm sure.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Expect so.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
That must be interesting.
What?
Did you work with him, Keith?
At the Half Moon.
Why would it?
Yes.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Nowt.
Where you off to?
How many?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
I'm sorry.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Ta-ra.
Don't ask me.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What, and get myself beaten up again?
And that'll make me feel better?
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Sod off.
Still got your sense of humour.
I have to. Things to see to.
What for? Protective purposes?
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
What? And get the clap?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
You're not seeing me?
No.
Deadbeats all.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
Mmm...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
Some contest board...
No.
That's right?
No.  That's absolutely right.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
With River Oaks?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
What?
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's what I...
When they...
What?
Someone should stand up and strike back.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
No, we're just...
We're just "talking" about it.
Yes.
We're not actually talking about it.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
What did you say?
We are?
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
Why would they come to me?
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
That's ridiculous.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Do you need five grand?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
Because you listened.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
That's...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
...what am I going to do all month...
To the cops?
Yeah.
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Why don't you think so?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
No.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
They're inured to it.
Did they catch...?
We had a robbery. 
Go to lunch, will you...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Excuse me...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Excuse me, sir...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Would you excuse us, please.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
Get in the goddamn room.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...no...
...I only...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Yes.
Murray said...
...ah, fuck this...
Yes.
They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
What if you don't close...?
Not lately you can't...
Good.  Now we're talking.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I can't do it, Shelly...
Somebody broke in.
Get 'em to me!
Did you tell 'em my sale?
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
What does that fucking mean?
On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
Yes.  I hear you.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
Well, hadn't it?
You robbed the office.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Mmm.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
Abso...
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
What does that mean?
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
You bet your ass.  Who wants to go to lunch?  Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying.  Eighty-two fucking grand.  And twelve grand in commission.  John.  On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads.
That's right.
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: "Now is the time."  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together. 
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
What is it?
Kenilw...
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Sure.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
The monthly interview...?
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Lingk.  James Lingk.
My wife...
Who did she call?
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
The check wasn't cashed?
It's not me, it's my wife.
Tell me again.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She won't listen.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
I...
This.
And the check is...
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
Not to my knowledge, no...
You hear what I said?
I'm going home.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They got, listen to me...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. 
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
They were friends.
No, where is it?
I can't.
To do business.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
We have no money for a rug.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
How are the kids?
Because I need MONEY!
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
He's the head of the family.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you...
The child cannot harm you.
Yeah, some deal I made.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
Beautiful.
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
Within the compound will be fine.
I'm going to see my parents.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Mike, at three and a half...
I want it met.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
Good.  Then you're staying.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
No questions.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Tom, what do I do now?
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Yes, Michael.
Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
Michael.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
No, I meant lose his family.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
No, I'm fine.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
Let him gamble.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
I know.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Keep them alive.
No, she's here.
Are we going to eat or what?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
We got no choice.
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
It never crossed your mind?
Tea is fine.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
No!
But I didn't do this!
And your name is --?
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
No.  I'm fine.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
What?
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
All right, I guess.
Go ahead.
Did anyone laugh?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
No.  I could have, though.
I'm not, you know.
Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Not at the moment.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You were a soldier?
I didn't --
You're the one who started it.
No harm done.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
No.  The girl.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
I see.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
What happened?
I'm very sorry.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Your friend?
You are much too human.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
You're crazy.
Need some help?
Ooooh.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
I just want to watch it, okay?
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
Then take the pills.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Hanna.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
More your line.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Elsa?
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Yes?
She is beautiful.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
Then the rumors are true?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Righto.  Let me see.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
You think so?  That's very kind --
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Don't go away.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
A boost. A big boost ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...

How ya doing?
I'm just here about my brother.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
No...
You know my back.
Consider me gone, Detective --
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
Right ...
Well, that defies the point, don't it?
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...

I think so too --
No.

I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
What do you say, Toby?,
Yeah ...
Sure --
Something like that -
What do you got ... ?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
I can see that -
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
He's gonna kill you -- !

Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
What? What happened?
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
What?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Liar!
What bag?
How much?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
What did he say, exactly?
Just get me out.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
What?
It's been six months.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Nah.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Tommy  ...
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
I don't want them left back.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
Yeah.
Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Least I work for a livin'.  Why'd you get fired?
All right, then.
What are we gonna do up there?
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Ah, history I think.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Shut the fuck up.
Good, it was all right.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
And what do you see?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Building two.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
That you meet with me twice a week--
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
Okay. How?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
That's enough.
I don't know what it's called.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
Yeah, cured polio.
So who won the bet?
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
I do.
Well, you're the only one.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Oh, come on, Sean--
--I'm not angry at you--
He's not you!
Sean...
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I don't know. India maybe.
Never been.
I got one of those too.
About thirty million to one.
About thirty million to one.
What's the point?
He was my roommate in college.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Hold up.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
How about the ones on that shelf?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
You think so?
Oh.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
What is?
Time's up.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Fine.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Hence, the word remarried.
Why not?
Yeah.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
When did you know she was the one?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
That's right.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
What did I think?
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
--No, have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
I know.
I know.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'll keep in touch.
Good luck.
What?
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Okay, sounds good.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Yes you were.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Do you keep in touch with them?
We'll do that.
I'm supposed to understand this.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
They don't come over here that much.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Some, a little.
Like me?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
I never knowed they was anything like her!
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Sure. Why not?
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Joad.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Which way is House 25?
Deputy sheriffs.
Got a warrant?
How many of you?
*You* find out, I can't.
Why, you're the preacher!
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Casy! What you doin' here?
I aim to.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Can't you see that sticker?
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Get to what?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
You ain't got to get sore.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
This here's a strike.
Yes, ma'am.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No plants.
I'll walk back.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
No--an' look what I got for you.
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Didn' you get no sleep?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
But who done it?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Won't they come out here?
California, here we come!
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
We gonna take whatever they got.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
You do not see either!--not yet!
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. 
Whatsa matter?
I never--
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
I'm Martin Blank.
Whatever I can get away with.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
What?
It's me. Martin Blank.
Then express yourself, Bob.
Insane.
It's nice to see you again.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Bad experiences.
You're fucking psycho.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Could be. The physical substance of love.
No.
Is it something you've done?
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I'll hide.
Other people can't.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Yes.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Do you like the people you work with?
I work alone.
Okay.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Hard to get good help these days.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
Okay.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
Lisbon?
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Wait a minute--
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
One cannot love and kill.
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
I'll pay.
I'm not happy.
In Detroit. This weekend.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
Will do.
What's a revival tent?
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
You're leaving me hanging here...
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
All by yourself?
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
That's up to Pilgrim.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
You lived in Chicago?
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Just who's been laughing at who here?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
You too.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Feel good?
Yeah.
Five years. My son was born here.
Son?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
I don't care! We'd be together.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Why?
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Mom?
Maybe they should put me down too.
I didn't know I had to.
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
Then why do you want to leave?
No, you just act like you do.
Did he mention it?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
Well, one was for salad...
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Thanks, honey.
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Why should they?
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Go ahead...
Yes. We're suing.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Tch. What are you --
We're very lucky.
Okay.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
What did he say?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
And you think it's best if I don't come.
When are you coming home?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Night.
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Take your time.
What do you mean?
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
I was there for that shot, actually.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
You don't seem to upset?
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Promise.
Well, of course, right...
It isn't right to make him suffer...
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
Ain't brain surgery.
That's what some folks say.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
You know, you're a good kid.
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
I don't have all day.
I don't know if I can.
I just could never say it!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
NO!
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
We still have a way to go.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
How long were you married?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
What stuff is that?
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
Don't move!
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Shh!
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Again?  Yeah sure.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
That's far out!
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
I'm gonna hit you!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yo, hit the lights.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
Curtis.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
What are you doing?
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
And unpack.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Blow me.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Give it up! Just give it up.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
No.
How did you know that?
What's this one eat?
Fucked if I care, man.
No, you're not in my class.
Yeah! Sure.
I'll give it a shot.
I said give me time.
I'm Crash Override.
It's too much machine for you.
Yeah?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Name your stakes.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Make it my first born.
And you have to smile.
I'm sorry, I can't.
What?
You what?
I'll make it up to you!
I'll hack the Gibson.
It's my subway defense system.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Yeah.
Alright, let's boot up.
I'm trying to help you.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Gill.
We caught 'em.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Phreak?
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
555-4202.
You're late.
I'll take you down there.
All right.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
When did you find this out?
So?
No, you don't understand.
Who's that?
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Go!
An accident?
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
How do you know their not?
About what?
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
I do.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
No way. No how.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
I can't sleep.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Double scoops?
In a second.
I thought you said you were ready.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we'll be safe?
No.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
All right.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Okay, bye.
Right here, Ben.
This is 132, over.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
He's here, Sheriff.
Why?
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
He's been here.
How do you know?
Dear God.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
Don't touch him Jamie!
What?
What happened?
Huh?
He shouts, too.
Fun-ny. See you.
The guys think I'm too smart.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
He can still watch.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Here, Lester.
Come with me.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Yeah.
They may be right.
Could have...
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
Where?
I don't think so...
Totally.
Is Annie around?
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Sure.
Sure. Sure.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
There is no such thing.
There WAS.
The bogyman!
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Yes.
Let's make more popcorn.
Okay.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
If you say so.
What does that mean?
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
I can't believe it!
Yeah.
You want to see some?
Uh --
Great.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Right.
Yeah.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
No, he called late last night.
And you, you-you're going?
Right.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
And it ruins everything else.
It does.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Yeah?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
I don't know exactly.
Hi.
Yes, I do.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Oh, God.
Yeah, you would.
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
No!  No...
No, I don't think so.
Well, sure.
Bye.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Did you ever read this one--?
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Why?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Lee... uh...
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I know it isn't.
Is something wrong?
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
I know.
Mmm.
It's so late.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
You're not lost.
This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
Always.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Oh, honey!
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Yeah.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
Stop accusing me!
I'm sorry.
I'm saying it now!
Yeah.
Jesus...Jesus!
But not you.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Yes, please.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Come on.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
No.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Really?
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Yeah?
I think we need to eat.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
Yeah?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Thanks, thanks.
Mh-hm.
Isn't that great?
Well, then a third opinion.
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
What are you talking about?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Oh, sure.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Yeah.
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
She really does, though.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
It's, uh, you never know--
He's not a loser at all!
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Look, everything's going your way.
So what's new?
You got it.
Yeah, that's clerical.
How?
You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
What's the matter?
Good.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yes, you do recall, right?
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Yeah.
Good.  How are you?
Oh, no.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
People change...you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Probably not.
Have you?
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
...which I did not get.
April?
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Some museum director disappeared.
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
We could skip the Gavotte.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Then I'm doing fine.
I know her by the Back.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Seen what, sir..?
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
I've never heard that he...
I won't take much of his time.
What reaction?
Try Barney Clark.
No, no, of course not.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Mmm...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
....what...? 
For a consideration.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
...what's he got against you?
You seen John Brigham...?
A fellow with five fingers.
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
No. 
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
What'd you say, hon...?
How's your <u>child</u>?
Waal...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
A wonderful country...
You know it?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
...yes.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  <u>History</u>, a hazardous profession.
I have had the honor. 
Enchante.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
We got KittyKat...
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
You were given backup....
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
Every suicide kills two.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...and that is what you need to expand.
...what do you expect me to...
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
And why should we believe you?
What shape is the scar?
The shape of a Three.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
Thank you.
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
I know it well.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
Then what brings you back?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
I don't understand.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
You guys have been so colossal...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...

Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
I think your passion is terrific.
I think your condescension is even better.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
Don't worry, you...
Do you really think I care?
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week.

That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
Don't get cocky, girl.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
You're beautiful.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
Like last night, Veronica?
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Don't think.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
No. Hell no.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
Sure.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I didn't. Cherry.
S'okay....
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Chick-en.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Oh.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Remember he's left-handed.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
You didn't say Simon Says.
What?
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Get a job.
But my name's not...
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
What now?
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Who cares!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
looks startled at the outburst.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Somebody's got to help us!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
Saint Mario!
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
All right, then.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Your wife...?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
All finished.
I understand, I think. Other women?
I did more then that.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Getting paid for doing shit.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
What's the difference?
Zero's a number right?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
Really? Why?
Really, why's that?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Thanks.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
A little? Try unbelievably.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Ambulance.
This game is over do you hear me?
Well now there's a compliment.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
Allen?  He... he's okay?
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
It's November.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
Mister LaPlante...
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
Bill, listen...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Me!
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
Goodnight, John.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Bodybuilding!
John, I know all about it.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
You're sitting on your ticket.
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Dad!
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
How are they with kids?
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Let's watch some TV.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And the rent is okay?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
I should.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Do you do washing machines, too?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
You must value your independence.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Uh huh.
I think we should talk first.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Aw, okay.
A man scared me.
Did Daddy tease you?
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
So you don't have anything concrete?
Have you just plain asked him?
And?
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
Here, take this out to the table.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
RUDOLF!
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
What's that?
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Oh baby.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
There might be some extras in the garage.
I think it's time I came home now.
Isn't it?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
I have a cold.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Even better.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Uh huh.
Not now.  I'm busy.
They appear to be authentic.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
What is it?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Tough.
We don't have any proof of that.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Central Park.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No.
No.
Get outta here.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
I hear you.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Maybe myself.
For what?
As friends -- always as friends.
If it came down to it what would you do?
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
How long is the voyage?
No.  What am I to do?
It's done.
You always get to go first.
She'll soon be of age.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
I would like to say goodbye.
How?
The past?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Why not?
I'm leaving in the morning.
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Then how did he know your name?
New York is dangerous place.
Sorry.
I've lived all over the world.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
Is it?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Not unless they're immortal.
On the back it has--
And the other one -- he is like you?
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
What?  How?
This cannot be.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
I guess so.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.
What do you want to do?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I understand.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
It's happening right now.
I guess not.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
Bullshit!
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
What are you talking about?
I'm not going to die for this!
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Give up.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
We're trapped in a house.
I don't know.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Keeps to himself, more like.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
You said they would be here!
Where is it?
You'd better be kidding.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
I'm not gonna leave you!
I know.
We can't make the microwave work.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stop it.
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
He said something about a girl --
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Get a phone number for the Smiths.
Go, Chief.
I know the one.
She didn't answer.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Yes, sir.
Are all of you named Jones?
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
Not until the man calls.
Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
These disks . . . where are they?
Smith will know.
We, who is we?
A delegation.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
Leave it to me.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Yes we have.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
Canadian Club?
They're only taking the whites.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
The high command? Our high command?
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
What do you mean, General?
When?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
How so.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Very good.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Give me the phone.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
This goes out live?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Why sir?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
Our cards, please.
How much?
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I will see what I can do.
How do you know?
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
They do not have your connections.
Jean Baptiste!
Murdered! By whom?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
They know you are Tutsi!
Dawn. Then they go.
I'll try.
Give him time.
We have been abandoned.
But who is left?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
A car.
No! Sit down now.
I have to go to the Diplomat.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
There is one thing I need right away.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
That is why they call it coach?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
The staff and guests! How many?
Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
On the street.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
And what's Steven's status?
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
-- bullshit --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
I'm moved beyond words.
Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
Oh dear.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Three times, to be exact.
I don't know!!
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Yeah, me too.
And I think that's case --
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Nothing.
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
Yes.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
Prove it.
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- yeah, we did that --
Don't push it.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
Why not?
There's always exceptions.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
That's crazy!
It's succeeding!
What --
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
-- the sadistic prick --
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- and who's next on your list?
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
Steven??
What?
And here's your goddamn severance!
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
What?
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
-- confirming everything we already know --
Believe me, we need to.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
How, he's supposed to be dead!
Over here.
For the love of God....please...?
We don't have proof of that.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
A few years older, perhaps.
By freeing them.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Well I bet you they're happy.
Well then who did?!
Ok...
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
She's here.
Take me to her.
Why?
I just, I don't know...
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
What?
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
So what are you saying?
Well what do you think it is?
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
No...  NO!
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
What about the other five percent?
Oh, that's nice...
It was a shame.
In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
What!
The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
The amulet...
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Runic?
Then tell me what to do.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
I'll do it!
Every day.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Would you know this store again?
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Can we see?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Unh-unh.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
But how in God's name ...
Yeah really.  I'm ...
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
You're not...LISTENING!
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
But I said I was sorry....
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
You sound disappointed.
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Yes way.
Last rites, sister?
A little petting is not the issue!
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
God go with you, sister.
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Uh....old badminton injury.
The C.I. what?  God, no...
This is too bad to be false.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
I don't care.
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Alchemy.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Just shut up and hit me!
Too bad.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Shucks.  Guess not.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Tell me about it...
The Jerky Circle!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Lumbago.
He didn't offer you money.
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Mind if I join you?
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
You don't say.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
What a beautiful thought.
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Now, Aim --
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
Watch it, Archer --
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
Terrific.
Ya know, entry level!
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
This you're familia' with.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
An example must be made!
...It is?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yessir.
Yes sir...
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
I haven't had --
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Sir, my leg is on fire!
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Ya don't say.
She sits down.
The mark notices.
Hello, Niagara.
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Ti-Joseph?
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I've never heard of a cure.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Where were you trained?
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
But it's so far away...
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
But she's not dead, Wes.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
Good morning.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I love Fort Holland.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
She was beautiful.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
Investigation of what?
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Up the organization!  Bastard.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
So maybe you'll come too?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Good night.
Rough day. Good night.
Hmm. Good night.
Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
No advice from the experts, huh?
You think I --
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
What do you mean?
I'm not surprised.
It's a starting place.
If you're going to insult me --
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
I'm fine dad.
Sure dad.
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
Yeah?
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Nothing.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Thanks for the advice Dave.
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Who?
Mikey Williams?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
It's not a bother.
How'd you know?
That's right.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
See ya.
What do you mean?
Shit. You're not planning --
All will be revealed, baby.
One for you and one for me.
Let's see!
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Truly? Do speak.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
No one.
Then why'd you come after me?
There's a TV in the basement.
I don't know.
I don't know.
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
The ones you built?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah.
Just thought I'd stop by.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Vodka?
Good.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
Too bad...
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Don't worry about him...
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Byrd's dead.
Where is he?
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
First I need a copy of the key.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
Did she?
That boyfriend.  Randy.
Seven years.
Even the best make mistakes.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Ran like hell to go to him...
You don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Best friend?
That's a long time.
Long as it's fun.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
Who?
Who?
But she was an attractive girl.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Drop the gun, Walter.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
No.
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
No, my beloved, my child.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
Yes... My God...
I can't save her.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
But you're the fairest by far.
And if I cut my hair again?
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
What plans?
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
I took your life. He gave you another one.
The swamp...
I can't. Go away from me.
And you never cried -
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
And no one knows but us...
Be still!
What danger?
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Never.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
Then my luck would have changed.
NO!!!!!
How do you mean, start?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Yes...
Dying?
Read her thoughts.
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
No...
That and more.
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
CLAUDIA!!!
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
You followed me here, didn't you?
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
You can't look at them...
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
No.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
No.
Okay, okay. You're right.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I've got to see.
Then, we fight --
...Nancy?
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Never do that again.
It's gonna be great.
You know me to well.
Fine. Show me the body.
Right. Now I remember.
I'm okay.
Deep breaths --
What do you mean, Julie?
It's in my room!
I wasn't dreaming.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
I don't know, but I'm starving.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
How much?
Not anymore.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
So why are you still here?
How's the water?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
You collect these to sell, abroad?
Drunk again?
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
In case you do so, would you --
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
Well 
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
Poor Cathy --
Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I don't know now without my father.
She has never mentioned her family.
I was looking for you.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
They shall not hurt you
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell 
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Theodosia.
Her family name?
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
I can't understand that.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
We still don't know that it's the plague 
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
Come - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
He hates all my race.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
I'm hurrying.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Suicide.
Oh, no.
Angel, Second Class.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
No, of course not.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Well, wait and see.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
They went out of business years ago.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Mother . . .
Today, over at the house.
Well, what happened to you?
I won a flower.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
No charge.
I'm all right.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Uh-huh.
No.
Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
Hope you enjoy it.
Oh . . .
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
How's that?
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Very funny. Very funny.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Say, where's Mother?
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
All of it?
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
This way.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
You like it? I'll send you a box.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Five hundred dollars.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Okay  what can we lose?
Beautiful.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
In that place?
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Tuesday.
Do you like it?
Mary . . .
You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar  the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
That does it  come here.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Thanks for dropping around.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
I've eaten.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Huh?
You going to the lighthouse?
What the hell.  For you....
How fast is enough?
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
I'm supposed to.
Stop paddling!
Back down!
Good.  It's terrible.
Yeah.
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We're hung up on something.
Want to swim home?
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Positive I.D.?
You got it.
Not the drugstore!
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Please.  It's my job.
Sailing?
Not till next year.
You said something about a camera.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
All of us thank you, okay?
Too late, it's written.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
The Shark's mouth.
What shark?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Okay, so that's it.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
So there's one around here.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
What're you guys doing today?
It's an island.  Got to run.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Terrific.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
What'd I say?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
I'll give notice.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Just one minute....
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
What for?
That's it?
Sure they did....
That's you.
I've never been supercargo.
Now I really want to see it.
Great.
Help!  Help!
I know.
What's that mean?
Just like this.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
What Kids?  Who went out?
Mike?  Our Mike?
Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
Until we find something.
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
What the hell is it?
Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!
What about me?
You always go with Andy.
Maybe.
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Sure am.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Pre-opening jitters.
I guess.
How come?
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Get out of here!
Hi, baby.
... Friggin' fish.
I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Here.
Bracelets.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Sean, that's right...
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
Okay.
... Mean through the tubes?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Yes, you can.
It's a shark's tooth!
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
You don't have to prove anything.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Fine.  Have them do some.
I told you, something's upset them.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
No!
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Just watch it when he does.
Why are you?
She, Mister Hutton.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
Thanks.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
You like Florida?
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
Sure am.
As always.
Yes, it's great!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Now what's this do?
What, hon?
SEAN!
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Now what?
It's disappeared.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
No, South Georgia.
What the hell's there?
The world's southern most reaches.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Look great, don't I?
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
That's Dad...
Gee, it's good to see you!
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Tell Matt he should be here....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
I don't know...You...I don't know.
I have work....
But it went away...We would have known....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I'm not on vacation....
I like it.  Really....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
It's beginning....
Whatever happens next.....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
He knows what he has to do....
That....
I'm not doing anything.
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
Can't help myself....
I'm hungry, Mom....
What's going on?
You're silly....
Who's coming?
I'll miss you....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
I'm fine....
Good.  So will I....
I'm not going to quit now....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
No.
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
It could have been an accident....
You're impossible....
No, you're not....
I'm terrific... Come on....
A big one....
No!
But it gets cold in winter....
You're always taking time off....
Why?
I'm sorry...I....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
She said it was coming....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
She's a tough lady....
Feathers all over the place....
Try the area around the wreck....
You tagging them...?
They won't fight with me....
I didn't do it on purpose....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
Holy shit!
Down here....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
The shark will get it for us.
Who?
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I don't like it....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Shove it....
It'll work....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
In a few minutes....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Cow tipping?
Yeah?
The van?
How about any guys on your staff?
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
The <u>dogs</u>?
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Not too good in daylight ..
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
Someone bet me a dollar ..
So am I. But where's my money?
To throw out of the window.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Car accident.
John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Now?
It's twenty of three.
You ain't going in alone?
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
What are you looking for?
Vehicle references.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
He ain't offerin me shit.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Why not? You heard my voice?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
No, it has a mind of its own.
Yes.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Hamlet. Have you read it?
You should. It's wonderful.
Oh.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
No I'm not.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
You do?
I'm blind because my father drank.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Two or three years ago.
What does that mean?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
A derelict.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Jerry!  Do something --
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Listen to me, it's over.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Bill, Rod, wait --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Now what did you lose?
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
You think so?
Oh tsht. Yes.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Happy for us.
Thanks.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Good evening.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
Let's not tell our sad stories.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
You want...
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Ten seconds, Rod.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
I'm sorry, I --
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Let's do it again.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
I might call you later!
Very much.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
I understand your anxiety.
No, I air-dry.
You.
No tell me. _ 84.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
No.
I'm a little worried --
I'm asking you a question --
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
Fine.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Gorgeous.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
What is it?
A bird cage.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
What?
What's a bad idea?
Oh, don't worry about that.
Nothing.
Eric!
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
He could have died.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
He loves you too.
I thought you were an expert.
Sure.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
That does sound lucky.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
They never got that big.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
The last of my breed.
In Costa Rica?
Which one do you prefer?
What did you think?
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Why?
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Something must've scared them.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
But you never came across just one.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
No.  I feel something.
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
-- my --
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
I don't even know this woman.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Well, is he?
That Richard.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
I'm fine... I'm fine...
The velociraptors.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
You version of it.
Our chance to do what?
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
No way.
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
What's that?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
Funded by whom?
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
What?
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
Can the kid walk?
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
How am I supposed to transport them?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Dilophosaurus.
It's my favorite.
I know.
Not just every six weeks.
- - barfs them up - -
You can't hold it by yourself!
No, no, no!
The other car!
Okay.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Oh, imperfections?
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Please - - chance it.
- - shut up.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
Are they heavy?
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Listen, ahh - -
Tim.
Really?
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
"Thunder lizard!"
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You have no idea.
Why?
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Kids get scared.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
You're sure?!
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
He left us!  He left us!
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
Oh, I hate the other kind.
I'll stay awake.
Please!
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Yes.
Don't do that!
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
We love the presents.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
That was great!
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
That's not true...
Get rid of them.
I think we're lost.
I really think we should go back...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
He... he's here...
Who's there?
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Who's chest?
Video store?
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
He wets the bed?
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
That's open to debate.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Uh-huh...
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
Think it'll do any good?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
About ten minutes.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
Up there.
What is it really?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
Success or nothing?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Then its authority is in doubt.
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
I usually take lunch by the River.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Yes.
I suspected that he -- well.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
They're not obliged to tell.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
You mean you've actually begun some?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
-- You should meet my father.
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
You look tired.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
Amerika for us!
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
I photographed it extensively, father.
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
No! Don't!
You're the animals - all of you!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
Native costume?
That's too bad.
What was it, Jack?
That's your monkey, Denham.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
What?
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Why?
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Did he come around often?
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Mm.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
-- We can talk --
Will you let me go then?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Why?
Mm.
Mm.
Could I ask some questions?
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
-- OK --
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
No thanks.
Is that what you gave him?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Well -- she's dead.
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways. 
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
You said it was!
Well --
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
Why?
I don't get you.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
I don't like getting splashed.
What am I supposed to say?
Don't touch anything.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Mm.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
You wanted to, or you are?
I don't think so.
OK.
No. I'm sore.
I better keep looking.
How is it back there?
Well there's a couple --
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
What's in it?
All right.
I've just got a few --
She told me.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
Has she talked with you since prison?
No.
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Playing.
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Show.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad?
Uh huh...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
No!
I want my mommy...I want my mommy..
I'm sorry...
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I love you...
See you in the morning light...
Sure.
Is that really your chair?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
What did you do when you were little?
Was there Burger King?
Like a principal?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Yes, your honor.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
I do not, your honor, however--
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Six years.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
Was he unfaithful?
I suppose...
How long was that?
I consider it less my failure than his.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I don't know...
You have?
You've been living here, in the city?
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Sure.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Fine.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Six.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I lost him?  I lost him?
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
I don't know.
Ten.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
You're on your own, understand?
I understand.
I'm sure.
Slow down...Slow down...
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What d'you tell her?
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him.  I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you.  You're a good mother.
You and Charley?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Kham, Holiness.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Can I do anything I want?
But, I am in charge.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Hmmm.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
I will not approve it.
I have a copy for you.
Soon.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
All?
I am afraid.
Yes.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
Answer. 
Do I have money?
Roughly five thousand men.
Will we ever be in war?
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
In the Americas.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
Me?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
What do you think?
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
But, I have no experience.
Am I running away?
You have grown up very good.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
I do.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
How could I ever leave?
It is possible, Holiness.
It is a difficult situation.
Hmm.
No.  Do you?
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Go ahead.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
Mr. Cyr!
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
Cocktail?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
What the hell are you doing?!!
I'm laying a spring trap!
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
Raincheck.
Then do it!!
I don't know!
Get the gun.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
You do?
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
Just those two.
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
Are you sure?
Excuse me?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Oh, bullshit.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
I'd be able to see something.
You flew up here because your boss--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Good.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
I didn't say it like that.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Just forget it.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
It's okay.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Night.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Good idea.
Well...
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
You wanna ride in my truck?
No.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Good thinking.
I'll call the coroner.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
I thought I saw...
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
I'm sorry.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
He said he knew Karate!
What?
Me too.
The somebody else part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
It has nothing to do with--
<u>Kelly</u>--
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
You and Kevin.
Shitbutt?
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Lecter said a lot of things.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Well, except for the one girl.
He knew her...!
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Not yet.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
Are you finished?
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
Point taken.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Where?
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Dr. Lecter...
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
I think so.
Sometimes you do.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
I am, yes.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
No. You ate yours.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Then please - do this test for me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
I never thought about it.
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Was it a butterfly?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Killed outright?
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
No. Tell me why.
I - ran away...
No.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Then tell me how.
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice.
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Dr. Lecter -
Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
We leave in the morning?!
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Let us go, miss.
You knew them.
Why did they turn back?
I'm sorry.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Do not.  Promise me.
Maybe...
Alice?
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
You do not know what you are saying!
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Some say that's the way of it.
It can be dangerous...
I am sorry, Duncan...
We were headed...
No.
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
And if we're unlucky?
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Yes, sir.
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
Fire!!!
Atten-hut!
Yes sir!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Wampum?
Yes.
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Granted, Monsieur.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What has?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
What dead one on the ship?
Crunch...Implosion.
No.
That's an order!
I got hung up!  Try this!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Why can't we pick up his signal?
Good...It's going good.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Where's Jones?
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
...I'd really have to show it to you.
All right...
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Twenty minutes...
Roger.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
Hook's on 24...
...and a Russian grandmother...
What was it?
Itches like hell.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
What music?  There ain't no music.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
Who cares?
Two hundred meters.
The infirmary?...
What are you going to do to him?
Let's hope it holds.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
The air's stopped.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
Well, it's still a good idea.
It's hit us all hard!
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
It's a Samoan pub.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Can I help?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
No Harry, you can't.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
You had better be careful.
Just carrying a bag.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
What they like then?
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
Just hold on, I got the keys.
There is only three of us here.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Plank?
Invitations?
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
Tom?
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
For half a million?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I like your bar.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
At what, exactly?
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
How many wings have they got between them?
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Just shut up.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
That makes it okay?
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
He'll live.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm feeling okay--
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
I hear they're closing that post down.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Just wondering.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
That's not the point.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
That's in Maverick County.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
You look good--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
You were in a fight--
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
Best part of the job.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
If it's too late--
Uncle Al--
He never asked her.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Well--
He's still pissed off about it.
So I'm part-Indian?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
My father.
He does.
Cool.
You lived in the States for a while?
Something like that.
It's a lead mine.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Cliff--
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Mikey--
Mikey look at this--
They were using M-1's, yeah--
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
You could take it--
You know who it was they dug up?
Masons been around a long while.
Yeah. I bet he would.
Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Because I'm your father.
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
This girl has a child?
Tipico.
He was a unique individual.
And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
Seems like we have another one every week.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
I haven't been out here for a while.
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
We have a murder?
Open late.
Sam--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
The Sheriff.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
He was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I don't mean Fernando.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
That's me.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
I've seen 'em.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
He squeezed money out of you?
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
What was your deal with him?
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
I'll see what's going on.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
Yeah.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Like your story is over.
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
Just doing my job.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
Sure.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
No--
Uh-huh.
I know that.
Been away. Up to Houston.
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
Yeah.  It's French.
How much?
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
Why?
I love weird.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
D'Amour.
Right.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
It's an illusion.
I could scoop them out.
Don't.
He's with us... He's with us...
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
You don't?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
I'm no bodyguard.
They won't tell you anything.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
It's okay.
You can't.
I just saw him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
What makes you so sure?
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
I heard he was the best.
I'd like to hear them.
What are you, my mother?
I'm here to offer you a job.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Mine.
I saw him in Vegas once.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Are you a believer, then?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Yes.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Shit...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
What's her problem?
Yeah.  You could say that.
The Puritan?
What?
Harry D'Amour.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
For an introduction.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
I don't know what else to do.
Will that do?  No?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Looks that way.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Can you do it?
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
A couple of weeks.
Who is she?
No!
No!
Liar!
Yeah, they told me.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You'll do it?
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
What do you do?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Ok.
See you later.
No.
I know. I don't either.
It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Oh.
No, yes, it does...
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Fuck off.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
No, we'll find something around here.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
I'm going to miss you.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Can I enter?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Good-night.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Like Japanese food.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Ok.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Sure.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
It's amazing  there!
Sushi.
Hmmm.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I found them in your file box.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
Peter, are you okay?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
No, I wasn't, actually.
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
You just call?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Peter Kelson?
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You should think about getting professional help.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
What do you mean?
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
What did he say to you in French?
Sure of what?  Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle?  Results are what Lareaux would want.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
She told me she killed them.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
Oh, all that work.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
To that stewardess?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Maybe she is.
Whatever.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
You sure?
Thanks, sweetheart.
What'd you do?
Okay?
You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
It's okay.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Yes, we appreciate that.
Four days.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
No one's forcing her.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
I found you someone.
He's in college?
You do.
They ever love you back?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Chances are there's still a chance.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
She hates all freshmen.
Thanks.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Lucky.
For real?
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Big-ass titties?
Didn't know you cared so much.
Who's Spalding?
God, here we go.
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Hey.
Yeah.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
That what you think?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
I can't be nice to a fan?
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
She understands.
I...can't.
Quincy...
What's up?
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
You weren't at my game.
The "man" again.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
You forgot to be there.
Uh huh.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
I forgot, "Q-man."
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Figured it was something like that.
That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Like what?
Find.
Better late than never, right?
What?
Your heart.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Keep your voice down.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
He tore his ACL.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We were just studying.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Still the man.
Said he'd be home later.
Sorry.  You okay?
Whose truth are you talking about?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
Still is, so let yourself out.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Came by to check on you.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Hello, Phil.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well what's the situation?
OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
Does this sound weird?
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Brain and Lung.
Oh that's good.
I don't wanna talk to you.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
I'm sorry.
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Bit messy.
Yeah.
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
No.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Great, bye.
Well I don't go out very much.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
ok.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Let's make a deal.
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
Yeah.
I lost my gun.
What?
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
Just say no.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
please, what is it, please --
just let me walk out, ok?
Yes.
Claudia.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- can I get you?
I want a shot of tequila too.
Ready to go,go,go?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
It's upstairs.
Cynthia?
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT, DAD WE NEED TO GET HIS MONEY AND GO.
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
DAD.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Leave this one to the detectives, they ain't gonna solve shit, I can help you, make you the man with a plan, give you the gift that I flow -- think fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy?
No.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
Finish it up without the lip.
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
What happend?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
This sounds threatening.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
-- Samuel Johnson.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Braces?
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
Your teeth are fine.
It's...doesn't matter....
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Do you wanna sit down?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
I've seen it before.
There's no asshole like you.
...cocksucker....
You got it.
Who?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
You got us a room so quick?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Like I said, yeah --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
-- just to clarify --
This isn't meant --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Go ahead and waste your time.
Why does that sound silly?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
When did he go off chemo?
Uh. huh.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
Calm down.
There's no disturbance.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I AM CALM.
No.  I said that.
Marcie.
And what about screaming?
What's this, how did this happen?
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Yeah. Yes.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I need you to get me Paula --
You want her right now?
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
Slowly or quickly?
Come home soon after the show.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
I love you.
Love you too..
It'll take the pain away.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
I'm a bad person.
No.  No.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
I'll answer anything.
Paula.  Ellen.
How long with Paula?
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
Do you have any children with anyone?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
I don't know what I've done.
No.
You should know better.
Are you her boyfriend?
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
I can't.
Where will the money go?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Hang up the phone.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
Partridge?
What would you like?
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Water.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
That's it.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Thank you.
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
I need this one.
Sure.
I said I'm fine.
Yes.
Yes.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
...what...?
I have money to give you.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
This happens....this is something that happens.
No, stay back!  Stay back!
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
I am preparing for a ball!
I wish to discuss your brother.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
I am with you!
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Tomorrow.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Three days.
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
We must stop him!
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Pull them back!
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
No, not Louis!
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Well... Well... Okay.
We go someplace dangerous.
Come on...
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
Who?
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Raoul --
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Raoul is everything to me.
Oh my friend.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
Athos, I beg you --
The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
Your mother's.
She will be at the ball.
How did you --
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
A personal nature?
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
Forgive?!
I am unhurt --
What number, on the first page?
Yes, yes, go on.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
My dear, I've already done it.
No, you may wait behind the screen.
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
Yeah?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Cooperate?
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you need?
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Don't worry -
I didn't hit shit!
Right behind you.
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
She stole my car!!
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Yeah?
Seattle.
You'll find out - soon enough.
No.  A witness.
What exactly did you see?
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Jesus, man...
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
1490...Breckinridge...
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
You must be going somewhere.
Ditched you?
Screw him!
Not with this...
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
That's when it happened?
How are Molly and the boy?
Twenty minutes max.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Somebody hurt him?
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
I am all right.
These are all dead, Will.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
I know...
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
What's one way?
No other possibilities?
To recover the mind set.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
Tell me now.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There's no connection between the families.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
Have him peel the top label back.
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
What's being photographed?
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
In the kitchen.
It's a surprise.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Are you okay...?
Who?
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Was I in an accident?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
I don't want to know.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Not me.
Yes.
You will tell the truth?
Dr. Chilton.
Where did you get it?!
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
He's misunderstood.
'Intimate? !"
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
What happened to them?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
No.
What did he want?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
We have it good, don't we?
If I were?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
You haven't smoked in two years.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Will...
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
I want to see you, too.
What's this Mama shit?
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
You got a deal...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
I can't thank you enough, I...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I figured I'd ask you...
We don't know that.
Are you gonna kill him?
No.
And Hobbs died?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Pray tell.
Do you have the file with you
Yes.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Yes. I'd considered it.
I haven't decided yet.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Let's walk the route.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Those are my terms.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
But wasn't it funny?
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Tony Clifton.
Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Oh!
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
If you want...
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
You're a wimp.
What?!?
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
He said he's coming back!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
Know what?
Oh shit.
Should Tank I.D. it?
Right...
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
An accident?!
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
How many were there?
Dead.  All dead.
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
I got you.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
We have no choice.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
How?!
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
... Yes.
No.
I know exactly what you mean.
What does that mean?
Be what?  Be real?
You've never used them before.
When?
Wild, isn't it?
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
Yeah.
How?
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
The beginning?
She helped you?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
That's why we're here.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Good.
We're on our way --
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Shit, I'm sorry.
Not too bright though.
But what?
Who are you?
What is the Matrix?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
What?
She told me...
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
We can't leave him!
Not yet.
No.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
It's a city?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
What are you talking about?
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Cypher, I thought --
What the hell just happened?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Follow me.
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Let go of her.
Well the guy over there said...
Be careful.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
'And with your spirit.'
'Thou art then a king?'
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
Kennedy.
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Thanks for the ride.
Panther!  Same thing...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Should I slap him?
Don't promise...just deliver.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
How?
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
No you're not...
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Mind your own business.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
Good idea.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
We'll settle it tonight.
Let's go to the movies...on you.
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
How much was the original loan again?
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Whatever.
Fine.
I know.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Wha?
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Do you have enough?
Well...
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
I know...I know.
Sure.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
You think so?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
His wife?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
But it's your birthday.
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
We've got some things to discuss.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
That you've been to Susan?
He said he would be there with bells on.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
And that?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
I thought you were buying my company.
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Am I not obligated to?
Hello, Quince.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Why yes, thank you.
"Death and Taxes"?
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
No no, not you.
It's going to be great --
As close as a deal could be.
Yes.
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Uh -- he's from out of town --
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
'Just kidding'?
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
How nice for you both.
Please, Drew.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
I know.  Gum up the works.
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Are you?
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah.  Neat.
He was interested.
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
What you then?
No, no.  I on holiday.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Yes.
I am.
Rass!
Jennifer.
Love.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Come again?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I can see why.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Excuse me?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
No.
'To bed'?
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
More than you love peanut butter?
Yes!
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
'Love will find out the way'.
Hold me --
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
No.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
Yes?
I guess so.
Of course.
Make an exception?
I understand.
Are you sad, Bill?
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
This part I'm interested in.
Absolutely.
I don't know.
About Susan?
You tell me, Bill.
Just a manner of speaking.
I'm her father!
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
This universe?
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
No.
Are you threatening me?
That's life.  What can I tell you?
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
I do?  How long will you be staying?
Of course.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
Get what?
What the hell are you talking about?
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Good morning, Quince.
I am, this is it.  B Day.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Sure.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
We're all ears.
I am.  With you.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Aw, you're tough.
You're terrible.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Will it?...
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Nothing.
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
Yes, but --
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
You and 'Honey'?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
I'm sorry --
I agree --
Why?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
So you're a one-girl guy?
I could be her.
I've got patients coming in --
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Condition?
Amnesia?
So you're holding my calls?
As requested.
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
When was I in here?
Hi, Leonard.
That's right I did, didn't I?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Thanks.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't say anything else.
Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
Take the money and walk away!
I wasn't helping you for money.
Sorry.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
So I just take your word?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Who did he go to meet?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
And what did he say?
What are you gonna do?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Did you?
Help me.
How?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
That's different.
Shut the fuck up!
Can I ask you something?
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Thank you.
My boyfriend told me about you.
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Are you Teddy?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Shut your mouth!
You know it?
I don't remember.
You said you were leaving town.
Things change.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Why?
Give me your keys.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
I have money.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Somehow, I'll know!
Your name's Teddy.
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
You can't just take it!
Why would I have a gun?

And...?
He any good?
Recruit us to do what?
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
I got to talk to my ADO...
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
And what is that?
It goes very fast.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
That's right.
Exactly.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
What do you mean?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Where would I go?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
And what do I do with him?
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
'Cause she will tell you.
Stevens?
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Five minutes...
Like...?
No.
Verdado where?
No.
As in...?
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Switek?
If you're down, we're down for the play.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Sonny...?
On the phone.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
What's it say?
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
Define small.
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
You set this up!
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Lotta rich women back there...
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
I ain't sleepy.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Oh hell, forget it.
What's that supposed to mean?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
Yeah.
I'm scared.
What of?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
Yeah.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
You're what?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Get down -- where?
Instant V-goddam-D.
You got it.
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
Listen!
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
Don't make me laugh.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Stop shitting me, man!
Yeah. How's Mom?
The Hilton.
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Not far. Just a little way.
I'll pay extra
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
Would you recognize him again?
Yes.  I think so.
But didn't have heroin.
What's your father do?
Be tough on 'em.
...She was on the plane.
Twelve years.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
How long?
Hello.
And?
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Billy!  Please!
Where is it?
Yeah.
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
Max - where?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
You can't take anything seriously.
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
The lawyer?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
Weird shit...?
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
I think so. One right, two lefts...
And a right.
Right.
20 minutes.  Susan?
Oh, man, there you go again.
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Just do it!
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
What do you-?
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
You know what I mean...
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
We?
I heard how you talked to him.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
I was just late.
Susan, we're not b-
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Peter-
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Ah...
Talk to me.
That's it?
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
What is it?
Fuck! It broke the skin...
And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Anything you can tell me might help.
It's right this way.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
Sure.
Sounds good.
You got a point there...
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
What's it about?
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
Great.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
...have to wait.
I'm going to play my records all day
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
To Misery.
It is.
No, I haven't.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
I'm glad you like it.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
I'm almost done.
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Yes, he is.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
I'm sure you're right.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Not possible..
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
How grateful?
On what.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
What else?
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
It's that time.  Go.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
What are you talking about?
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
And the check's in the mall.
I am. She is.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
What can we do' mate?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Uh-huh.
- right..
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Ethan Hunt.
They've got a book for this?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Of what?
And six billion in the world.
I'd like a little more conviction..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Something like that.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Just about..
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
How do you suggest I go about it?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
It's going to be okay.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
You were there.
Not necessarily.
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
Yep.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
By asking me.
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Yes.
Always.
Sleeping's better.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
Okay...
Whos dead?
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
One hour.
Yeah.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
Certainly Ethan.
Profitable.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Like Job?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Where exactly is it?
Time up.
Jim we cant.
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
Then what am I doing here?
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Sure.  If the main character does.
No.  Abort.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
How did Kittridge do it?..
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Of course I can hear you.
Loud and clear.
Jack...that's spying.
Twenty minutes.
Run it through from the top.
The Shawfish?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
His brother.
I want you to stop seeing her.
I don't know what you mean.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What killed him?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I don't know. I got a feeling.
You have too many dogs.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
You are going to marry my brother?
Yes. Do you want...
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
How'd he die?
When you get engaged?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Seven years ago.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Why you talking to me?
A wolf without a foot!
Where are you taking me?
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
Loretta.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
That light.
It makes you look like an angel.
Don't just become excited.
I'm marrying your brother!
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
What did you do?
Oh no I didn't!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Alright. Where's the Met?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Kinda gaudy.
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
Awful?
I'm here!
Yeah.
No.
No.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Ronny, please...
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
What do you mean?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
Yes, on the floor.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
How was your plane ride?
We should talk alone.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
If I marry you my mother will die.
Pop.
No.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
No. He don't.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
A wife knows.
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
No. Are you drunk?
Where's pop?
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
WHAT!! She was dying!
It was a miracle.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
No.
You gotta date?
What sins have you to confess?
I know.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
He should pay.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
I don't know.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Have you come to make peace with me?
It was a miracle!
But absolutely!
Do you have a girlfriend?
Absolutely!
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Will you join me for dinner?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Don't shit where you eat.
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
I guess you can't invite me in?
No.
I'm a little cold.
Yes.
He's a plumber.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Is who down there?
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
I knew she had it.
Burn them.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
I'm not interested.
No one live there.
Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.
You don't vote for kings.
NI!   NI!
A what?
Of course.
What is that?
Oh, please!
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
What, "is"?
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Stop that.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Ni!
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.

I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Quite.
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
There he is!
Behind the rabbit?
I warned you!
Man!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
... but a two-thirds majority ...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Come on, patsy.
Course it's a good idea.
Do me a favour.
What is your name?
Yes he is.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
When's your next round?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
I think I could pull through, sir.
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
Gosh - Is he all right?
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
What - the curtains?
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Rather what?
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
Not you.
How?
Yes?
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Oh, I see,  Right.
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Why?
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Well ... yes ...
Don't say that word.
Bravely ran away, away.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I can't let her down now, Archie.
You watch your tongue.
You know nothing about her!
When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
Get out.  Out!
It's a diary.
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Louder, girl!
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Good man.  And is she all right?
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
The future King!
Out of my way!
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Back and upper corridors.
How will I know what she requires?
I need a man who knows where I am.
Yes.  I do.
Nobody has any rights over me.
Dare say you can be taught.
I'm fine.
I'm not married.
Why?
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
She trusts you, John.
They aren't as watchful as you.
She'll never understand it.
She'll think I betrayed her.
I am.
Archie.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
What does he know about the Highlands?
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
Aye.
I heard something.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
I came as quickly as I could.
I beg your pardon?
Is that not enough?
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
We'll see which way the wind blows.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
What's her excuse this time?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Not too protracted, I hope.
A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
Yes.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Of course.
Whom?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
Just them?
What is he doing there?
Why not?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Ma'am.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Yeah, who isn't.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
It's the game, ARCADE.
You don't like it?
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
What's her problem?
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
It is.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
All of them?
Let's go around back.
We can't...
Like the fractals?
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
I don't know.
And beat it at it's own game.
What are you going to do?
Dante's Inferno.
Put in a quarter.
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
What?
Don't even say it.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
You've got the schematics, check.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
There...
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
And then keep on driving?
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Yes...
Then we'll go home.
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
The game will guide you.
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
What do you mean "you know"?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
You gotta be kidding?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
How's that?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
Okay.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
You got it! See you later honey.
I was afraid of that.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Very pleased to meet you.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
No. I can't.
Number 17.
But it said #12.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Call the number.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"But you won't..."
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
Good luck!
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
This Denny's.
Oh boy.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah.
Could be unrelated.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Where at?
Damn, that's a long drive.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No...
Sure.
What's going on ?
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
I'm not fucking him..
I don't know.
We have to climb up that.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
What ?
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
I'm not listening.
I'm listening.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
I wanted to let his family know....
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Okay.
Fine...
Just shut the fuck up.
And that's different than this because...... ?
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Ow...
Knock yourself out.
Don't have to tell me twice.
I said NO.
Got it.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
Trust is earned not given away.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Good, sir.
Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
Bruce has just awaken.
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
I'll see that bet.
I can see that but where ?
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
What happened ?
The power went out in half the park.
How can this happen ?
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Thank you.
I meant him.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Yes.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Yahoo !!!!!
Wake up, we're in trouble.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
Zach from work ?
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  "Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?" or "You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought".
Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
I figured you did.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Great.
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
I already bought a ticket.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
Special effects?
I'd say you turned out just fine.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Then I have come to the right place.
Rose.
O.K. Thank you very much.
I never met my mother.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
You're so clever.
You're over reacting!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
TAXI!!!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
I'd never do that.
Change my name.
What, you think the guy should change his name?
What if you don't wanna be found?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
I think it's cool.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Does it work?
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
DON'T, come on!!!
In the tar??
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Here's Judy Garland!
What do you think?
This has been a real confusing day.
No?
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
She'll be all right baby.
Excuse me?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Oh no.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
You have no idea.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
WHAT?
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Pardon?
I need the job.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I wrote that.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
What happened to her?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Want to what?
Good.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Really?
I'll second that.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Dad?
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
Dad??
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Can I go too?
Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
What was my mama like?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Thank you. Bye.
Thirty five dollars.
What do you get for that?
I wrote a poem too.
Please.
Do you think she is?
Probably.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
Chocolate?
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
He won't give it to me.
Thomas?
No, I'm divorced.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Sure.
Come here, sit down.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
See food!
Yes!!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
To chocolate?
Uh huh.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
I can't, I have to go home.
Naah, I don't wanna.
Okay, OW!
Where's your bike?
What?
Heaven.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
I stopped that!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Duck!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
So?
What do you want it for anyway?
I am running faster!!
But I have my clothes on!
Bye Ma.
I wanna live with them too.
I dunno..
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
No.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
For what?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Kindred spirits.
We're about to find out.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
You're butting in.
Go figure you.
You've been working on this, huh?
Sure.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
I wish.
That was Thursday.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
Manicure...
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Good girl.
You need a few dollars.
Can you watch the road?
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
He said that, too.
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
... except one.
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
And the answer was so simple.
I've missed a step.
Ju...
... whatever is manly and independent.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
Well, somet...
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
She's too genuine.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Never can tell.
Michael!!
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
You keep saying that.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
Except for that.
Me either.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
The night we met.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
... maybe it's congratulations.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
It's over.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Get married, apparently.
And your point?
... yeah, that.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Lower.
I came here, looking for her.
This is where I proposed.
Almost three.
The most important thing. Is being together.
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
... I'm partial to the tight end.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
What?
Grand Old Opera --
No.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
Then why are you listening to her -
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
All those people...
How did you come in here?
What's wrong with her.
He knows better.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
I said 'no!'
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Your job, huh.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
What!
That's what he wants.
It's on National television, Barnett.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
When is it?
Bill, he's a crazy man.
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
Where the hell have you been?
National?
What crook?
Not yet.
I'll just be in here.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
How in the world did he get shot?
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
Hi, Sherry.
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
He is just wonderful.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Replacement party.
You must really like him.
No.
Need a ride?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
What year?
Oh... Well.
The car broke down.
I feel really good.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
When did you start singing?
How long have you been with them?
About three years.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
He's a member of our congregation.
I'm here.
Yes.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
I know.
Car pool?
Oh.
What?
It's me. What is it?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
An album.
Sleeping.
Out.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Come on.
Why?
What? Oh. A film.
You go to school together?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Ryan O'Neal.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
More or less...
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
That's what Tim said.
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Are we in a big hurry?
You got something you want to do?
Yeah.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Don't stop!
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
Oh my God!  Sorry.
What?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Look, I'll trade you.
It's video.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.
How 'bout Manson?
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
All right, Mickey.
Don't worry about it.
Aside from the obvious?
Then was it worth it?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
That's indescribable.
Out front.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
You made every day like kindergarten.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Here.
That's my opinion.
Jesus...
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
And where do you keep Mickey?
Who?
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
What are we talking about?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
No thanks.
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
All right, you get out of here, man!
Want to talk to you.
What d'you think?
What did you say your name is?
Name's Duff.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Thanks.
Just so you do your work.
Well, he worked around.
Yeah, I been there.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
No. I'm new in town.
Yeah. On the section gang.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Yes, aren't you?
That's right.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
How d'you mean?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Why did you?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Yeah. Well, I do.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
Four.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Yeah?
He could live with us.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Am I as good as they?
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
I don't want to hurt you.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Watch out!
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Well, that'll be the first time.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
What's on your mind?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Beat it!
What did you say, boy?!
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
No thanks, Lee.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Thank you.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
It ain't in me.
It's for your own good.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
That'll make the folks very happy.
No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
No. I only needed the code from you.
Don't play with me.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
It hasn't yet.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
What are you talking about?
I find out now.
Can you read my mind?
The words?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
I don't have a girl.
You're pleasant tonight.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Yeah.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Nobody has.
What?
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
No!... No...
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Maybe something's onto him.
What?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Case...
I'll be okay.
I know you have. C'mere.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Why do they listen to Guy?
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Petty good.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Who told!
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Okay. That's bad.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
Very romantic.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Sometimes opposites attract.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Oh. Right.
Kristen got a quote?
Uhh, no.
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
OUT!
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
You said that already.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
See!
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Don't you remember what they called you?
I can't do this.
Is that true?
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Rufus?
I know.
You like her?
Oh I don't think so.
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
Thank you.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You have to say that. You're my student.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
When are you going to open your eyes?
Do you think you'll find her?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
We're very evolved.
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Well, a ball player.
And heavy...
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I can't help it.
Good.  I'm hungry.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Who's Lisa?
I told you I want that room unpacked.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
You two got a thing going, or what?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
Yeah?
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Wow...
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
Uh-uh.  Wait...
About what?
What is it?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
There's nothing to figure out.
Hi, Kerry.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
I'll need to take her things.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Deal.  Thanks.
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
Sure.
How do we find him, Kristen?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Oh God.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Sorry.
Sounds like a rough time.
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
With Hypnocyl?
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Just until we get things under control.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
For what?
The truth.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
No...
Your dreams?
We can't get to her.  I've tried.
Neil, please --
How do we get in?
No.  We're alone.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Oh God.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Fifteen million dollars.
Really?
Coffee?
Bye.
Hello.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
That's fine.
What did you say?
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
My son's name is Johnny?
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
No.  What's that?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Okay.
What?
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Stay forever.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
That's spectacularly unfair.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Okay.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
The truth is...
The movie star?
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Right. 
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
And we intend to use them!
Working with Leonardo.
Blimey.  What's that?
Well, thanks, that's great.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Yes?
This is Henry James film?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
No, it doesn't.
Buggered?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Is it someone we know?
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
How about Miss Flintstone?
Does she know you're coming?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
So -- any messages?
Two?  That's it?
You want me to write down all your messages?
Right.  No one else?
What?
Sort of.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Oh.  Right.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Bad news.
What?
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Yes, that is correct.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Mister Sefelt?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
No! No! No!
Mister Washington.
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Right!
Go on...
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
No, it was irresponsible!
Thank you, ma'am.
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
B-B-Billy.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
O-o-o-oh...
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Fuck Miss Ratched!
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
H-Hey, M-Mack.
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Marry who?
Are they all crazies?
Wow! They're so quiet.
What for?
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Shhh...
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
What?
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
A pecking party?
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
What for?
Lobotomy?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
So why are you talking to him?
It doesn't help him.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
When?
Yesterday...
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Hold it a minute.
Bye-bye.
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
What is it?
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Oh, do you do much fishing?
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Oh, what was that?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
Good. Good.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm the next one.
You're breathin' right now.
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
What's going on?
How much ya wanna bet?
Sure...
Martini out!
Oh, yeah...
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Are you a doctor?
What?
Hi.
That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
Thank you, ma'am,
Huh?
You're a witness, Doc!
Evenin', ma'am.
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
Your mother.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
No.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Oh no.  Do you?
No...
Dwayne?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
Thanks.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
So?
So it wasn't real.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Yeah.
What?
So were you.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
You aren't?
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
There's no such thing.
What?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Really?
Really...
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Let's face it.  You want me.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Oh.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he married?
So?...
Yes you did.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I know.  You're right.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
No...  I can just tell.
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
It's still the new year...
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
My God, you have...
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
We lost him?...
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
He fell out.
What is it?
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
Who said I was going?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
What if he doesn't like me?
My God... you're right.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
Kate.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
I thank you.
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
She's not here.
That's really romantic.
Ten billion to one.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Thicker than water.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Maybe.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
They play pretty rough.
I'm with Terry.
I'll get home all right now.
You training to be a nun or something?
In braids? That's right.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
What for?
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
How do you like that one?
I don't know.
It's quite  nice.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
That goes double for me.
I don't rate it.
I know... I know... .
Terry, what's wrong?
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Get out of my way.
Well, it's over.
My pigeons... .
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Farm...
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
Your gun.
Mind your own business, Father.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
D 'n D?
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
I'm just resting my feet.
Yeah, really!
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
You'll work.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Be sure they got enough water.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You was a Golden Warrior.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
I'll see you on the roof.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
Go on, beat it!
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
One little dime you don't need.  I know you you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint  only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
Look who says bum!
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
I do not joke in my proposal.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Okay.
It frightens me.
Then..then what's that music?
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Nothing is worth your life.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
You do?
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
A situation easily remedied.
Tie them that they may watch.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
Ahh, she will be yours.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Aaaahhhh.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
What do you suppose for?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
I said not as a rule.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
And the one driving the other car?
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
Who is it?
Tell me, how do you do that?
No, thanks.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
Yes.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
She's coming with us.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Just that she got away.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Shit.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
You might not have a choice.
Yes, she did.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
Yeah, I did.
Whatta you wanna do?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Shit.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
Jack --
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
You talked to him?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
And what happened to Carl?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You're gonna use a ram?
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Call and tell you.
What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.
You don't, huh?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
No, I didn't know that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
I'll need a last known address.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Glenn didn't tell you?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
I thought everything.
I wasn't asking permission.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
A little.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
In my bag, in the car.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Why, are you famous?
I thought so, too.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
Nothing.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You have to be kidding.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Who was it answered the phone?
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Love it.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
That's not what you were about to say.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
The backseat.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
How many?
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
It's a big house.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
The fish?
The next time I walk into a bank.
What's to think about?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
There were others.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
You're not?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
No.
Here?  In this house?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
What did you call it?
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
What'd I say?
No?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
You wave back?
So?
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
It's possible.  Why?
Likewise.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Ten gees.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Yes Sir.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
What lizard?
Good shooting, Rafe!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
What facts are those?
So what are you saying?
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Fuck you.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Home of the brave.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
Yes you can.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
...He said that?
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
Then wh-where do we land?
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Thank you, Sir.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Our doctor's gone too.
Sorry to trouble you.
Yes'm.
I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
You waited til tonight to tell me?
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
How do you like my hair?
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Just what you underlined.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Charlie...
And nothing will ever change that.
I call this the staccato. 
Oh yeah?
Refresh my memory.
Why wait?
Would you?
Great, isn't it?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
You really love me, don't you?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
What am I going to do with you?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
But what has to be different?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
You're going to listen to me.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
I know.
I've got to go now.
Come back to me.
I'm trying.
Charlie? Was I dead?
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
What would that be, sir?
Okay.
What, why?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
I wish she hadn't.
But I'm remembering the future.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
It must run in the family.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
What're you doing here anyway?
What are you shooting for?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
I'd love to.
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
What a treat.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
Yes.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
I'm excused.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Sort of.
The house payments.
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
I don't feel very festive.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Sort of.
I	know what a burrito is.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
What if you're not here tomorrow?
Richard, take it easy.
When do we start?
Come on. You can't be serious.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
High tech. I like the sound of that.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
What will they be made of?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
You alright?
I still can't believe she's dead...
I'm going out, Dad!
I'm not hungry.
All set.
The old Indian burial ground.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
What do you mean?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
All the time.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
I miss him too...
You know everything, don't you?
In a word, Bob...
Bob...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
Drew!
I'm not ready to die.
Whatever.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
About my blood work?
Sounds delightful.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
As in, the vegetable?
Correct. I don't.
Fine.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
What's her name?
They didn't fire her?
No. They didn't fire her.
We're friends of Beckett's.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Let's find you a drink.
Sure. It's fine.
You're right.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Beckett?
Do you... pray?
I've considered that.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Opera?
What impressed you about him?
I still am.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Yes.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
That's correct.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
In a word, yes.
People who want to bend the rules...
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
How many do you know?
Who?
Okay, Joe...
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Why should I?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Had it with deals.
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
One or two.
You sure you can keep --
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Don't do this to me....
It's starting....
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
We just keep him locked up forever?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
I assume he licked it clean.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
Let's wait on the power cells.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
I never said I was.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
What the hell's it matter?
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
What, you're goin' off, too?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Riddick?
I would rather we all stay--
Has anyone checked the coring room?
SULEIMAN!
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Not staying in here another....
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
About the girl.
No. She's not.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Do you have any weapons?
Just the same, I want one.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Right now, if you like.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
What are you doing there?
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Neither do I.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
The blood transfusion.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
The evidence was very meager --
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
None at all.
Him.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Sustained.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Show this to the President.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Do as I say.
What signal?
To Earth! That we've landed!
We're here to stay.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
I want her.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
The Hunt Club.
My name is Taylor.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Okay.Up to the cave.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
What is this?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Maybe not.
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
Taylor, you can't.
It's humiliating.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
This is his assertion.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah?
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
I got one...
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
No!
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
I volunteered.
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Who gives a shit!
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin' down by the river. What you got Taylor?  Let's see three hundred and WHAT?
You know what I'm talking about!
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
How far does this train go?
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
I'm supposing.
Not tonight.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
I haven't been invited.
Okay. You win.
Why certainly, baby.
How careful should I be?
I see.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
And do you amuse the guests?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Why not?
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
You don't know who he is?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Try not talking.
No use waiting, then.
So have I.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
Do you have to leave the note?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Frozen.
If you're doing all this just for me.
That, and the fun of it.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
No.  I paid him off.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
You must come from pretty far South.
You've had dealings with the police before?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
You understand perfectly.
There isn't anything you can do.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
I can't answer that.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I know that.
Goodbye, Betty.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
Morning. Any calls?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
You mentioned information.
Get it in half an hour.
Why not here?
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
If I can get off.
No.
We do, when we get the chance.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I never notice the view after the first week.
I wouldn't know.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
What?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Thank you.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Men like you don't need orders.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
Should be over there.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Not quiet yet.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
I'm interested in who handled it.
The card says so, doesn't it?
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
It's fine, thank you.
I think you'll do very well.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
Hello.
Freshman and sophomores...
I thought it was tremendous.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
Who?
Very thoughtful.
Well, you know...
You just might.
I haven't really thought about it.
Well, you should.
What did he want?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
That'll be fun
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Nonsense.
It's shit.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
You're a piece of shit
Take a look at these.
Terrific.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
That's good.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
Well, it's worth seeing.
Now listen...
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
Darling Susan.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
They won't let you in without one.
You'd look naked without one.
Promise.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
I say when it's over!
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
SHIT!!
A little mushy.
Babes.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Nothing.
Figured you did.
NOOO!!
Shrimp and fries.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Tyler, put the gun down.
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
Who cares!
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
No more games.
Right behind you.
What, Sergeant?
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
There's something else, Major...
Where the hell is his body?
He knows our defenses.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Please, we hardly know each other.
I talked to some developers about the land.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
You looking' for some company?
Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
So do day jobs.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
For an hour.
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Do you plan everything?
Always.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Yes...
"Occupational hazard".
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Don't drown.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
I got a dress, yeah.
Any good?
I have work to do.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Come with me?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
I really am sorry.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Shush.  Of course you can.
But don't they have it in English?
I more than liked it.
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
You just did.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
The young lady staying in your room?
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
But, Edward...
And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
I'm up.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Give me twenty minutes.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Yeah.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
It was great.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Rent.  You're late.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Kit give me nothin'.
You're a guest here?
Vivian.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
But I always eat like this.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
I don't think it would fit you.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Then I'm here till I die?
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
But what if something happens to you?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Gently.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Gently!!
It never happened.
What?
Did you say, "I do"?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
What do I do?
He's really very short on charm.
Yes, some of the time. 
How many could you handle?
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
But you don't know where he is.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
The body?
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Where did you get that?
What is it?
Has it got any sports in it?
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
I don't mind so much.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Shall we track them both?
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
Not yet.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Thank you.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
You are ready, then?
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
You know what a hurry we're in.
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"I want to croon,
Oooooooops!
Ooooooops.
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Mr. Bialystock ...
Where?  What?
But that's cheating!
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
But what if the play was a hit?
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Two pistachios, my good man.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
What???
Shut up.
Liebkind, no!
What is it?
Yes.
Vat about it?
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Get car.  Get car.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
I shall count the minutes.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Bismark...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Where are you going vit the light?
What have you done, LSD?
What do you do best?
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No! Of all...
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I live there. Alone.
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Who are you, friend?
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
What difference does that...
Is Mary here?
Where?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Where... can I stay?
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Contemplate your... panic button.
Yes. I think he would have.
Who's he?
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Neither will I.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Huh?
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
I believe it.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
What makes you sound so certain?
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Why not?
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
Can you?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I haven't even been married once yet!
How can you even think a thing like that!
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
No.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
I imagine so.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Why don't you go away?
Thank you, Norman.
Norman.
You're not going to... to your room already?
I'd like to, but...
Crane.
That's it. 
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Is there?
No need to apologize...
Why?
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
I suppose you want a cabin.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Shut up!
Leave me alone!
...Forty thousand dollars!
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
Did I?
Did she talk?
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Who are you? What is your name?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Maybe you want my money, too.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
But where do the rats come in?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
Yes!
There's no child here.
No?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don't agree with you.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
Well, I do say it.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Meaning what?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
What does that prove?
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
You're insane.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
You taking any medication?
You did miss --
That's the physicist's playground.
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
But who were they?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Well, all right.
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
But Rose...
I said I wouldn't.
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
But I don't know who they are.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
You won't die, Rose.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Okay.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Five hundred rabbits?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I do, too.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
She's getting herself up to go out.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I can't see, let me see...
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, that was my place.
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
No, son, she is dead.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
I'm not blubbering.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
What do you think of her, honey?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Yes, of course.
What time is it?
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
Honey, please...
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
I... I'll get the grits.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
There are more on the other side.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
You don't know where you're going?
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Oh, no, sir.
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Well, it was a silly question.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Well, no, I didn't actually.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
Illusions, Madam?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
You're so sweet.
Yes, Ma'am.
You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening.  I'll need the car keys.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
You're not gonna see him again.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
What and?  That's what I got.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
What... ?
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
No you can't.
Relax.
We should slow down.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Clench your teeth.
Dean Martin.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
They shot us all, kid.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
What was I supposed to do?
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
You're lying...
No.
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Maybe.
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Don't crowd him.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
That's not true.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Who is that... ?
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Know what I love about dynamite?
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
All right. Stand by.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
As you wish.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Yes, my Master.
His lightsaber.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
All set.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Yeah, sure.
That's all any of us can see.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Here's the terminal.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
You love him, don't you?
Lando!
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
We shall double our efforts.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Oh, no.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Your father?
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
I will not fight you.
Your father he is.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Disintegrated?
Certainly not!
Oh well.  How about you.  
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
He might be.  I don't know.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
I've got something to say.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
Yes.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
So come up to the Lab.
Dealing
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Oh.
The delivery boy.
...Fine.
Shell-shocked!
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...No thanks.
I sold them to you.
D'you really wanna call?
It's fine.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
No, I don't belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
'Bout seven.
I'll be waiting.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
-- The legs.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
What're we going to do?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
...Like you?
I can't go out.
You didn't!
That so.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Give my main man a raise!!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
...This man.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Does that bum have to say that?
Kiss my ass.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Why?
No dollar.
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Few minutes?
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Creed is down!!!
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Bob.
That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
You think I don't hear things?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
No -- Just me.
What?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
What'd you say?
Hey --
...Yeah.
Why?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What was I gonna say?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Yeah.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Facts is facts. I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house --
Come July, twenty-five.
More like thirty.
Did ya win?
Spider Rice.
Yeah, sure.
Here's the card?
What's happened is freak luck.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Great, kid, great.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
What kinda business?
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
It don't matter.
It don't bother me none.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Help what?
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
...Tight.
...No.
Gazzo's a good man.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Maybe --
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Well, I'll be...
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
A tweeting bird?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Is this paper even good?
R.K. Maroon.
Bastards put him on notice.
He's a Toon... who cares?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Maroon, right?
Oh, no...
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
That's right, me.
What am I, Earl?
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
I didn't know who I could trust.
A joker to the end.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
So's the job.
Aren't you the lucky one...
As soon as is humanly possible.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Maybe.  Why?
Stop what?
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
Take it easy.
There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Don't ever forget that.
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Forget it.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Only time will tell.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
In love?
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
But 'tis no wit to go.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Young Romeo is it?
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
By the hour of nine.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
That dreamers often lie.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
A most courteous exposition.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
You know it is.
Of course.
And I don't believe you...
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Not to me, you know that.
They're good!
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
I didn't say I was.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
He's company.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
You'll die if you leave here.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
Bullshit!
That's it.
There is one other thing...
What's that?
Don't cross me...
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Not exactly.
How did you know?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Soon.
But first you have something to take care of?
Created?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
Why don't you go do better, then...
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
Everybody.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
Things.  This is my country, you know.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Same thing, isn't it?
One's a lot more painful than the other.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Like Larry or Swede.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I wanted to see who you were.
I just wanted to see something.
See what?
You were smoking?
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
I'm going with you.
I know of him.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Thorough man.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
I never made that claim.
How could you have done that?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Business keeps you on the road?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Because I don't walk away.
No, I don't.
And now...
Finish it!
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
You sure?
It's the Irish tape we want.
Gonna be tough.
Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill him?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Don't lie to me!!!!
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Never heard of it.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
We don't know that.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Well someone's gonna find them.
Hell, it won't be us!
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
What makes you so sure?
Maybe.  Who cares?
All right we will.
What's that?
He saw everything!
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
He would have done it to us, right?
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
And how do you figure we do that?
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
Rock solid.
My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is...
I'm all ears.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You mean that guy was an agent?
Has he?
Hi.
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm in here.
You deserve it is the occasion.
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
I love you.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
You know I do.
Could it have been this?
You said that, I didn't.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
We appreciate that.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Why would someone do that?
Maybe I should come along.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Is this marked money, or what?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Well I just uh, you know...
Hmmm...
Shopping here?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Yeah...see you at three.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Forget it.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Then what the hell are you all about?
Well you can't have it.
I think I am.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Well, same ol' same ol'.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Are you hungry?
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
The band has been playing over an hour.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
So what's your story?
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I said get on your feet!
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
I don't think so...
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
You bring American money?
Oh yes, she's very nice.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Who died?
Not Yu.  You!
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Forget it.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
You said --
Why LA?
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Follow the Rich White Man?
How do you know he's our man?
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
It doesn't matter.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
We have to get to the Penthouse.
No problem.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
This money is evidence.
Amen to that, brother.
Fine with me.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
I need your help.
No.  But I'll help you.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Are you okay, Lee?
Thank you.
I'll take him.
You must come with me for questioning.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
Ricky Tan?
I know, Master, but...
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
He was just doing his job.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
We are both full of shit.
What?
Witnesses.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
No.
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Don't go there...
It happens.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
You know War?
Yes, I think so.
Yee-aww.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
I'm sorry.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Where'd you get it?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
I could get promoted right out of here.
What's wrong with that?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
Shut up!
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I want to speak with my daughter!
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I'm not running.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
Thank you.
Got any last minute advice?
Maintain eye contact.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
It happens to be how I feel.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
He's here!... He's here!
His hair... any color.
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
No.  No, you didn't.
You're coming here?
Then come for dinner.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Oh, please!
Are you a reporter?
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
-- The luau for Maggie.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Twice...
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
Really.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Highly suspect.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Can you fix it?
Excuse me?
Yes.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Me?
And the church.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
She's the boss.
Ya think?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Quick.  Very quick.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Nope.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
I love you.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year.
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
And then I'll see you in New York --
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
You couldn't.
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
What's with you?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Listen to this, I love this part --
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
M.F.E.O.?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I know. 
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Any time.
How did it happen?
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
You know.
Grace heard it.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Who is this?
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
Have you had any relationship since?
What's she talking about?
It's hard to imagine.
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
It's not that late in Seattle.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
It is not --
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
What's tira misu?
Do you want a fruit plate?
I don't think I have to now.
It's a spice rack.
Dad --
Sure.  Looking good.
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
English muffin.  How do you do it?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Will she scratch up your back?
How do you know?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Not now, Jonah --
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Jonah!
I just called for a second.
The one who wrote us.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
This is the one I like.
This conversation is finished.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Microwave.  Five minutes.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Hi.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
I read the same article...
Sure.  Sure.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
The woman question?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
So much the better.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
What's more important than sanitation?
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
No, no ...
He'll have it good. Some day.
They say I am no good to you.
What makes you so sure?
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
No.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Sure.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Be still ...
Alone?
Like what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
Are you Australian?
Yeah.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Did you see his hair color?
No, Why?
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
That bad, huh?
Nothing.
It's not that easy.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Then leave.
I can't.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
What do you want from me, Colette?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
He knows where I work.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How?
Midnight?
I know a guy.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
Don't get carried away.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
No  You think she's a tweaker?
Yes, Jimmy
Thanks for not laughing at me.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
You aren't coming with me.
It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Tell me what?
This chink have a name?
Bubba.
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Jesus.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
And what does this have to do with me?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
...alright, let me know when.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Spit it out, Captain.
No kidding.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
You must be a hell a shot.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
Like hell, you did.
What deal?
Who's Wade?
White-walls?
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
Senator's son?
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Pass.
You think the rest of us were?
Where are you from, Captain?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
The men said, nine.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Sure, you got one?
The Germans do.
I changed my mind.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Maybe.
Nope.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
You're kidding yourself.
You never know.
Yup, hell of a mission.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
How about I go right, sir?
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Let's just find someplace.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
Just what I want to do.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
You're welcome, John.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Yeah, how so?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Huh?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
We can't leave it here.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
No, sir.
That's a mystery to me.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Yeah?
And Sarge?
Get lost.
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
Good for her.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
I still am.
C'mon, just do it.
I already did.
Read it.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Wait a minute.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
I dream about it.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Crash paranoia.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Honey!
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hi.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Are you busy on Friday?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Goodbye.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Today is tomorrow.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Well... just meet her.
Oh.  I was putting the...
This is so noble.
You're shaking.
You're cold.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
We'll see.
We decided...
Yeah you do.
No.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Just my dad.
Then don't do it.
I'm sorry.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
One more time would be nice.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
No.
Hello Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
I called her up.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
I don't really know where we are.
Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
I was just going to kind of move around.
I love you too.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
Sir, the list is correct.
They're not gone, they're here.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
When?
Yeah, sure.
I just told you.
You asked for shoe polish.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
That's great, thanks.
There's nothing in the stores.
Things are great, things are great.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
It kind of looks that way.
Something they can hold in their hands.
They should be.
The war could end.
Ah, yes.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
Yes.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Take the neighborhood.
They've broken their pattern.
I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
That's too bad.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
I live here.
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Why don't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Thats quick.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
What guy?
I got it..
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Until now.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Yeah?
Can we turn the light on?
That's not the way it's done.
We'd break some furniture.
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
That's not the way we play the game.
You're pretty when you're angry.
You're getting obvious.
I dont know.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Is Sid in therapy?
What?
Hello?  Hello?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
But she's standing right next to you.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Closer than you think.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
We got free tickets.
Now.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
He's after me.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Hello.
Who is this?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
What?!
A note?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
And who would that be?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Hmm.
Oh yeah, how?
Yeah. A real tragedy.
The killer called her.
What?  When?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Show him.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
And who is that?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
No really?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Who's this.
GALE WATCHOUT!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
Hello.
But you know my favorite name?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Who the fuck is this?
Sorry.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
Where the fuck did she go?
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
Oh it did?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
No...
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
You lost your mom...
Oh Sidney...
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Stop it!
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
I think you have the wrong number.
Do I?
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
You're making popcorn?
Do you like scary movies?
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.
Don't hang up on me.
No-bored.
More of a game, really.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm getting scared.
So you better leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Can I bring Kenny?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I'll get my camera.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Yeah.
How is everything?
He's her boyfriend.
Drive by patrol.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Call the police.
You want to go live?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
Yes, that's right.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Many times.
Has his story changed?
Why would she lie about it?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Hello Sidney.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Like you had one.
I'll be right back.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
It's all part of the game.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Just like old times, ain't it?
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
How's that?
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
I'm in.
No, I haven't heard.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Hello.
David... please...
You know that's not true.
It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
And, why is that?
Shut up!
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
I... I don't follow.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
No one yet.
There's a bucket.  Under the table.
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
I read.  Remember reading?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
The fingerprints.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
Call an ambulance.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
I don't know... like fifty.
You got to be kidding.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
We're focusing.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
Think about how we got here!
Then, he must write about these murders.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
What are you talking about?  What happened?
I can't do this now... please.
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Did the wife confess?
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
It was, I tell you!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
You got one now!
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Told ya, didn't I?
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Keep talking.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Well, fust off...
If they're still alive...
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Forget it...
What?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Nine...  Ten!
We won't be here...Come on!
I've seen her...and she's alive.
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
Finish your breakfast...
It wasn't much of a letter...
I got to fetch her home...
Oh God, Tommi...
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
It still worked in town.
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
But what is the truth?
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
It's good.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Lady?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the money?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
Treachery!
No Juliet?!
What is the chief part?
How much?
You're a liar.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
That's me.
Put his feet in.
There's never any
So what do we do?
How?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
But nothing is happening.
Yes, but very well.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
What happened to Sam?
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
I did not.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
The show must  you know
How goes it, Will?
Do you think?
I thought your play was for Burbage.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
I have lost my gift.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
I like her.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
You admire it?
Who is there?
It is strange to me, too.
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
You lie.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Orsinogood name
Nor you for me.
You flatter, my lord.
I do not love you, my lord.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Where did you learn how to do that?
I . . .
Do you understand me?
Your aunt?
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
About what?
Why, thank you, David.
Think about it.
When are you going to let the police know?
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
But not quite.
Your friends.
Except the money.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
So I gathered.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
Yeah?
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Where do you think you'll go?
I don't know.
Don't know what?
What?
Yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
What I am.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
So?
Now?
Yes.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
What are you doing?
David?
Stop nagging.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Who?
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
You were magnificent.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
It's the only way.
I refuse.
Everything.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Oh, shut up, Alex.
No.
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
What about?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Did you ever kill a man?
Two hundred pounds?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Who have you talked to?
I should hope so.
And you need your sleep.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Sorry?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Eh --
Yes, sir.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
What guy?
Writing seems easy.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Did he sound upset?
For what?
You know about it?
I write about it?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Same as everyone else.
Yes.
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Or a fake?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
What're you talking about, George?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
That's okay too.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
It turned out to be cancer.
What?
-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Hello, George.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Well she...
... what?...
Uh-uh.
It isn't?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Okay.
Hello.
Yeah.
A little.
Did you hear me?
... yeah.
Gee, this is great.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
I never get my hair done.
You think that's funny, don't you?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Yeah.
How is she?
Great.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
I guess not...
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
Yeah.
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
You do it.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I don't know. Probably not.
Whew.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Well, did you or didn't you?
You did, didn't you?
You did, I know you did.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
Don't, don't, don't...
What are you talking about?
You don't do that anymore, do you?
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
He never stopped.
Me?
Not me, pal.
-- do you want ice?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
What?
Don't go, Jackie...
Don't leave me...
I don't know -- I've got to.
Wanda...
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
Otis is dead.
I have to see you.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
Keep moving --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
What about me?
I am?
-- Sure.
Okay...  Night, baby.
What!
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Could I?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Okay.
Whether or not I'm going.
Egypt.
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
... Okay...
Never mind. Where've you been?
Look at the way I live.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
Commercials.
What is.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
-- please, baby --
How?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
That's all you've got to say?
-- yes.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
I said you were a loser!
-- A wash and set.
No?
Thank you.
I see.
But what?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Sure.
Oh yeah?
-- yeah?
See she doesn't drink too much.
What do they look like?...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
Well, I don't know.
I know.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
Lester, it just happened.
No --
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Yes I do.
Wasn't sure it was you.
Awww --
Okay, okay...
What do you mean?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
I am?
Of course not.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
Aren't you going to have one?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Anyway, you're crazy.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I guess not.
Don't be silly.
Well, what is it, honey?
It must be something.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
-- Yeah, honey...
How much?
What?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
He does?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- never mind.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Well... sure...
Jill.
Thank you.
John...
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
Come here for a minute, first.
Okay.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
No, Dad.
Good.
Yeah.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Yes.
Is there something bad here?
Room 237?
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yes?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't make any noise.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Where does he go?
Yes, I'd like you to.
Thank you.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
Nice to meet you.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
I did?
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Yeah.
I know it.
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
How do you like it?
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Why?
Why?
Stop it!
Stay... stay away!
Stop swinging the bat.
Get down.
Go away from me.
Go away.
I'm gonna go now.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
Not for me.
They'll love it.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh...
Royalty?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
How do you do?
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Let me help you up.
Will you?
What's that?
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Sure.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Save this one for last.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
No.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
I will- be good, kids.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
LET THY SPIRIT
Yes, Mary?
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
What you do?
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
With love.
What?
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
You did what?
You pig!
Yes?
Joey -- do it.
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
Not in years.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Chops?
The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
That man -- who is he?
It's true -- I know her.
What a shame!
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
What?
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Five a.m.?
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
You watch yourself!
Honey.
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Bless you.
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Enough joking.
Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
The reason?
What?
What?
Deal.
Can do.
The vow of obedience.
A what?
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
No food.  Not until sundown.
And whom would you call?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Come, Sister.
Mary Clarence!
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
I must go where I can be of use.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
Good day.
Saving you.  Move!
Don't push it.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
He didn't do you a favor.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
You son-of-a-bitch!
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
It's a bluff, Vince.
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Not... totally.
What's the problem?
That's what I figured, too.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Yes?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
She wasn't a nun?
But how do we get there?
Impossible.
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
But, Bishop...
I lied.
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
Excuse me?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
... Brom Bones...
Bring Young Masbath here.
What?
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
Should we go back?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
True enough.
Why this tree?
All I saw was their lantern.
Yes.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Take the reins.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
My suitor?
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You are funny.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
It would be interesting to find out.
You made this, and the drawings?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
To avenge his father, and the others.
What has happened?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
It was you there?
What did he say, Katrina?
What would you have me believe?
We have no choice.
No.  She has gone out.
Very little.  I must be going...
What... ?
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
I didn't see none.
Sit.
May I see my mother?
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Sure.
What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.
Yeah.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
He does make some funny noises.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
That might be better than this.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
I thought I told you to keep out!
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
I reckon I feel all right.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
How do you know?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Yeah.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
You want to go with me?
Yeah.
All right then.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
If you want me to.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
I don't reckon I know.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
I reckon.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Is that right?
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Yes sir.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I reckon.
Me, too.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
All right then.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Yeah.
Okay.
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
I believe you. I really do.
All right then.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Not really to speak of.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
Before they were married?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Signs?
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Why?
Yes.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
It's my birthday.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Actually, I'm his father.
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
American literature. What else?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Huh?
Do me a favor, will you?
What's that, Sol?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
It's yours?
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Anything good?
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Every word.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Yeah, probably.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Yeah, like what?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
No you're not.
No, bully for you.
Why don't you open it and find out?
I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Huh?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
And these?
I think I'll take them. 
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
You mean Rashid?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
No thank you.
I figured he had a right to know.
And?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What are you talking about?
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Well, if you put it that way...
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Of course. Where else?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
Yeah, I can believe it.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Drawing's a good thing.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
Two or three nights.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Take good care of yourself, okay?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
Where did you get that thing?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
That's it. In a nutshell.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Well, what if?
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
Carl Heine came.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Won't take two.
You're wondering why I held it.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Fell.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
And what do you believe?
Does it now?
No spare.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
The same.
Sure, anything's poss...
I already said that, b...
<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
For the third time, yes.
Not in those words.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
That's all he said.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
I suppose you want a tip?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
All right, girls - from the top again.
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
We're not?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
With me?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
Knock it off, will you?
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
I never did like the name Geraldine.
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Then pull the emergency brake!
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
What happened?
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like right after the ceremony.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
We're not on the pier yet -
I'm Sugar Cane.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
I'm not that sick.
I have a very low resistance.
How's the bottle?
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
We better have a drink first.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
I hope so.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
No!
Yes.
I always did.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
What's the big idea?
We could dye our hair.
- and you got to be girls.
What's with him - he drinks?
Me too.  Bye now.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Bull fiddle.
Most of the time I slap it.
Wanna bet?
About that roadhouse -
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Flower girl.
We can have it altered.
Well - nobody's perfect.
Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Thank you.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Because I got some plans -
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
Oh.
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Afford it?
Every time!
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Why not?
Want to switch berths with me?
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
That must be it.
Your view of what?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I'm not interested at all.
That's very interesting.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
What theory?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Oh?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Shells?  Whatever for?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
It's all right for a bachelor.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Completely.
They just sort of leave me cold.
What happened?
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
What else is there for me? 
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Tomorrow night?
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
You shave with your spats on?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Okay, Charlie.
What for?
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Are you sure youre okay?
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
If Ed ever found out....
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Last night?
She did?
Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Brilliant.
Youre funny.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
Why?
Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
You stand on your tiptoes.
A wedding.
When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
I guess so.
Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
You have more than one gynecologist?
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Of course, dont be silly.
Meet Nick.
Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Will do.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
What he talk 'bout?
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
You could? How?
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
Nothin'...
Yes, mam...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
She was dirty and wet...
I did look, Charlie, but I--
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Hi to you, son...
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
You bet we is!
Mornin', Daddy...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Yes, David...
I don't look like no possum!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Listen, Mama...
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
I'm used to it.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Might be...
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Little chilly.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
But, Nathan--
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
My head hurts.
Doggy.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Oh.
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Your behind?
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
No you can't Kenny!
Mph mm!
Oh.
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
Eric?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Oh no, it's that kid.
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
Then move out of the way.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Aw, ma!!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
What's the password?
Uhh... Bacon.
Okay.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
For pooping, silly.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Kyle, check it out.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
YOU BASTARD!!
You bastards!!
How do we do that?
I don't know, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Totally!
Wow!
Yeah, so what do we say?
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Yes ma'am!
Right away, ma'am!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Cheers, Terrance!
Canada is saving us!!
Terrance! NO!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Don't call me dumb!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
You better start making sense!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
That's clear.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
You're right.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Simulated space walking.
I understand.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Helllp!
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
You too.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
Hopefully sooner than later.
Over and out.
Marry you?
That's right.  Will you marry me?
Try not to think about it.
So I've been told.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
Send it back if you don't want it.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Talk to him...Jesus...
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
That's affirmative.
Find your bowler?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Can I get you something for the road?
You have orange whips?
It belonged to my dad.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
It's splitsville for you.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
When you get a chance.
La da da dalala...
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
Sure, Sid.
- canker sore.
Seven years.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I'm not on the tour this year.
100 years! 
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Thanks.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I'm your blood.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
I am underground.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
You shouldn't touch her.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Junior who?
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
What if he wants to get out?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Line up where you want it.
Like this?
Yippy!
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Well, that was plan A.
Plan B is your dad.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
What's plan C?
Really? I kinda like it.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
...lane six. Yes.
You got any broken bones?
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
He's my father.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
I am a professional man.
I'm not here to bowl.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
I'm looking for somebody.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
I said back away.
How about I just press the button?
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
How long will that be?
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Nobody move!
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Forty yards.
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Do you see it?
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
-- Wait a second --
It's impossible.
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
Take a look.
What?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Harry?  Can you copy?
Well, where the fuck is he?
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
I'm in charge.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
Internal power.
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What?
What sub?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Wait a minute.
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Beth.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
What are they?
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
You bastard.
It's not worth the risk.
Why should I go?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Still clear.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
None of this was here before.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
What?
You think, in the sphere --
How can the sphere do that?
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Something for burns.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Bingo.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
How do you spell it?
What's that?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
Three to six hours.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
For what?
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
What do you mean, different?
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
No, he isn't.
No, he can't.
Someone did.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
I promise --
Beth --
Don't you know?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Leave me alone, Norman.
I --
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
For whoever's in that thing.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
Look, would you --
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
I don't follow you.
It's like...
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
Norman, where are you?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
You know what it is, Harry.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Hold on.
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying.  There.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Is it?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
What was that, sir?
Captain who?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Unless it's an act.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
I'm not sure.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
I'm not afraid of anything...
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
I'm not going out there.
May the Force be with you.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
That's where my father was killed.
They use the Bogan Force.
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
I'll make a report later.
Was this trip really necessary?
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
You don't believe in the Force?
Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
Not if this tunnel deadends.
With four casualties?!
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
They'll find its weakness.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Are you safe?
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
What an honor...
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
Death to all bugs !
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Others are waiting.
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I got Games & Theory.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Excuse me...!
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
I don't know, Zander.
I do.
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I don't want everyone to see.
It's all I think about anymore.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
How do I know if this is love ?
You two have so much in common.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
I'll go for that.
Alright, I love you.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
That was just a mix up.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Yes, ma'am !
No way, ma'am !
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
How come we never got together ?
You're the best.
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
You got it.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
This time of the year...?
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
I wouldn't mind.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
The Rodger Young just burned up...
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Not a problem.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir...
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Yes, sir !
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
By the Creator.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Engineering...
May I ask Why?
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Aye, sir.
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Mr. Decker... ?
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Tractor beam remains constant...
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
I need a typewritter.
Well, it had sentimental value.
You quit.
It's about life.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Surest thing you know.
...I always thought so...
I <u>can</u>?
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
You going to ask me in?
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
...because if you don't, they die...
I do if you do.
<u>Please</u>...
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him.  She takes his hand...
I told them what you said about the script...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Is it...
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
I'd love to.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
Yes...
...and we could get up every morning...
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
But that's what happened.
Morning.
Water or mineral deposits.
Drama Group?
Go you Huskies...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
That's so beautiful...
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
...why am I here...?
Now: I'm looking at the...
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
That's right.
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Nothing happened.
I loved it...he...
I...
I swear that that woman in my room...
We've got three days to...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Everybody needs a hob...
Just him and me.
I've always seen that.
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
I'm ready!
Could I see it please...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
If there's anything I...
Thank you.
Then what is the...?
Who is her agent...?
Claire, Bob Bar...
You can't do what?
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
The minute I read that script I said...
I know...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Marty...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Yes.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Why?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
Doug, this is Mr...
Doug...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He told you that...
Yes.
What?
You bet he did.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I don't drink.
You want me to lie.
I'm out.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
...would you excuse me, please...
I can write it.  I can't type it.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't...
You didn't see it...
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
How was your flight?
How are you getting on with these fine people?
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
...not the Lazyboy...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
And we're glad to have you here...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
George, that is so kind of you.
And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  I don't mean to be...
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Ain't no second chances in life.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
I don't care.
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
That will never happen.
She knows every neat junk food place.
I bet.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
Good girl.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Let me be the judge of that.
Until he's old enough to read.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Hold lunch!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
That's so weak.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
In high school.
Ice cold water.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Mommy?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
And many meatballs.
No!  I have to get there.
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
How do you know?
I helped.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
You dying.
So where are you?
And when did that pass?
Let's take our best shot.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
But you're not <u>done</u>!
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Me too.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Not to me.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Yes?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
You WHAT?
Luke.  Can't live like that.
How the hell would you know?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
And you said...
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
You mean, after I'm dead?
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
And her...?
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You weren't passing 'em out.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
We have to talk.
So I'll have to order in?
I trust you of course I do but --
They don't hate you --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
I think so too...
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
I needed some time away.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
By way of saying you were unhappy.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
Because you've changed so much.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Oh, yeah?
Hey. What's up?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Oh.
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
Thanks, Scoob.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Nice to have you here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
I'm always working.
This is work.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
My grandchild-baby.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
What's an audience going to tell you?
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
How was the class?
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Thanks.
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Thanks.
Say, 'Nigger.'
'Fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Any books you like to read for fun?
I hate reading.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Hello, is this Pam?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah.
Eight, six, and four.
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
OK. Bye.
Maybe she has caller ID.
How'd you get it?
Yeah. I know.
I mean...
No, thanks.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
What for?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Thanks man.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Y-yes--
Times up!
Why? Are we going dancing?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What happened?
What are you talking about?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Where does it lead?
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
Are you going to kill us?
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
How much do they have?
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
Drop the anchor!
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
I know nothing of the sort!
Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require?  You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
See!  See, I told you.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Didn't they tell you?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
What did you say?
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
No, sir.
You aren't sure!
Do you recognize my voice?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Who do you think you're talking to?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
No, sir.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
That's right, Major.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You know the regulations well, Major.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
You're damned right they are.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
That's close enough, Major.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Why can't you cancel it?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
How long will it take to receive them all?
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Have you tried the recall again?
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
What's the target.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Maybe it's an exercise.
What?
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Call them every five miles.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
I think they mean business.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Primary arming switch.
Very interesting.
Shoot, Lothar.
What's your point, Lothar?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Everything still checks out okay.
Can't "Ace" help you?
Hell, he looks dead.
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
You tell me.
Look, this is different.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Have you tried the emergency system?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Roger.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
How long were you in there?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Mm-hm.
Was it okay?
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
No I quit.
Yup.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Right now?
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Where are you-hoo?
Yeah.
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
The dude wants it.
Sorry.
A long, long, long...
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
She's in the van.
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Oh, you were in the band?
Mm. And your like, what else?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Please!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Glad it's okay.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Good. See you later.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Please.
Yeah!
Come on. Inside.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-mm.
Mm.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Let's see.
Erica.
It's a mistake to think that.
I'm sorry.
Oh, sure.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Ask your girlfriend.
Good. That's good.
That chick, Erica?
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
I hit her.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Oh, shit.
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
I don't know.
No.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Look, your trespassing.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!
I hate that.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Man?
One!
But do you stand for anything?
It got that close.
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
How?
Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Mm.
Yeah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, really.
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
I don't know.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Oh!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Yeah?
You do not!
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Would I get paid?
I'm moving.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Where do you get your ideas?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah.
Hey, Tim.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
You know the fuck not.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Conan went to Harvard.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Wayne Gretzky.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
No...I've been pregnant.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Positive.
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I sure do.
Trix...
Mmm-hmmm...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Well, I want to know what happened --
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
My what?
Now how the hell can I help you?
My best friend got pregnant.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Roll 'em.
Action! The scene starts.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
What's wrong with it?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
As for instance?
Well....
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Are you hungry?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Phillip, you're mad!
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
What teacher?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Why should you do that?
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
So do I.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
If you please.
Twenty-two.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't want it now.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
If you love me, Joe.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
Yes, I did.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Get out!
Why?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
And you'll play Salome?
Fair enough.
This is fascinating.
I will not have it butchered.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Where do you live?
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
They've come for my car.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Just follow me.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
What's that?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
When did he say it, Norma?
Good night.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Why do you say that?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Yes, I am, Norma.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
No, they don't.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
That's what I told them.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Frankly, no.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Yes.  Madame.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Eliminate her.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Western Europe.
It's for your own protection.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Who didn't?
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
What do you feel about me?
No.
Well...I guess one is all right.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
That makes it worse.
She'll forget about us eventually.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
I did.
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
I bet they do.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
A passionfruit smoothee.
I'll drink to that.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
You vicious--
Yeah.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Why George, are you proposing?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
The scoop of the year!
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You're supposed to guess.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
I don't understand.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Thank you. You're very kind.
Must've been a defective puck.
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
He's nice.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You're wasting your breath.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
I don't scare that easily.
For what?
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
What? Palace? Hardly.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Why?
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad?
Brad Wilson.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
The kid needs a man to show him --
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
Oh...I came close once.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Can I help?
Well, aren't you excited?
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Oh. You're going away.
Kent!
Mom and I do this all the time.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
What are you doing?
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
Yeah. A raise . .
The boss wants to see you.
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Black or regular?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
When?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
God, that's what I keep you for.
KRYPTONITE!
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
What will it do?
Everything.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
What she call you?
It was hot!
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
But the bridge...
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Diet soda?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
In other words, push this red button.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
53!
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
A normal person.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Actually, yes.
Really?
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
I'm listening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Say you love me.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
What else is ballast for?
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
My kind of people.
Where?
To ski?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
He ran in fear from us . . .
What more?
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Stay. I will come to you.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
I really don't think . . .
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
What about here?
. . . Let me get my purse.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Clark . . . wait!
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Politely?
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
I'll try. . .
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
The one Superman wrecked up?
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You're just an experiment, freako!
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
I am master now.
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
I know.
I will.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Unbelievable.
What the  --  !
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Oh.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Is that what they're calling him?
No thanks.
Besides that.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
So I've noticed.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
You think he's for real?
Tough guy, huh?
You're on.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
La de da da...
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
Ready.
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
What other one?
You can't do this to me!
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
But so is Vond-El
Two.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
Lara, please...
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
I guess I got carried away
Twenty-four.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I came to talk to you.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Oh.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Very much.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I guess I...uh...regressed.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
But...why?
Of time, Luthor.
Maybe I should get help.
On radio waves?
And garbage doors.
They'll soon be over.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
Which one?
But you said...
She's in trouble?
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Alison.
I will.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
They just finished supper.
I'm not sure.
The children.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
Your kids never cry.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Sure.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Because I have to.
Yes.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
About the Ottos?

From what?
Berry-picking.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
What do you mean?
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
Billy said that?
I did.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Why would he be frightened?
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
No.  A little sugar though.
Did he say what about?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
The people in the town?
So he was mean?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
I'm absolutely positive.
Was the bus on time?
I object to that form of question. Note that.
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
Crafts.
Crafts?
Almost three.
Perfect.
So what's the problem?
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
Yes.
I'm a lawyer.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Excuse me?
No.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Why were you scared?
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
Really?
You mean it?
Nothing.
It's okay.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
But you didn't lose me.
Great.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Give me a chance --
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
I don't believe it.
Can I come in for a minute?
You print them, don't you?
When?
Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
Get Steve back his job...please...
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I read your column every day...
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Why not you?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
We stick in each others craw.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
What ship?
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
Those lying motherfuckers!
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
Now listen to me very carefully.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
You sure?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Why?
What?
Chill out, dickwad.
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
No problemo.
Drive faster.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Go!  I'll finish here.
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Unknown.
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
Yes.
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess it's possible.
What's that mean?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
and totally irrelevant.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Colonel. Pleasure.
Not yet.
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Yes.
Your mother, too.
No. Ours was damaged.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
I can't do this. It's not right.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I don't buy that.
It's the truth.
Tough, tough!
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
What did Goering say?
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
And what did he say?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Yes, that's what happened.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Who's conducting?
Me? Never.  Never.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
How could I know what's in the archive?
Yes, you remember.
Do it, Helmuth.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
What?
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
Sure.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Absolutely not.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Alright!
I won't let the fat kid down.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
I hate the beige one.
You must have a girlfriend.
Aha!  Is she young?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
I don't understand...
Freezing.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
You'll learn.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Why?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
That's the way it was told to me.
That's not my mission.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
You must have had a fun child-
My whole life has been combat.
Not possible.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
No.  Never.
Kyle...
You're not supposed to.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
Surrounded by living tissue.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I can't sleep.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I hate the weird ones.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Call her.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
What?
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I apologized, I offered to help.
I'll be right with you.
Don't just stand there, get help!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
A game?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Why not?
If there was one.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
What's C.R.S.?
Yes... well...
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Come here...
Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
Nicholas...
Get out of my car!
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know.  A lot.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
What... what do you mean?
It's out of your hands.
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
What are you doing?
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Nicholas...
That's not true...
Stop it!
Claire.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Like... where are you from?
Single?
Boyfriend?
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Never better.
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Why?
This isn't an escort service?
Call them.  Trust me.
Okay.
Slow down, take a breath...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Do you know how to change a tire?
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Robbed?
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
I'll call.  I really will.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
No.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
You're joking.
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
What about the house?
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Yeah.
I've read your tests.
Go ahead.
There's a carriage house around back.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Does she know that's why you're using her?
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Well... we're glad to have you.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
And then what happened?
It was.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
That?  That's Hill House.
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
How could you do this to people?
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
So far.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
You're okay.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
Why?
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
Is that a problem?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
Our black friends?
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Eduardo.  Rama.
You're home, then.
No reason.
This ain't your lot?
Where abouts?
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
One thing I need.
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Not her brand.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Try calling me again.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Ashamed.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
That's what was estimated.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
I can see the attraction.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
What about your grandmother?
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
How far?
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Where is he now?
He had urgent business in the north.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Makin' trouble for someone?
Which kind?
Good luck.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
That don't mean nothin'.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
How we gonna get that lucky?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
I miss my kids.
-- You know his name is Frank.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Tell me.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
Ann. Will you come in?
Ann--
Yeah. Thanks.
That's what he keeps telling me.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Look, I'm no expert, but--
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Ah... it's nothing.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
Birdy--
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
Sure.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
That'll be fine.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.
...You know... who *who* is?
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Come on in.
Big Dave--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Honey?
Honey...
How are you?
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
I took Doris's keys.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
Sure you don't need one?
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Yeah.
Huh?
This hair.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
What the--
You don't got a headache?
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
We're just closing, friend.
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Ah.
Under arrest for murder.
It better be good.
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
I appreciate that.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
I don't want to scare people.
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
Oh Jesus...
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
I believed them.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Dr. Green has to see you!
Oh shit.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
What are they?
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Read it out loud.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
I don't believe it.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
What is it?
I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Holy mother, what is that?
What?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
You have time to talk?
How did you know that?
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
I don't understand.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
What was it?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
Vince!
How?
The answer's right in front of us.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I have to shoot.
You have to.  Do it now!
One.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
It's the busy season.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
What's on the ClockCam?
All prop cars accounted for?
What music?
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Do it!
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Of course.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on "Tru Talk."
I'm the creator.
You think she'd go through with it?
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Saturday?
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
I can't tonight.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Really?
What's that?
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
Oh, my God!
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Should I?
There's been an accident, Truman.
I bet you did.
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
--Darling--
Things always do--when you look back.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Were you there--how do you know?
Good.  Good.
Yes.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Of what?
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Have you examined them?
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Old friend of your father's.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Not according to the men in blue.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What did it look like?
You didn't know my father --
Did you find something?
It's locked?
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
All I told them was the truth.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
Get dressed, Scully.
According to this tag.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
All the equipment is brand new.
This is great. This is fitting.
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
Mulder --
I have no idea.
Very weird.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
I need you on this, Scully --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
General McAddie's.
I don't know anything about that.
Thank you.
About what?
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Where is he?
Driver.
What alien environment?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Lucien Baines?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Shush.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'll be fine.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
How hard could it be...?
No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
What then?
Peter, okay?
What did you see?
I did, yeah.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
Little boy?!  That's him!
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
It doesn't matter...
's broken.
I need you to find something in the basement...
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Initiating connection.
Sometime yesterday morning.
Yes.
Absolutely.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
What about narcotics?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I doubt that.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Completely unaware.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
No.  Can you get a man close?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Were you at the inquest?
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Well you read this.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the matter?
What are you going to do?
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
I saw him today.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
No.
He works in a military hospital.
No.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
It's true then?
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Where's Harry?
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
How will I know you?
Fellow called Lime.
Martins.
No, sorry.
I can't say that I have.
What are you trying to say?
He was...
Ever seen one?
Pin it on a...
It wasn't petrol.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Getting around, Martins.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
Calloway.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
I see.
Which side of the road?
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
You all did.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
One can't just leave - please.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Oh, Mr. Martins...
I'll look it up for you.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
No, a major, were you really?
Certainly.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
Did the police believe you?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
What do you want?
Zwei zwartze.
Here?
A Roumanian.
Will you give me...
What's the name of this girl?
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Yes.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
Hear the details.
In great pain?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Must be some mistake.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
What's he saying?
You saw it?
Who else?
Now, hold on.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
Well make it your business.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
He didn't want to get involved.
Not necessarily.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Never.
His name?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Good morning.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Nice work.
One or two kilometers.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
No.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
Uh-huh.
No one follows that midrash.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Yes.
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I don't, but...
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You will.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Are they still together?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Killing himself.
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
Why won't you talk to me?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
What's it mean?
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
I'm good at languages.
Why not?
That's stupid.
Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
With you there's a tragic dimension.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Do they?
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I didn't realize you cared.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I'll go look....
What'd you say?
I'm stealing it.
Obviously.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
How would you kill him?
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
And? WHat did you notice?
I don't know. Is that right?
Why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Listen to me....
Give me a reason not to.
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
What were you, following me?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
This is me.
How did you...?
You're lying.
Think about your father. Your sister.
Don't tell me what I --
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Balint?
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Get out of here....
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Why? Why would she?
So what do we do with the device?
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
Are you an artist?
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Exactly.
Leary?
No.
Obviously.
Valentine...
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
Eat shit....
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Yes.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Of course.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
What kind?
... So am I.
No!
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Yes...
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
Enzo!
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
That idiot!
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
And where did you say you were from?
Fine!
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
... You married?
People say that?
Not at all!
Your mother?
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Thank you, thank you very much!
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
You say that because you have the title!
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Who?
... Especially the sneakers.
Give it to me.
... The way she moves.
I don't know, I just feel it.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
I'm still here.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You'll understand.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
I saw how it has to be.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Anything.
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
He doesn't hear too well.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
... Sally?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Then, goodbye.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
I know sir. I won't let you down.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Yeah, no kidding.
Sure. Why not.
I said, do you come here often!?
Yes Esther.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
I'll be in my office.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
That's some cold shit.
No, it was the perfect level.
Why not -- if you like it - if that's what you really want.
I don't know -
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
What about me?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
I don't know.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Let's get in your truck.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
You found the leopard!
What are you doing that for?
Go on -
What, senorita?
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Good evening.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
I want to ask you something.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
More or less.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Some other time.
Then you found the leopard --
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Why?
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
I know. Funerals.
Yes. Do you mind?
That doesn't make sense.
You. Us.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
How do you know?
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
What... What are you talking about?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Excuse me?
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Paul Lamont...?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
Sorry?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Is there anything to understand?
You bastard...
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
To get me killed...?
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
No. Not us...
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Can you tell me how you spell...
Crow what?
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
You...  Jesus Christ!
By your Austrian?
No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I know where to look.
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. Its all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what weve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen.
May I have your phone number?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Tomorrow?
You... Fuck you!
...On holiday?
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where are the kids?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Got it. Puppies.
Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about 100 but he said itd be worth it.  Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Its not.
Well, Im sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay.
Your secretary, huh!
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
Okay. Recommended...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need. 
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
Is my money in there?
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
You seem very sure about that.
What are you talking about?
Have you?
You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - youre the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Good reasons?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
... No.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Hows the boy doing?
No...
I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Excuse me?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
What about which girlfriend?
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Tu sais o me trouver.
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Cost what?
Costliest!
What do you think?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Of course I am, it's just that...
10,000 gold crowns.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I thought you were an archer?
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Yes...
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Tell the king to give me more men.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
To marry you.
One day you will.
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
No...
No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I don't remember.  Maybe.
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
To avoid killing anyone.
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
I'll be right here... I promise.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Not long ago...
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
Silence her!  Take her away...!
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
... You look wonderful...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
What difference does it make where she comes from?
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
The other half.
... as always, majesty...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Go and ask him yourself.
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
The bridge won't wait!
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Damn right!
Good idea...
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Jeanne, look behind you.
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
I... submit to Our Lord.
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
That's now what I meant...
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
My king.
Playing...
I -- I -- I...
I might ask you the same question.
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
God asked you to do something?
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
In His name??
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Really?
No, I...
I don't think so.
Are you going to leave me too?
Are you sent by God?
Yes, my lord.
So... alright.  What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Yes, it is.
What... does he... look like?
I want to be at one with Him now.
Who wants me to stop?
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Who are you?
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
I'll see you...soon.
He'll be here soon.
How will we sleep?
I'll be fine.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
What, I'm working, what?
Can you help us?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, please.
That makes a change.
That's better than yesterday.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
I can look after myself!
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Yes, but what good did it do?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
Pig!
Pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
I'm not going anywhere.
No, I don't think so?
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
Where do you live?
In the attic.
Show me.
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
There is something to be said for silence
No, no bible readers.
Yes
The piano.
The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
Nothing just yet
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
No, words. You have never heard words?
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
Hello.
You've missed this bit.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
You got a bag or somethin?
Here.
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
I think it's the best...
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
That's the way I want it.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
We'll be waitin'.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Shove off, Duff.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
Forget it.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Which one?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Good lad.
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
I can talk, can't I?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
No, not a thing.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
Did he say he wouldn't?
He'll show.
It was too noisy.
Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.
Then why you doin' it?
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
I also gotta win.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
See and raise five.
You're more gutless than I thought.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Who are you?
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Where's June today?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Where you goin'?
Sixty-five.
2:00 A.M.
Yeh, sleepin'.
He'd like to kill me.
Yeh, this time anyway.
Okay, Tootsie.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Maybe a couple million.
I am after this race.
Why don't ya then.
How am I gonna do that?
I don't know, figure something out.
Don't think I know him.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Yes.  He admitted it.
He's just around the corner.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Don't cry.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
What are you talking about?
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Dorothy!
You're high enough.
Give it to me.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
Now do you believe me!
Did he tell you where he was going?
Hello, there!
Yes.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Yes.
Probably not.
I don't know.
That's the truth.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
I know -- I know --
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Not a thing.
What's that to you?
Nothing.
I'll have to try to remember.
That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
Man to man, I'm not.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Who's your candidate?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about Jorgensen?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
Extraordinarily lucky.
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Why yes.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Goodbye.
Want to take a poke at him?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I couldn't go near that woman.
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Yes?
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
No.
Well, let me do that for you.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
I didn't knock Julia off.
This is your party.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
If you like 'em like that.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
By the way, how is your father's side?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
Santa Claus.
What are you drinking?
Rye.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
At breakfast.
Well, didn't you?
You did.
You must admit I have good taste.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
You talk as if I were Asta.
Maybe I will.
I don't believe he did it.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Sure.
Couple of months anyway.
No.  Nobody but you.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects!  They won't come.
Mimi!
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
Why are you saying it?
I hope you're well.
You worked here?
Trying to put it off on her?
You his wife?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
No, please, not again.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Picks up again just on the other side.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
So we wait.
Move!
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
I told you; don't push me around.
You don't know that.
You don't know he isn't.
We're at war.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
I out rank you, that's why.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Knock it off!
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Wait.  Wait.
But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
Wh-what do you think--
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Let's go.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
We leave it.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
Mine.
I heard it.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
Shut up and listen!
It's a fire fight.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
They can't shoot us in here.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Get up and dig.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
What?
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
How!?
I don't want to die.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
Just let me rest for a second.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
And then what?
And then shoot them.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
Shi'ites, I think.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Then I'm a rich man.
Yeah.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Really?
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
It doesn't mean anything.
At-at-at-at-at.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.
How the hell should I know how much?
Oh, God!
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Yeah, we're down.
All last night he could have been--
I'm not wasting my water on him.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Stress category.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
What happened?
No, Tetanty.
Now?
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
I don't know.
You don't know.  You don't....
Don't let them separate us.
They're watching us now.
No one can see us now we're alone.
Impossible!
What?
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
Right now.
Look!
All the insides are gone!
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
No?
...to me.  I think I'm dying.
You should know better than that!
They're not here.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Go ahead.
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
Mike Reilly.
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Drive.
Then let's go see what they missed.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Yep.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Why do you do it?
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Where you guys at?
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Which one's which?
Right.
Hey, I'm next.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Take him!
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
What about the ballistics report?
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Insurance?
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Shit. We're fucked.
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
It's about this.
What?
IRA - instant retirement account.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Report on the case so far.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Very well, Jacques.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
But--
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
You're looking fine, Major.
Like it?
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Good day, Major.
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
No--proud. Very proud!
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
The fourteenth of May.
What?
Certainly!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
He recognized you!
Spanish passports?
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Not particularly.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
The pleasure is mine, madame.
What's wrong now?
Do you realize I have light eyes?
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
The same thing.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Um-hum ...
Um-hum ...
How do you like my dress?
Beautiful.
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
Call the police?
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Mariette!
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
<u>Adolph</u>?
Adolph J. Giron.
Divine ...
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
What is it, madame?
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
Please!  Thank you.
Right!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Didn't you take it with you?
Yes, I saw it--but--
That's right.
The pumps --
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Lewis...
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Don't you mean work me?
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
...Mrs. Calvert?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
I felt like black.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
Almost as good as you.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
I've got you. I won't let go.
Could I speak to you in private?
Jack.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
She had beautiful hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Just move with me. Don't think.
A mistake?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Jack, I --
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
He couldn't have.
I know, I know.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
I can't feel my body.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
I should like to see my drawing.
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
It's so unfair.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
Sure!
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Will you leave me alone?
Baloney!
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Where's Lother?
Not at all.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Sure!  Excuse me.
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
I'll say she is!
I could stand some more--
Brett is the name.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Very--your mother?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
You mean that?
Don't let's talk about it.
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Who with?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
What's the matter?
Shortie, look!
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Now you're talkin'!
Are you screwy?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
You take some awful chances.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Where did you hide it?
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
I'll go with you.
Swell!
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
What'll I say?
How?
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
So what?
Well, did you find me?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Are you happy?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting-- 
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
Do what--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
I'll never love anybody else.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very serious?
Very--
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
You don't shoot squirrels.
I'm getting seasick--
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
--you'd go with him!
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
No!
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Why?
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Thank you.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Hey--you! Where you going?
Because you ran after me.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Absolutely nothing.
I don't understand.
Well I'm not so go home.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Good.  That's real good.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
In pace requiescat.
I was kidding about that.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
But Doc-
No...
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
Revenge?  For what?
How you feelin', Doc?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
What?
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
I don't.
What?  But I saw 'em-
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
There's no reasoning with him.
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I laugh sometimes
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Fortuitous even.
I hate Sadie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Oh, all right.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
I need it.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
That what you got me up here for?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
'Least they don't scare women.
We'll see about that.
I'll be damned...
Yeah?
What're you talkin' about?
I know.  And nobody can make him.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
You're on.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
But she doted on the frowner
Acquired?
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
I can feel your pain.
Your choice.  Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
I know what I saw -
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Who knows? Fog, night...
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Interesting video tape.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Of course.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Let's not make it a habit.
Think about mom.
- The family jewels?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
You are seriously deranged.
Are you listening to me?
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
We blast through.
... Yes?
Now.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Remind me.
Who's Wade?
Captain Morton.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
That's a lie.
We got the same thing.
Yes.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
What is it, noontime?
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Babe Brother.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
I'm busy.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
Not anymore, not in the city.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
You all act like two roosters.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
What happened to your hand?
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
It's only a tale.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Now who are we talking about?
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
I already have, my dear.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
What must I do?
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Where is Skip?
You know the man next door is near death.
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
No, I haven't seen him.
Okay...
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Woody!  Buzz!
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Rocky!  The ramp!
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
You can't!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Shield your eyes!
Shhh!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Woody!
Look out!!
Hold still, Buzz!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
What's with him?
I can't see a thing!
Oh no, Hannah!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
I was close to being scared that time.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Sir!  No Sir!
Yes SIR!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
I can't quite make out -- 

That's right.  Your toys.
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Didn't you know he made things?
Get away from me...
Living with him put years on me.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Did you now.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
I can't find Manolo.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Arnie, thank God.
Why are you talking like that?
What is he being charged with?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Carl --
Goodbye Arnie.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Oh, it is?
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Honey, your father knows the President.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Not yet.
I got that.  How was your day?
Helena --
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Parents still together?
I'm third in my class.
I get A's.  All A's.
Not like.  It is.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Yes, mom --
I feel good.
Who do you work for?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Arizona.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
We can protect you.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
So go shower already.
We aren't barbarians.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Yeah.
I don't know.  Something.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
We keep our mouths shut.
Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
She hasn't called you?
You won't say anything to my parents?
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
What do you mean?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm sorry.
Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
Shag her senseless.
You've stabbed me, man.
Ninteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Where are you going, Diane?
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Sorry.
Jesus.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Can I see you again?
The point is, you've got to find something new.
So why have you told me about it?
What? Steady like?
Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Fuck, OK.
Do you recall the school motto?
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
Spud, they're my sheets.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Yeah.
But try too hard --
Exactly.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Say something, Mark, say something --
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
Oh no, don't even mention it.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Excellent.
As you wish.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
That's fair enough.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
What?
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
It could. Yes.
He doubts me.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Raise shields.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
And that is?
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Are we leaving, Captain?
Jim.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Bones.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Who is it he reminds you of?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Fascinating.
Damn.  Let's go.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
To land any closer would risk detection.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If you think it would help.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
He did have pointed ears.
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
"c."... "k."
It must be all those marsh melons.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
The emergency channel, open.
Not possible. You were never alone.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No. I refuse.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
No special conditions?

  

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
No. I will not.
I know you better than that.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Want one?
I know, I met him.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Okay, okay...
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
Yeah...?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
If you think -
It can be arranged...
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Greetings, program...
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Then...
Stranger and stranger...
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not us, I hope.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
How 'bout yourself?
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Alan-One...
We have to talk.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Do it!
As long as it gets us out of here
Then I owe you some thanks...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
It's something Users do.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
Out.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
You're kidding.
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
Roger, One.  Rolling.
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
Will you just open the door!					*
Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, but for who?							*
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Here they come.
No!  Never!
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Yes sir.
Yes what?
Uh, yes, it is important.
Good thinking, honey.
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
They said you had to run out.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
Yes.
No.
Yes or no.
I can do it!
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
Natasha?
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Sure, hon.
I'm not wearing any.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
Do you still love me?
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
What about the husbands?
Go ahead.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Yes.
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
I'm sorry, I can't.
What is it you need me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
No.  He checked out okay--
His wife.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Ya looked through it?
Sonny kicks ass.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
Sure. Why not?
What do you want to know?
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
What's your favorite color?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
What are your turn-ons?
Turn-offs?
How long have you worked here?
That's a long time.
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
What would make you think that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Uh-huh.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
What?
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Why?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
You don't know him -
What?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
Why Cancoon?
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
You'd really do that?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Get the fuck outta here!
I'm a married man.
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
Good for you.
Every word of it.
I know.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot Blitzer.
What's to think about?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Yeah?
In case.
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
They'll be along.
I guess so. Follow me.
Yeah?
No. Not yet.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
What?
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
No shit?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
Sure.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
You and Robin moved?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Do you believe him?
But a fuckin' baggie.
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
He saw the wire.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Rock whores.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Put it in your pants.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
Well, you go down Beechwood...
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I didn't mean -
Donowitz, he said.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
And your only goal is...???
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I need to go.
Do you know why you're here, James.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
It's so clean.  No germs.
I have to go.
What year do you think it is?
No, 1995 is the past.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
You're sure?
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
You... you left them a message?
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
You know -- your plan.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
I'm here about some monkeys.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call.  I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... "weird" war we were in.  You remember that?  Here, take it, man!  You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
Hey, man...
Yes, sir.
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
Maybe I do.
I think I've heard that before.
Think you'll live that long?
You afraid of the dark?
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
Nothing.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
It will.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Out of here.
Where in Mexico would you like--
One way, or round trip?
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Nope.  Darrell.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
How much?
How much!?
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You got the money?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Yes.  Yes it is.
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
They look nice.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
When did you buy a gun?
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Maybe I don't want you to.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
What happened to your hand?
You should be more careful.
No trouble at all, really.
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Least you can leave.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Thank you.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Those are white words, not ours.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
You know what I want.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is it pretty?
We'd have to kill him.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
There is no us, remember?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I could if I had Jake's money.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
There has to be!
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Just drive.
Now what?
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.
Can you climb back up.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Someone will find me.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I did?
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
And what does that make you?
I need thirteen.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
And tell her what?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
You think that's a lot of money?
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
It's not like that.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
Not from where I stand.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I said come on!
What?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
You expect me to believe that?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Stand up.
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
A hundred-forty-five really.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
I didn't do anything.
Senor, you need a doctor.
Christ no!
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Stand up.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Yeah...
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
About what you said this morning.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
How about I pick one out for you?
Cause she's dead.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
How old are you?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Yep.
But he's dead.
So?
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Darrell--
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
How much!?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
You got the money?
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
Eh?
I'm just going to my car?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
What happened to your hand?
You should be more careful.
That's all right.  I got it.
You're welcome, Grace.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
The same thing you do.
Beautiful?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Yeah.
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I'm not coming back.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
But I thought --
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
You could give me my gun back.
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Harlin's.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
One way, or round trip?
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Genuine Draft?
Sure, I'll try.
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Wrong number.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
There's someone in the house.
Like you helped her, Jake?
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
I want my lawyer!
Is Noel in?
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
I had to put him down.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
He's asleep.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
No that's it.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
You've misunderstood.
Are you for real?
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
Is there a problem?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
That's not what I witnessed David.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Yes he is.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I won't make any noise.
Just one--
What things?
I'm going to work out.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Okay.
Fine.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
Why?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Like whores?
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Thank God.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
You ain't dead.
Scouting?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
Be careful with those, sonny.
Oh yeah.
He admit it?
Uh... a little, maybe.
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
They really got all that money, them whores?
Like I said, I...
Give it to him.
Did you... kill him?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
N-no, sir?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
Jesus!
She's passed on, Kid.
Huh?
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
I got him.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah.
First one what?
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
We all got it comin', Kid.
You ain't shot.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Yeah.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
I could tell you who was last, mister.
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Well, she...
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
He's dead, Bill.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
Well, I come back, didn't I?
Who said that?
Thought you was followin' me.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
More.
He's blind, for Chri...
I don't like the question.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Yeah?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
I'm having a stroke.
They just said they wanted time.
Umm ...
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
This whole thing was a shakedown.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
You are a criminal.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
They fucking know everything.
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
County. I was in for fraud.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
If you'll just let me -
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Fenster and Hockney?
Maybe more.
We'll make it.
Who's Keyser Soze?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
What if I
What time is it?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Tell him we'll meet.
Someplace else, then.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
You know damn well what I think.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
I don't.
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
But Keaton...
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
He wanted me to live.
Edie.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Keaton was Keyser Soze
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Four cases in three years ...
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
How did you settle on the amount?
It looks that way.
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
What does it mean?
Yes.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
We went to Code Blue...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
Neurology?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
What book is that?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
Huh!
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
Just now...
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
That's not my handwriting.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I am on the staff of...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
...I made a reservation at...
Yes.  I wrote it.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Right.  Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
No.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
I was held up.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
That's perfectly all right.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Ready, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Is this a bad time.
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
Where is he?
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
What do you want?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...I have to stand up for her...
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
No.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Right.
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
Oh shit, what's today?
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
That's right.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
What did she do?
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
... I know.  I went ...
... You saw her?
... I understand ...
... I understand ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
Four.  You're great with these kids.
Who told you that?
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
One hour.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We, we were rather busy...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
How'm I doing so far?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Where'd she go?
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
And when she goes to those places...
She is not my wife.
What happened?
She... went into the Bay.
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
About three years.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Salina, Kansas!
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
An hour?
I'll take care of you.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes --
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.
No!
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Yes!
Your accident...
I don't know... Switzerland?
Some money.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
No...
Do you remember where you were?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You like it, too.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Good-bye.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
No.
No, thank you.
Where?
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
A grave...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
I know.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
All the time.
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
Only this far.
Tell me.
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
It's all there. It's no dream.
No, never!
I love you too... too late... too late...
Where?
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Why?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What's tomorrow?
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
What a pleasant hobby.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Sorry, old man. Work.
My... the acrophobia.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Yeah.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
I'll take you home.
Bye-bye!
Just wander.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
No, not exactly. Want to see?
Oh?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Well...
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Don't touch her. Call 911.
What?
What's that?
She's dead.
Playing?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
What did you say?
Don't point at me.
I have plenty of friends.
Eat my ass!
You fucking bastard!
Go home!
You go home!
What do you think you are doing?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Sure, why not.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
So I didn't fucking do it!
What?
Don't talk to me about character.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
They won't figure it out.
I got children. I've got a life.
They're singing.
Later.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Are you solid with that?
I know and I'm honored...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Lois please.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
That's right.
Fish?
Here's his head.
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
Shut up.
Call 911.
I'm calling the police.
What kind of words?
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
What did you ask me?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What?
Suck my ass.
What does that mean?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You're sick.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
You need help.
It's my fucking opinion.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
I never heard that.
Israel doesn't have a King.
Then what do they have?
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
I love you.
I do.
I don't think so.
What do you mean, you think so?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You forgot the tent?
Why what?
He's a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
What are you talking about?
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
He's weird.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
You will not be common!!!
With all my heart.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
I will.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Have a nice bachelor party.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Where are you?
How late?
What about the chairs?
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
We're not canceling.
I won't even discuss it.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
The prostitute.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Like how?
No...
But...
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
So?
Go for it.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
Buzzing?
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
Yup.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
Downstairs in the closet.
Did he try to kiss you?
All week long.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
That's what I'm thinking.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
"You Send Me."
Oh I know that. How does it go...
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
So where to on the honeymoon?
Drum banging real times.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, the children sleep with me.
Yes, yes.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
It's a present from my parents.
What's that?
What about them?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Was that difficult to get?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Don't you ever see him?
How could anybody behave like that?
And this innocent child.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Yes.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Fifteen yards.
That's good land.
He was asking for it.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
No.
Stop this!
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
Very, very?
All right, Mother.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Mother.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
Good, then let's go!
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
No, I don't want to.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
Me? What did I do?
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
Catch him and your record's clean.
But only you will know he's not human.
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?
He was a computer program for crissake.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
I need your help--
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
What did you find out?
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
Help me get out of here.
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
As a matter of fact, it is.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Relax. I know what you meant.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Authority still makes me nervous.
You're not capable of it.
Part of him is.
My guess is dead.
I don't know.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
Duck!
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
My...secret.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.

Okay.  And she's alleging...?
All I need is the one day.
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
What would do that...?
I'm working on it.

Tell me again.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.

Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
How's your wife?
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.

If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Whaddaya think?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Why do people go to war?
Would you go to War to do that? 
I have.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.

That's from the ... it's got to be from the...

Why Albania?
I'm sure they do.
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
We don't need an Act Two.
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
W...what?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket

"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.

We're going home.  We're going home together...
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?

Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
They look stupid.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Yes.
Fine.  Good.
The hats.
Why a beret?
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
"...the special detachment..." Good!  What is it?

What about tipping off Yurovich?
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Coulda been a contender.
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
How's Mom?
Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Don't start, alright.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
You sure?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
So what firm you with, pal?
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
Allright. Wait here...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
You're learning, sport...
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Where is it?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Break it.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
And what do you want?
Well, why stop at that?
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Why?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
...how do you know? You wish...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Old values. Buy.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
It's over you, Gordon.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You got it, G.G.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
With Mark?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Good evening sir.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Vell.  Goodnight.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
A little?
Safety in numbers man.
Hi there Sarah
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
YES!
I know that.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
That's not true.
What?
Then why did you?
Your husband?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Your friend saw them.
You think you influenced her?
I am.
Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
The wives.
I don't know.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
That's not...It's not like that.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Wait!  Don't go...
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
No.  No, I don't.
Yeah.
Claire.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
I should be going anyway.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Absolutely.
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Seance.
Please.  That's all I need.
I don't...
The planchette?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
I was down in Adamant...
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
I guess not.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Nice.  Almost done.
Wanna fool around?
Mmm.
Tomorrow.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
Claire...
It's what I've been working for.
Is it gone?
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
Of course.
What kind of whispering?
Yep.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
That's...
What's going on, Claire?
What?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
It's a ghost.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Five minutes?
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
This is the Feur thing?
We had a seance.
Who did?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Sweetheart--
Claire, please...
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
You told me that I was...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
...Please stop...
STOP IT!
Stop...
I'm not going to listen to this.
You should have tried harder.
Look for antiques...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
You don't have to do that.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Shhhh.
Two heartbeats.
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Come.  There is a lot to read
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Rowan.
Michael, Rowan should -
Nothing was ever more false.
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
He made that quite clear, yes.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
I don't want it.
Then you wear it.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Who is this...?
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
The lamplight.  That's all.
Better than most, I suppose.
You're a monster.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
FAST.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?

I bring her flowers too.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
Only you...
I do not understand...
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
My jury's still out on that,
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
Really...?  Your family there...?
Captain's orders.
You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
Mad. for each other.
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
- a witch.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
That's GREAT!
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Mm-hmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
I don't know.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
No.
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
If you like that type.
Is that what you were doing...?
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
A person could get killed round here just for working late
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Yes it is...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Yes - I have had it for years.
Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
The touch?
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
I think I will pass...
And how many people have you killed?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
I don't know...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
then why did you marry her -
Why not? Please - it would help me
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Yes - I suppose so...
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
I think you had better leave
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
No - a dentist
Oh...
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
You and your pep talks.
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
That's crazy talk.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Give me those!
You'll never believe who's in there.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
Yeah?
If you don't have...I mean...
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Which you pulled, hard!
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Dad, please.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Well, why should I?
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
You ordered a Winnebago?
Some of them have to be automatics.
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Hmmm?
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
You mean they knew who I was?
My legacy.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Just a formality.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
To the best hiding place in the world.
I see.
I doubt it.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
Your dad taught you everything.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
You're amazing.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
He's on the move?
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Come on.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Let your fingers do the walking.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Forget the store. Think big.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
People pay good money for that?
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan...
I... You know... I...
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
I'd like that.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
I know you do.
You mean he withdrew...
Try, Kelly.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
We don't know that, Ray...
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
Where's Lombardo?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Yeah... okay... he did
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I said he did.
I'm sorry?
What?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
What brain?
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
No thanks to you.
Where, the mall?
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
You know what it takes.
God, I've been calling you.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
Okay.  I love you too.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
That's cop bullshit.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Didn't you see her this morning?
Funny.  So am I.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Is this leading somewhere?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
That's right... That's good.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
What?  President Grant is...!
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
Yes, me!
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Really?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
My... the wild west.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
Fine, I'll stop.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Nicely said, sir.
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Philistine.
Yes!
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
What is Tir Asleen?
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Not today, Willow.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I love you.
Madmartigan.
He's no magician.
Miserable Pecks.
I have to give this baby to some- body.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Who?
She's a bird, Willow.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Then I will teach you.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Courage, Willow.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Here.  Hold her.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Milking?
I've seen pictures.
They're Amish.
Try the house.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Sure have, Sam.
Yeah.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
It's not a joke.
We do not go into your courts.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
I would not be too sure.
No.
I can't.
But why?
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
I know.
I was being foolish?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
That's God's way!
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
It won't happen again.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
You'd lie to protect him.
But... if you had to guess?
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
His name is John Book.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You might have killed him!
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Yes, darling.
Yes.
Yes.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
If she?
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Do you presume to criticize the....
Goodbye, folks!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
This?
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
I have?
Oh, now?
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Her -- her name is Emily.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no -- no!
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
Oh --!
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh! Oh!
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Hah!
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Because I'm still scared!
Ohh!
Oh --
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
It's pleasant down that way, too.
My, it's good to be....
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Yes -- that's true.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
To Oz!
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
The other side....
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Leave her alone!
It did?
Don't you start it, too!
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
That's right.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
This way!  Come on!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
It's a whatzis?
You don't neither --
Yeah.
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhhhh!
No, sir!
To Oz!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Yes.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.
We'll get you together!
Oh, no!
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Yes -- ....
Dont know any doctor jokes.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Bond --
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
What the hell are you talking about?
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
Who?
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Indeed.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Yes.
How long has he been with you?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
Were alright.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
Soon shell be everywhere.
Oh James.
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
What?  This is not possible.
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
Where?
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Bond!
Your father...
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Why?  What's the problem?
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
God isn't there to do it.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
What's your theory?
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I won't do that.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Old?
. . . What?
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Don't look.  Turn around.
Okay!
Yes you are.
. . . What??
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Everything's changed --
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Janey, will you marry me?
Isn't it true that you --
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Am I free to go?
What about you?
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Is that a fact?
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
How will you fix it?
The scum of the Earth.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
I was invited. What's your story?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Viktor! Stay the course.
Nice place to start, don't you think?
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
You're joking, right?
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
This is a gift. From me to you.
Had to do what I had to do.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
We all do.
What are you talking about?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Uh-huh.
Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You mutant bastards...
Gosh, I hope so.
What do you want?
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
The way what is going to be?
It does indeed, Max.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Yes, my dear, he is.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
You have the wrong house.
What was your grandfather's name?
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Yes, sir?
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Of course.
And your passport?
Very....very!
I hope you like large weddings.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Yes!... the laboratory.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
Yes, sir.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
I beg your pardon?
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Why are you talking like that?
What are you doing here?
Just putting up some tea.
What?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
I have a pretty good idea.
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
All right... elevate me!
Tonight?
You've got it, master.
What?
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Who are you talking to?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
It wasn't me.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
... I'm glad that's...
What did you find out?
Maybe...if you get here on time.
That's what we're paid for.
What???
There's only one way.
How's everything?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How nice.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Inga, wake up!
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Raise the platform, hurry!
I thought it was wonderful.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
I think I'll...carry him.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I know Frederick.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
