Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Hi.
You know Chastity?
Well, no...
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
What crap?
Wow
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Queen Harry?
Neat...
Where've you been?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
What's normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Patrick -- is that- a.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
You the new guy?
How many people were in your old school?
How many people go here?
That girl -- I --
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
What about him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You told me that part already.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What've you got for me?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
What'd you do to her?
She kissed me.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Where ya goin?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
I'm on it
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Have you seen him?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
You don't care if I die
Why'd you let him get to you?
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
I should do this.
Who?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
The Partridge Family?
So what's your excuse?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Something like that
You up for it?
I hate peas.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
Why not?
Answer the question, Patrick
My grandmother's .
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Then tell them I had a seizure.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
No, Daddy.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You're completely demented.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What just happened?
Absolutely not.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
We should have seen land.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The Judgment is ours!
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I could be gone for years.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
She said yes.
Appointment to what?
How far from here?
What does he say?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
... and also to bring medicine.
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
How can you be so certain?
Esdras is a Jew.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Six days ago, yes.
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
I let her take a shower.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Vodka tonic.
What's he looking for?
Takin' a bath.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
No, what is it?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My folks are.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
My point exactly.
So am I.
So...who's Nicky?
What do you want?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Could be Leon's.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
See you later.  Good luck.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
So what's unique?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is there a problem?
How long are you planning to stay?
This all you want?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
You got that?
Traitor!!
Did you hurt her?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Ha. Ha.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Yeah?
Yes...he's my friend.
That's what it looks like to me.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
I'll send a cop back for you.
You okay?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Clean?
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
CONTINUED
Yes?
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Yes, I thought so.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Two more.
I guess not.
What is it, Hal?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
CONTINUED
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
How many days until you come home?
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Yeah.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Hello, again.
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Last night.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Not likely, convict.
Where's the goddamn car?
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
We missed.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
It's late, they're closing...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Hey, there she is...
Thanks.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
You look awful.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
You're hopeless.
I'm all wet.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Thanks for the coffee.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Who the hell are you?
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
What're you laughing about?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...We're saved!
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
You are a monster, Zorg!
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Of course.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Leeloo... is... she's...
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
At least, the cat comes back.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Eto Akta Gamat!
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
...Hello?
Hi Ma...
Other than that... You all right?
Yeah?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
He's on vacation.
What did you say? What did you do?
I've had enough good news for today
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan!
You know women normally change five times more than men.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
Not going to open?
At least I won lunch.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
Staedert, do you read me?
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Sir!
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Hello?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
There's nothing harder.
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Machine.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Where are the women?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What are you... ?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Alright, Tom.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
We do.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Any good?
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
I don't know...
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Something like that.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
What did you do with her body?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
You're asking me why?
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
How long you been working there?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Interesting theory.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
You don't need to be here.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Uh huh, pleasure.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
My condolences.
Pittsburgh?
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
Nothing remotely like this.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Yes... ?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Neil... Neil Cole.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
What was she running from?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
It got to be too much for him.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
No...
No... no... no...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Yes... I remember Mary
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
Okay, I'll take it all.
What?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
That obvious, huh?
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Is there something we can do?
Then what else can we do?
You just feel sorry for me.
Hey, Rick!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I'll tell you later.
Feeling better now?
You don't get it, he's after me...
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
She doesn't want me around
Mommy...?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Where are we going?
I'm so sorry, honey...
Very funny.
You disappointed in me?
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
You think that's the place she's buried?
You do good work, Alice.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Who's Jacob?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Vomit?
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
What is it?
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
But if they <u>do</u>?
Reef!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
We're stuck tight!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Well?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
The frogmen?
Yes, Griff?
Something wrong?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
See what?
Well, I'll be - !
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Always has been.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
This spring.
Oh.
He's on to us!
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Guaranteed, eh?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
You might not kill it.
I'm okay.
Yeah?
They said.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
How'd you get the job?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Where'd you get the blood?
Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Yeah.
Lawford?
Open the door, will ya?
Those are the Hoyts.
I guess they're stupid.
It's stupid.
No what?
I called Mommy.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
It belongs to Pop.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
You're a policeman.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Where's the plow?
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
What do I have to do for it?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
It's just...
See. Get your boots.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
Forget it.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Hold on!
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
It don't look right.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Nothing.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Call it what you want.
Bang!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Rolfe.
Wade?
Well, it was an accident.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What about her?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Well, I never heard that one.
I'm sure he's busy.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Daddy. Daddy, please...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
How was...  ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Got it.
Uh, we got a problem here.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
But they start executing hostages in
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
About goddamn time.
How many others killed?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
How?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
What do you want with us?
No.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Four...
Jim...
Over my dead body.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
There goes your ride.
Twenty minutes?
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Sir, we stay with the President.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
How did your speech go?
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Where's my family?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
What?
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
That just doesn't make any sense.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
What is it, Mary?
Dunn.
Sir?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Elaine.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
Ted!  What are you...?
Ted, we're taking off!
What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Simon just ejected!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Maybe.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Then Elaine was right.
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
You've been hurt.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
No. I'm all alone.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Both pilots!
Can't you take a guess?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
What did he have?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
But if you'll just give me...
Ted, what are you doing here?
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
And a little ice.
But Ted, you're the only...
We have a visitor.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Oh, I can't stand it.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Randy.
You okay?
That's right.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
Yes...
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Let's talk Hubley.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
What is wrong?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Was.  Divorced.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
I'm going home.
Well, let's roll, George.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Uh, George...

No!  We must do this alone.
Harcourt is dead.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Yeah.
What kind of test?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
What?
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
This floor's freezing.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Could it be intelligent?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Is she...?
I get the picture.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
One of us?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
How do you feel?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Alive?
Save it.
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Locked.
Ellen.
Fuck you.
You're just reading me.
Looks like it stung him.
Thanks.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Fifteen meters.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
So what do I tell this guy?
How long have I been on Gateway station?
What did you say?
I don't want you for a friend.
Cross my heart.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
No, it's different, honey.
Yes.  A little girl.
Gone.
That's right.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
His Grace is very angry with you.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Where?
A Turkish brothel.
Well, what does it matter to you?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
Don't bother.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
What??
Hardly.
Sir -
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Yes!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Yes, my love?
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
You're not going to do this?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Why not?
Go back to bed.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Come back tonight.
What for?
But! I'm a married woman!
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He asked me to stay.
How much will you pay him?
Money! Money!
Oh, yes.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Behold!
Gertrude!
Just one year.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
What a charming idea. May I see?
May I try it?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, where?
What? On one hearing only?
And German?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
What do you mean, Sire?
Twenty-six.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
What is it?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
He's here.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Is she not here?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
They say you're in debt.
No, really!
Papa!
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Really? What is it he's writing?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Where?
Is he working?
Is he working?
That's right.
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Sssh!
What did he say? What did he say?
Well?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
German!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Put it down!
What is this?
What?
Yes.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Really?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Whom did they choose?
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
I'm afraid not.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
What work?
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
How long will you give me?
You mean she's not coming back?
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Are you ill?
The man. He's here.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Do you believe in it?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
I think so.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Herr Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
About what?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Is it true?
My son, no one can speak for God.
What difference does that make?
Oh my son, my poor son!
Yes?
Incredible.
Ballet? What ballet?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Well, promise then.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Can we come in?
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
The American? Yes, duck.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor?
He said 'Jack'.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Yes, sir.
He's not?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, Doctor.
I beg your pardon?
Mr. Kessler?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Call me Alex.
Call me David.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
I dream of death mostly.
I know.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
What? Oh, yes, please.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Yes, go on.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
I was dreaming again?
The bedroom.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
The next corner we can get a cab.
But...
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
No what?
Why on earth do you say that?
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Alex?
What are you going to see?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
So they said.
Yes.
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Well, I like it here.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Beware the moon?
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I have no idea.
Yeah?
No, but he was on the moors.
Shit! David, what is that?
It's moving.
Oh shit. What is that?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
What?!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
Shut up, you zombie!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
It's you, David.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
A monster. I know, I know.
Jack, are you really dead?
Hi, Jack.
No, thank you, Doctor.
What can we do to assist you?
Yes?
What here?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Do you have any hot soup?
Hot chocolate?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
I don't rightly know, sir.
Matt?
Yeah.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
I remember once when your account checked.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Yes, sir.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
What do you mean, help?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Thanks.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
That don't do us any good.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
What?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
What's this?
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Yes, sir.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Yes?
Got my letter?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Why, I don't know.
It's all right. Thanks.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
If he can do it, yes.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Did you get the case for the securities?
Absolutely.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hello, Helen!
Why?
With what?
Yes.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
What's keeping you?
Oh, Charlie again.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
He was here?
What did you find out, Mike?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I couldn't lose him.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
How'd they --
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
I swear --
He's not bad at it.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
Beg pardon?
You are a fine figure of a man.
I think I recognize you.
Not now.
What is wrong with you?
Thanks for the help.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
I got seven thousand.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
What are you saying?
Beautiful.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Still smells fishy.
Dammit!
Bob, rip up some bandages.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Cannon or Gatling?
What the --
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Strategically.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
What?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Then why can't I go in there?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Daddy, don't start with this again.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Mm-hmm.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
That would have made an impression.
I figure.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Bob's upset.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Jesse, we're outlaws.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
You've killed your fair share of men.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Yeah Jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Yep.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Me neither.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Hmm.
What?
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You are a hell of a woman.
Tennessee?
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
I figured.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
I like that.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Really?
Not at all.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
How much did they get from the safe?
This is him.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Stop it. I'm...
I know. Stop it.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Nice?
J&B. Straight.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
You and...Luis?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Do...what.
Yes, darling?
Everybody's rich.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
How did you guess?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Carnes? Wait.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Where are you going?
Patrick?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Like what?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
Oh really? That's great.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
You don't like this, I take it?
What is it?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Who's Ted Bundy?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Where are you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
What?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
How old are you?
Where did you go to school?
Bad habit.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Where did Paul hang out?
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Have you consulted a psychic?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
I mean they want to get caught.
That's not the information I've received.
Let's see...  That you were with-
Great, yes, I'd like that.
No hash browns?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I'm hungry
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Speak up. Come on.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Milo. Why would he --
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Guilt?
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
My goodness.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
What?!
Is it your software?
That's gotta kill him, right?
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
'Think I should buy some originals?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I heard what happened.
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Okay, #2.
Let's go.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
What've you got there?
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
They'd frame him.
Do we post it on the Net?
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
You mean -- break in?
Thank God.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Meet me at the other location.
It's three years old, it --
Is that how Larry feels?
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
So how'd you like the house?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
What're they building?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
You seem surprised to see me.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Hey, how are you?
Hungry.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Good luck, Austin.
Be careful.
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
When do I begin?
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
She's working on another lead right now.
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Be careful.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
I'm sure.
Why?
Let's go get him!
I hate having my picture taken.
Why?
I am not.
Oh, yes you are.
I can't. You're drunk.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Not in the Nineties.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Austin, what's your point?
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
That's not mine.
What are you saying, son?
Oh my God, he's back.
Commander, I have to log it...
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
My son?
Sea bass.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Umm, that also has already happened.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Great.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
What about his teeth?
Did you ever want to?
Well, it's kind of weird.
Really?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Flower ...
Secret ...
... love ...
... love ...
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
People, too.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
The Institute ... the funding ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
Then what's stopping you?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Choices?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Much better.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Do you?
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
As per mother's instructions.
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
Why should they think that?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Did he say who?
What on earth?
Is that written in his shoe?
For you, Mrs. Peel.
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
This must be the last straw.
You followed me.
To kill me?
And do you trust me?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
But you did suspect me.
Winning isn't everything.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
What is it?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Steed
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Possibly. Split personality ...
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
You are, and it's behind you.
What's happening?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
I've decided not to run for President.
Man, you're losing your audience.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Cole...
Five thousand dollars.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Thank you, sir.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
1002.
Cole?
No, Cole, I...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
About what?
Um... that's very relaxing.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Are you okay?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Why?
Give him the works.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
It's true.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
You want to share it?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
What the hell are you doing?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Ed... you're kinky!
You've been having strange sex...!
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Mrs.?
Rick, I'm concerned.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Who was that?
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
Hey, you guys...
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Who?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
You're late again, Rick.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Oh these moments do try me...
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
-- Knock it off!
Is he...
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
Not likely.
Been ripping off fire stations?
Sheep don't count.
Thanks.
Hey.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
Ready?
You okay?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Thanks for the insight.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Hey, what are you doing here?
You're selling dad's boat?
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Saw what?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
-- What are you doing here?
What are we going to do about this?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I'm sorry.
I don't have the slightest idea...
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Are you still here?
Where are you going?
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Read.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
What reason?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Did you pull me out?
No.
So what do you want me to do?
Brian?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
He's got piano lessons.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
You want some coffee?
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
Alderman Swayzak.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
What's to believe?
Who?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
I forgive you.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
All right. What are you gonna do?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
How's the case going?
YEAH!
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Delacroix.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
I'm not smiling.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Meaning?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
So that's what you been doing?
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
De-la-croix.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
And I'm the feet.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
How different?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
Why?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Four minutes ago.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
What are there character traits?
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
I don't know about that plantation angle.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
I didn't mean that, in life.
So what's up with you?
How did you know?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Do you know how you will use him?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
What point is that?
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
This is the group I was telling you about.
Your life will never be the same.
How so?
Why'd you do that?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
How's the food?
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Peerless, your father called.
He wants you to come and see him.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Let Myrna finish.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
Money and nothing else?
The one with da big...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
I thought you got rid of...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...I heard different, thought that was...
...too early...
...perfect...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
What else?
No, before my time.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
O'Grady.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
I don't know.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Good gracious!  What is this?
Your honor must lower his voice.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
No.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
It is my only object.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
As much as possible.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Does this assignment interest you?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
Did you buy the horse, papa?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
I beg your pardon?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Bill Styles...
You framed-him...
You killed him you fucking faggot --
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
West was one thing, but this --
Yeah, right...
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
Do what?
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Where's the cabin?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Jesus, what happened?
Roberto, what the fuck?
We just want to check your pack --
You know it's not like that --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
Full clip to the body --
But not the only victim, right?
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Is it the truth?
No. I said Dunbar.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Why?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
Home, I'm done.
What the hell are you talking about --
Yeah.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
I'm sorry, Bill.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
You and the Colonel go back.
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Why?
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
What is that?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Why do you care?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
We're fucked, I know --
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.
Hardy, what are you doing --
This isn't the time --
That's not true.
West?
Think it'll work?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Your phone number?
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
How?
Maybe we shouldn't go.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
We just want --
He said what?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Dunbar says you were.
Dunbar's telling the truth.
What happened with Nunez?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You want Kendall, don't you?
What happens to Dunbar now?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
I have to leave. Tonight.
Then do it.
Fine, you do it.
Bloom!
How long have you known my father?
No.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
In so many words, yes.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Please. Go. Just go.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Hi. How are you feeling?
I never knew.
What's your name, Giant?
You don't like it?
Okay.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
The one about the witch.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
Am I?
Really.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
You know where the chemicals are?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Dad?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
You say...
I'm sorry.
Oh.
How did you get so many?
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
'Fraid so.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Were you and my father having an affair?
You didn't become crazy.
You need to go.
You don't have to.
I need you on my side.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
So you never bought any land.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Yeah it was okay.
Yes.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
What? What are you doing?
I'm asking what you're here for.
I need to know who you are first please.
Good. 
Hold on.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
So?
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
What was that?
Tell me what he said.
No. It's not that.
How is bank?
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Syevodnya?
No I don't.
So you're just going to be vindictive
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Give me some money.
What?
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
So uh...
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
I don't want to talk about it.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes which?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
What?
It wasn't what I wanted.
Get out
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
No.
Have you had any before?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
I'm trying to quit.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't know.
You know you can come under the blanket.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Yeah. No thanks.
Okay. Goodbye.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
My name's Sophia.
You have excellent English.
How do you want to pay?
Then start taking them seriously.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You didn't have to do this.
At church?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.
What do you need?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Can I put it in your mouth?
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Still need a lift?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Let go...
Let go of my arm...
YOU SHUT UP!
Like a man.
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Why you got me chained?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
I said... STOP!
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
We drinkin' buddies now?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
What is it?
By myself?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
What I love.
This Rae... you get with her?
Now, hold up.
What'chu sayin'?
Nuh-uh.
How a girl get like that?
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Why's his britches round his knees?
You get a call from Rose?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Then what?
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Keep the change on that.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Rae...
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Are you wasted?
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
You need money again?
You got any money?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Get rid of it.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe we should do something?
What are you doing?
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Go to sleep, Charlie.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Let's go.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Connie...
Where do we start looking for this guy?
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why weren't you at the platform?
How'd you get this?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Did I say that?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Where does this Sugai live?
What...?  Why?
No.
How many men?
Joyce?
I don't know.
You all right?
Where's the wife?
What if I chant?
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
This by this...
One guy do all the damage?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
It's not your job.
We're police officers.
Because I want you to tell me.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Then go get him.
Would you like to be modified?
I want more life, fucker.
Why?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Show me something?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
His company made us.
When do you deliver your project?
What's going on down there?
Six, huh?
You got a machine on it yet?
You equipped for random questions?
You start.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Next.
You want to see my friends?
Prosit.
I like you too.
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
What's that?
Meaning?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Why didn't you go?
Too old.
Taffey Lewis?
I don't know nothing about it.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
The best.
Jeezus!
I bet I would.
Me.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
Why not?
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Do I make you nervous?
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
I told you I'd come back.
You did?
Who is this?
Where is he?
Dead.
Like?
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Ten years.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
What?
Black?
Go ahead.
No.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
Of course.
What about friends?
Beautiful.
Oh, now, that's a great one!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Are you French?
Right.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes.
And that's it?
Yes.
Perry?
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
No.
Who are these people?
Very funny, smart ass.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
What for?
I don't want to be alone.
Bites what?
The big one!
It didn't used to be that way.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Where's he gone?
In the house?
Yeah.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
No it's not!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Do I look crazy?
What have you ordered?
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Adam?!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Yes, Eve?
It was at least as good as the sky.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Yes.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
Gerade aus dann links!
These are wonderful.
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Uh-huh.
That's what everybody believes?
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
When did we get it from them?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
No.
Yeah?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
My father is a genius.
How old are you?
What?  What is it?!
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Help you?
Say what?!
I do alright.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Elbows, Son.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
This is your bedroom?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
No.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
He drank it hot?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
It shuts off automatically.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
How long will we have to stay down here?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
If I...you know...
Right here!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Calvin!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
If we still have one.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Mutants?!
Yes.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
I want him to at least see the sky!
You came back for these?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I see "elegant."
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
He go back to the hotel?
To bed?
Or have perfect table manners.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
He didn't leave with them.
I don't think so.
I don't know. I like to think so.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Adam!!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
It must be great.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
I made it go down the toilet.
You don't?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who is Don?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Frank would open you.
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I'll call you.
What?
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
He's comin' back? What for?
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
MOMMY!
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
What time are visiting hours?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
He comes over to study.
No.
No, you're right.
Hi Dad.
Uh-uh.
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
Am I bothering you?
How is Central these days?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I've gotta go in.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Are you sure?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
What's with Mike?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Goodnight.
You were late.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
What is it?
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead.
Look Jeffrey.
Stop it Mike.
Up where?
Fuck you.
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Yes sir.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Anybody see ya?
Look again for fuck sake!
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Aye.
How many?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Nine bodies.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
What?
My, my...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
So what are you thinkin' here?
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
The fat man.
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
Who were the victims?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Right now.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Hello?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
This is some crazy shit, man!
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
You believe?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
You know them personally?
Yes.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Don't do this my son.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
Why?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
Is it back in?
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Dignan, calm down.
What's wrong with him?
What do you think?
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Why not?
Well, then cut it in half.
Look at the treads on those.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
I'll just say it.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
She's from Cuba.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Maybe he just went to the store.
He went back for his brother.
This morning.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I don't think we can do that.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Sixteen dollars.
I know.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
She needed it.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
I want you to look at this.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Eleven fifteen.
Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.
Yeah. As a girl.
Uh-huh?
Any activity?
Who tripped the alarm?
I don't know.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Why?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
Where?
So how is it in there? 
What?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
You mean a safecracker?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Who?
Hector woudn't do anything.
There's a million places to hide around here.
I hope not.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
How long are they going to hold him?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You think I'm improving?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Was Future Man adopted?
Give him a second.
What are you doing?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Were you born in Mexico?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
That's your friend Anthony?
What's he doing here?
Wait. Did he see us?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I don't know about that.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
You're paranoid, Bob.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
That's your domain.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
You really think he'll remember you?
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
What the fuck possessed you?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
I don't know.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Watch me.
Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
I never agreed to that.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Wait a second --
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
You keeping out of trouble?
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
He said what?
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Is he good?
Where did he go?
Why did he go that way? 
What's the story?
We're closed, sir.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
You Hoto?
It's locked.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Never heard of it.
I want to know about Treadstone.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Excuse me.
What?
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
No good options left?
No. You lost your way.
What do you have, Danny?
Jesus...
Lots of people...
Show me again...
I emptied it.
So why didn't you kill me then?
Who sent you to Greece?
Pamela Landy?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it hasn't been two years --
I worry when you get like this.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
So...
Where --
What?
Switch! You drive!
-- it's just him? --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
What if it's not who you think it is?
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I love you, too.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Say it.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
My first job.
That's a lie!
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
What's that?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
What kind of problems?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
So he fooled you.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
We cannot defeat this --
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Good day to you, M'Lords.
Wallace's followers.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
I don't want to be a martyr.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
You'll move
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You scare me.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
Tonight then.
How do you know this?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
They've tricked us.
Anything.
Why? What for?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
I... I blacked out.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
How long will I be in here?
There must be a way to fix this.
Fix?
Just. Like. Jason.
Straight up.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Weirder than this?
What did you see? What did it look like?
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
But I... I need those books.
I thought you were a December baby.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Are you stupid or what?
What?
Huh?
Ouch.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Where... where are my clothes?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
I get it. You can drop it now.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Yeah?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Oh? There's proof now?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Is something the matter?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
What time is it?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
And you are...?
So what's the point?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Are you sure you even packed it?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
I should have known.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Does he know that?
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Here you are.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
You haven't heard my offer.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Practically no one.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Rick?
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
What are they?
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Why there is no other man in my life?
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
That's too far ahead to plan.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Has it got a wow finish?
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
You can believe that if you want to.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
How did you get in?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
No, not yet.
But why my name, Richard?
But what about us?
Where is Rick?
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
I must find out what Berger knows.
Be careful.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
Well then, perhaps you also ---
How do you do?
Good morning.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Well, this might come in handy.
Had a close one, eh?
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Yes. What is it you want?
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
What else, my dear Major?
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Victor Laszlo.
His escape.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Why two?
He'll take one.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, it's my party.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
What friend?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
You're late.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
Hello?
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
I like it fine here.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Yeah?
No.
You ever going to bed?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Shut up and go home, will you?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
No, I don't.
It's bad.
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
Thirsty.
Take it, damn it.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
They're harder to do than they look.
Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?
I've got lots of time.
How was Russia?
Chuck.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Merry Christmas eve.
Hey, look at you.
You know, for when you travel.
Get back?  From where?
I thought you might have.
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
Is that Jango?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?
Come on.  Try.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Which I didn't have.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
You're Chuck Noland.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Don't you even think about it.
The place is falling apart.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Can you find her?
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
But I might not have.
And never take.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
Digital laser readers.
Take your time.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
Thanks.  For everything.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
These *credentials* are against the law!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
I'm *not* a doctor!
Why not?
What'd she die of?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
Burma!
Oh...
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
A movie *outside*?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
But you looked as if you liked it.
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
At least you were never lonely.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
You don't understand! It's her father...
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
I know, I'm sorry.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I love you, Wally.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
What's a nanny do?
Did you grow up around here?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh... it's the end of October.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Really! Is it serious?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
First pregnancy?
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
It looks like scurvy.
In other words, scurvy.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
We heard that one already, Homer.
So what?
Give men that. I know how to do it.
That's it.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Do you know him?
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
The standard ten.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Know who I am, Jake?
Gee... What makes you say that?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Like what?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Who's that?
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
I told you, use less powder.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
I think two million.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
What about... The money?
Says who?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
You need to get a haircut.
I don't trust anyone.
He's gone.
Lighten up.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
How do you deal with --
He was looking out for you.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
Sorry. I didn't know...
You got my cell. Leave a message.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Yeah.
It's bad luck.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Meet me at my place later.
Why?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Him.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
What do we do? We change the scam?
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
You going to have the time?
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Stand up.
Aces, Suits.
Pretty much.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
It's not history.
So what do you want?
Ten percent.
Just a tip.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Speak.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Who?
What do you want?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
To who?
You trust this Moonan guy?
High five.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
Ouch.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
All right. As what?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I couldn't resist them.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
You're my prisoner.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
What's the time?
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
You will?
What?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
How did you know I was here?
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Here...use a spoon.
Leave me alone, Marion.
Why did you take the money?
What?
I want to buy a car.
Found a job?
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Your father?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
I can't do it, Jani.
Is it yes?
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
I'm Lucy.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Nice car.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
What are you, a cop?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
And the girls?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
What happened to Bella?
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
Where did you go to school?
I was at Beadles.
We check every four days.
We do. 
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't think so.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
How?
Fine.
That hair will have to go.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
How do you feel, Jack?
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Yeah.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
What's he doin'?
It didn't go off.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
This is fun.
And you can only do it once, right?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Fred.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
TALBY!
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
What happened, Doolittle?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Sorry.
Sir?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Men... men... what happened, men?
No?
How I make my living, what's your point?
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
What're you talkin' about?
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Can I say something in my defense?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Out there.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Same old story.  Not interested.
You're light a deuce.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
What a creep.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Can you help me get her back?
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Mommy, where are you?
Girl's gotta make a living.
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
Lemme get my coat.
Too early to tell.
Lauren's not my wife.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
You got a lotta nerve.
How do I know you didn't?
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
The other one like you...
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
Your help.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
I'm sorry.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
I don't know what to say.
We're quoting Mom again.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Look, I don't know what you want--
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
Then what?
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
A little what?
A long time.
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
I actually know how this works.
And she bought that?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Playing hooky again?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Max--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Exactly.
Lydia.
I'm a toy to her.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
She tells you how I've been--
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
What the hell is that?
Gin.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
One more time in English.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Sunday, but...
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Uh... dudes?
I think we should try sneaking in.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
It was stolen!
I got...
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
But we took the keys?
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Yeah.
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
What was his name?
So... that's it?
Like a DeLorean.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
When can I squeeze one out?
Dea ex machina...
Where did you come from?
You have to do something for me first.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
How much longer is this gonna last?
We went to a hotel.
Hey...
So... you just moved here?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Where are we going?
What happened to your neck?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Are you okay?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
What's wrong with you?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
My mom is gone.
What?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
People aren't that simple.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Who is Frank?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
How so?
I asked you about school.
How many times have you seen Frank?
Can anyone else see him?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
If God exists?
I think now that he might...
How is that possible?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Yeah.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I was just being honest.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Our son just called me a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
He was a year ahead of us?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
Is Mom okay?
You're what?!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Loretta, never have kids.
Really?
Okay.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Airport Ho-Jo!
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Huh?
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Amber...
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Bye mom.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
And the bite marks on my ears?
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
I know.
Okay... well, bye.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
Annette, just use your hand.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Okay?
That bitch from...
The bitch.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
Becky was my only shot at state!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Nothin' too showy!
Oh! What is it?
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Harold!
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
My dear President...  read it back...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My President"...
"My"...
"My dear"...
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Send for my car...
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
But you're my father -
Father...
What's the matter with you?
Have you got a license?
Half watch dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
I don't want him.
That was for you.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Did you shoot the rapids?
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
She did.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
How'm I doing, boss?
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
I don't remember.
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Oh, Rufus!
Now -- er --
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Uncle, you can't do this!
One or two?
They have noble faces.
You won't be long?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Yes.
That I am very little different from him.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
What is it?
What are you going to do?
This man belongs in hospital.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Never mind that, I want my man!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Good! How is the patient?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Don't we?
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
How are you feeling today?
Are you comfortable here?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Tell me about it, please!
Romance!
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Yes.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
Mmmerrick.
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Righteousness...
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
You look splendid, John.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
That's a canopy, John.
How is your tea, John?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
The Children. Where are your children
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Good morning, John.
Yes, John?
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
No, John, not one that I can see.
I've heard.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
No, he's very upset about something.
Watery headed bunch.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Very smart indeed.
A dressing bag?
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
What's the matter?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
No!
Erik. You don't understand.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
How do we know this is the way?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
What do you see, Erik?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
But you don't want to hear it.
We're just not a very musical nation...
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Yes... oh, yes...
But it IS! Look!
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Shut up.
You don't love ME.
What -- rape?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Louder.
You told them I raped you -- why?
What?
You talking piffle, son?
Who have you been talking to?
She got me thinking...
What did he say?
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
You mean we'd be dead?
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
That's better.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
I think we should go...
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Well, what else do we do?
What's all the panic about?
He hasn't.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Get away, Snorri.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
That's right.
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Help!
I know, Dad.
You went berserk...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
Easy, Dad!
Shut up.
Yes, Mother.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
You weren't supposed to see that.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I remember.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
How are you today?
You rat.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
It's okay, really.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Really? Because --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I can't remember.
I don't really know how --
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
So you like bookstores, huh?
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
What?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
What do you want to hear?
You just say. I'm not really --
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I think so.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I want to know you.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Oh?
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
There's this guy!
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
This is our first "date" date.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
I told her today I need to end it.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think, before.
Cool.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I knew.
What if you stay this time?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
When?
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Doesn't sound like me.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Oddly enough, I do.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
It's them.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
How was it?
So you don't mind?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
So you think the dissertation will get published?
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Yeah. Cool.
I know. Anyway --
You found us okay?
We haven't checked.
Yeah.
Hey.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.
How did I look?
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Okay, we're back in.
Is that Nietzsche?
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
This one's history. Moving on...
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Clockworks.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I'm staying with the Countess.
Tell me about it.
About...
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
How does she like what in bed?
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
What guy?
Going north?
Hitchhiking?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
From what?
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
The containment, Second Containment...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
How is he?
What is it?
Hear what?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
90 over 50 and falling... .
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
What does?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
I can see the hatch.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
I found one.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
That is not acceptable --
No one?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
It's complicated...
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
It's 2041...
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You know.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
But...
Captain Miller, you copy?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Captain, we got a problem.
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
No, no, we just got her back together...
Everybody okay?
It tastes bad.
How much oh-two do we have?
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
Maybe one of the original crew?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Miller, come in...
What's going on in there, Starck?
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Blow it up?
He served on the Goliath.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Can you see a body?
He's engaged the override.
You got any coffee?
Where is she?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
If they are, they're screening their calls.
What happened to his eyes?
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Do they have pressure?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
He's made a few changes.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Hey! That's a prototype!
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
You're hot!
Stay right. Left is trouble.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
But all these people...
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You two need a time-out.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Leonard, how's the feed?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Front page?
Yes, thanks.
You're happy for me and Victor.
Which was?
That's what we're here to find out.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
You were?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Why didn't you say something?
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Come on, Ben, come on...
What are you doing here?
It's just business.
I understand the business reasons.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Please don't make this personal --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
You want to work at Carl's?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Hi, Brad.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool too.
Get a ride with somebody.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Well...
Pick a suit.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right... where did you see her?
Did you get her number?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Really?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Damone, are you there?
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
You're losing it, Damone.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
That little prick.
That little prick.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Not coming? What happened?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
But what are you going to do?
Yes.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
What can I get for you tonight.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Where's your brother?
No. That's okay.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Where's Mike today?
I made a fool of myself.
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Killed?
What happened? What did they do to her?
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Oh, my God!...
This is my granddaughter...
Jesus! Did I say that?
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
What are you talking about?
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
How about a check?
I want that fucking radio!
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
You degenerate pig!
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Right!
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
The airport is over there!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
Could I have that, please?
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Stop!
I will not die because of him!
We should go! We should go right now!
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Who the hell would you call?
Wha?
You got something better?
What!? I'm not going down there again!
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Scared?
Ohhh.
Come on!
Why do you take shit from him?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
We're going to get help.
We gotta be close.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
You wanna see, baby?
Sure.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Huh?
Huh?
Keys.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I'll go with ya.
Got 'cha!
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Let's go.
Let's wait it out.
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Her name is Charlie.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Frances?  Oh no.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
My clothes?
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Hello, Harold.
Where's Clifford?
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
What does Clifford say?
Get your clothes on, lady --
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
...Yes.
Dick, we need some time apart --
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
...I see.
We'll get you home, Frances.
What do I do, Dad?
I know that, Dad, but --
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
See you next weekend?
Oh, Kurt!
You can always come see it in London.
Why?
Aren't you ever going back?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Enh.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
...So you think I should go.
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Jesus.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Serious, huh?
You're telling me.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
The hell you will, Harry York.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Take a walk, pal.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Huh?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
There's just one more thing.
What's that?
Yeah. I don't know.
How did I look?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Pretty morning.
Where you goin'?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Fine!
Who're you?
I'm not!
The speech? Real good.
Mama...
Yes, Ma.
It's okay.
Why are these all opened?
What?
What's wrong?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
At one. Promise?
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Mama...?
Don't I know you?
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
You're kidding.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
You speak.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Materials. Nothing more.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
I don't know.
Soon?
She's beautiful.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Nothing. Still nothing.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
So have I
Are you all right?
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
God took her from us.
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
And you?
I wish to be your wife.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
I've no choice
I thought I'd never see you again!
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
It is
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
I was just clearing my throat.
Can you think of a better reason?
You're making a scene!
You can't. Death is God's will!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
No. He had more important work.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Quite a place.
For what?
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
I have always loved him.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I heard.
You know of it?
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Do you share my madness?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
What'd you see?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
You can only do what you can do.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Claudette...
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
That was the telephone.
How about our last jay?
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Whassamatta?
It's beautiful...
Cowboy.
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
How much do I owe you?
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Another coincidence.
What was that?
You said it was just you and your son.
Twenty-eight.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Why did they block the door again?
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Yes.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Real McCoy.
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
You won't let him touch her?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
I don't have the slightest idea.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
He backed down.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Now, is your shit together?
You too, preacher?
In the Winnebago.
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
What's this stuff?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Where are you taking us?
What?
Do what?
Not many.
-- you got your microwave --
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Yeah?
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Where's the woman?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Richard!
This ain't the time, Richard.
Keep your voice down.
I don't know, you just passed out.
I did?
We are?
They broke when you fell.
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
My shit is together.
Yeah.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
How are you?
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
Thank you, ensign.
Who's "we"?
But are there... I mean, how many...
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Pardon?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
Straight up?
Entering my scan now...
Shit.  Think we're had.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
Yes?
"Coronado."
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, question, ma'am.
Yes, dear.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Should probably ask him that.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
I'm sure it is.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
No, ma'am.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Come on, Montgomery...
O'Neil?
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
She's haze grey and underway...
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
This has nothing to do with you.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Which is guy-speak for...
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
I don't know, I don't care.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
They're more afraid of you.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
That's a good story.
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
'Cool?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
I think you're the liar.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Got it.
O'Neil...
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
I just wonder how that happened.
This ain't workin' right!
You knew about us?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Women.
I don't know.  Seems...
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Animal, I can't.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
I'll take them all.
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
How do you know?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Are you okay?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
So have dinner with me tonight.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
We? I don't think so.
Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Have them sealed off.
You're fast.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
What sample?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
We know.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Don't speak, Quellek.
Come on, old friend...
I won't and nothing you say-
God, what an ass.
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
What?  What?
Alex you can't -just leave.
"Go into the cloud! ...
He always has to make the big entrance.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Yes but, we were wondering-
... Yes?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's  your name, son?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Yes Commander?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Okay, now. But-
No, wait, are you-
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
U.... What do you think?
... What does that mean?
A hologram...
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
Where are the miners?
Oh, they're so cute.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
They're still behind us...
Yeah, what is it?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
We're alive!
~e're alive!
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
There's nobody here. Jason...
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
Gwen...
Because it was on the show!
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
You gotta admit, they do love him.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Closer?  I can try.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
We.. We lie.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
Theramin.
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Then how did he find out about the device?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
NO NO NO.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Arnold!
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Misunderstood what!?
What?  What are you talking about?
Yes, general?
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
We've got powder but no ball!
How old are you, Captain?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
What's your advice, Alexander?
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Partially...
Unofficially, General Greene.
Any word from Canada?
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
A grand scheme?
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
They help me understand why we fight.
I... they look both the same.
No, please; an advance on your salary.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
I only meant...
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
I rode here, on my horse.
Like flowers after the snow melts.
What is it, Marquis?
General Lee, sir!
Surely you knew this was coming.
My God, what?
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
That's right...
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
But, you do come from a military family?
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
George, you know I only love you, but...
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Where... do those men come from, George?
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
All people have rights!
I see...
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
So... how many movies you been in?
Where is my nephew?
You gave him the money?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
What about her?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
In just a second. Two...
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Where's Karen?
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
You positive about that?
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
C-18.
Ray Barboni?
Who is this?
Okay. So who are you?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
Get in line, bro.
I'm in the movie business.
Your wife a Lakers fan?
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
I'm looking at you.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
Part of it, yeah.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
What does that mean?
Once.
Really? You ever been arrested?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
So what's the problem?
He drown?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
He died.
Yeah, he told me.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. That was a good party.
We talk different?
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Wait. How about this?
How about this?
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
That's right. Three percent.
Man, can you scream.
"Cotton".
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
You been here the whole time?
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Then you've read it?
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Are you going down?
Were you scared up there?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
I told you not to -
Whatta you doing out there?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Hello, Doris.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
'We?'
What money?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Oh, for Christ's sake -
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Fucker!
Damn mind of it's own.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
The turbine blew.
Where from?
One more?
What is your first name?
Maureen.
What're you crazy?
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
If you get it back in one piece.
How long to fix?
Turbine rotor's shot.
Or somebody stopped them.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Bodies're too fresh.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
How do you mean?
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Morning everybody.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
What?
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Candy?
Go on.
What'd you find up there?
She was sailing up north, right?
Nope.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
What guy?
Are you sure?
You sure it wasn't me?
You just shoot at something?
The ah... the radio's out.
February first.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Hey.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
Epps? You there?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
Yeah.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
You're up late.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Pretty low all around.
Ho-ly shit.
What happened?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
Say what?
Oh, man.
Shut up.
It's a Noaa buoy.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
What's this?
No, no. You got leak.
You're kidding, right?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Guess.
Someone from the past.
Yup.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Yeah, I heard about that.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
Hmm.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
No.
Hi Josh.
Hi... what's up?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
That's just the way I am!
Yeah, well --
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Oh, hi...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Hi, Al!
I might actually get the pasta special.
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
Does Oomie really like this show?
There's my dad with Joanie.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Which loser?
Look, maybe that's him!
SHUT UP!
What's he doing now?
He's insane!
Gross!
That was truly pathetic.
Oh yeah...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Just promise you'll do it.
Where are we going?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Ew ... when did you get that?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
Anthony's II!
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Don't worry.
Go ahead...
No, really...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
What? When did you see Josh?!
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
I said "great"...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
That's all you're bringing?
Hi.
What about me? Am I not even here?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Who does?
That's not even --
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Do you have any old Indian records?
A dollar seventy-five.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
I'm totally serious!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Well are --
Yeah, sure... very funny....
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
Yes, that would certainly do...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
You work at Cook's Chicken?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Oh yeah?
Uh... hello?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
...I better not...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
Well when can we do something?
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Just someone so young...
No, of course not.
In what way do you mean?
What are you doing here?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
What?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I-I-I...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Please Josh?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I agree.
Yeah.
I am.
Talk to us about it...
What do we have here, Margaret?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Right, exactly!
She's not at home?
No... they said she was here...
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
Yes?
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
No hints, Samuel.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
You've never built in Africa.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
I do need to see Starling.
Understand, I had help-
Then why do you stay?
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Anything special about them?
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
Second death? Where?-
What a good week.
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Have you got it?
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Have you ever failed?
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
Why do the workers look unhappy?
I am also liaison between these two.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Oh yes, I think so. 
Thank you, Samuel.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
What are you working on, Egon?
Occasionally
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
I won't.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Okay, that's no problem.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I'm not even good for me.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Sorry!
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Who are you going to call?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I know.
Then why have you come?
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
You've got to do something!
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
What now, Brainiac?
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who?  Who?  Who?
What's that?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
Like a goat on garbage.
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
My Fault!
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Does it have any favorites?
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Tell him about the toaster.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
... I thought it was the drug store.
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Like a used car salesman.
What?
Uh-huh.
Well, let's check it out.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
Great rehearsal.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
All right.  Since you put it that way.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Print is dead.
I want you to have this. 
What is it?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Has this ever happened before?
Great!  How's it going?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Circle?
Yes.  I don't like this.
Two wavy lines?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
What?
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Gozer.
Life is just a state of mind.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Set entry grid.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
What do you mean by "seen?"
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
So do I.
Where are you, Pete?
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
What?  What popped in there?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Do you believe in God?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Judgement Day ...
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
You're coming back?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
What is that... wailing?
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
That's difficult to say, general.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
They won't break this one.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Take grain away from the army?
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Would that Marcus had lived.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
Serious stuff...
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
My troops don't make policy.
You brought the army into Rome.
He's very realistic.
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
No -- why should I?
Will you take me home now?
I want to go home.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
Is anything wrong?
Yes.
You do?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
What?
Please let me go.
Don't you have it on?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
What are you going to do now?
What?
We just can.
I'll think about it.
No, Benjamin.
Oh no. He said that.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
What?
The Singleman party, sir?
Yes sir?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
No. 
What for?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
But it's light in there now.
Why not?
Drink?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
What?
Sit down, Benjamin.
What?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Aren't you?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
What is wrong with me?
Benjamin?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Do you understand what I said?
Yes, I do.
May I sit down?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
The number.
Thank you.
Well.
Yes?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
You what?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
You can admit that, can't you?
Who said it was my first time?
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Are you tired of it?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
No.
Yes I do.
How do you get out of the house?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
What?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
And you were a student also.
How do you think.
I'm curious.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Then let's hear them.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Did I say that?
What are you doing?
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But it's not.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Now it seems to me --
I don't believe you.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
What have you done to her?
I'll find her.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
No -- actually I'm not --
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
When I go off?
Nothing else.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
When did you two talk this over?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
I know.
Yes, sir.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Hello.
Now look -- please --
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Can you see me now?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Turn 'em up.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
I want to speak --
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Need any help?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Free --
Where downstairs?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
I'd given you up.
Chasing what?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
For tonight. 
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I want to be alone --
What?
And?
There.
I'll not denounce you.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Do you understand?
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Very early in the morning.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
On the train?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
You've lost everything?
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
For me?
No -- letters to two-eighty.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Good heavens. What for?
I don't know.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
No, Doctor.
This gentleman can have my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Everything?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Yes.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Yes --
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Later?
What...! --
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Movies?
You...
What?
That's from skiing.
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Not too quickly.
Hello!
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
No -- now.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Well?
Of course -- of course. 
Oh, yes.
Why not?
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
All right.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
How clear is Manchester?
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Madam has slept well?
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Why not?
What -- what is it? Last night...
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Again?
I don't know you.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
If you will wait one moment, sir.
How is the house?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
What's the matter with you?
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Pretty as a picture.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
My son --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
No.
Permanent damage.
You want a drink?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
I certainly hope not.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
I know.
But what's wrong?
All right.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Whadaya say?
Roy Dillon.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
Well, uh... No.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Oh, come on, Roy.
So what's your story today?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
At what?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I know you do, so that's why --
You want a drink?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
Never.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
You're getting off the grift?
I don't see why not.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
There's nothing more to talk about.
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Let me see how you did that one.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Every day in every way.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
Big spender.
No.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
I'm a salesman.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Yeah?
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
What?
You watch that mouth.
Yes?
I realize this is a shock.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Carter.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Care to join me?
Yes.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Forget it.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
You're twisted.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Just get on the bus.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
Why not?
I came to see you.
Then I'll get caught.
You really think Eddie killed her?
You look kind of cold.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
The serial killer?
Yeah.
What is it?
I'll pop a Benadryl.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Shit, Linda!
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Thanks!
Let the party begin.
Is Tim there?
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Promise?
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
What now?!
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
It was you.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Miss me, baby?
Home, sweet home.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
I suppose.
At least!
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
This room is full of ghosts.
You know what gets me?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
So long, Colonel.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
And how were things?
Could have happened to anybody.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
In what way, pray tell?
Everybody thinks that.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
Insurance!
You're making a joke.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
I wouldn't drop my gun.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
You were about to ask a question?
Are you--do you--
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He worships Father.
She met him at college.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Mhravitch.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Mhravitch.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
You're supposed to get hurt!
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Dad?
Who was it?
Nothing.
No.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Dad--
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Sir?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
Daughter--I love you very much.
Like hugging a lamp post.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
No.
What then?
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
What are you going to do?
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
Unless she has nerve.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
Rifle?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
You're begging him to kill you?
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
No you don't.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
It's always locked.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
He's dead, you know.
Oh dear.
We'll miss you so.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
None.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're a son of a bitch.
Hands and knees, you say?
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I see.
You're too modest.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
What is this thing that kills me?
No.
New lives begin!
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Dead!
Alice is dead?
For what?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
What happened?
What will you do, Colonel?
I'm only ten years old.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Yes.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Ja?
I don't care what she wears.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Kid--kid--
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What's this?
Don't touch me.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
A what kind of doctor?
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
That's an interesting piece of news.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
How did she lose her feet?
Is Norbert still here?
Then get him.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.
Doing what?
That's something I suppose.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Is he all right?
You figure!
A what?
What was it?
Possibly.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
I wish Paul luck.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
It's a jungle out there.
You know each other?
Tell her to have a nice trip.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Is that a fact?
Not true.
Or get eaten alive.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
He died of a massive rupture.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
No.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
No.
Yeah.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Just one.
We offer...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yeah.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Yeah.
Joanne?
Nah.
Where is she?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
I thought you were going to bed?
No.
Huh?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
How important do you think sex is?
What's T-J?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Fuck.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
More or less.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
What happened?
Where is he?
But then you'll forget about me.
Well, what do they know?
Andy.
You are.
Hello?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
No.
Who made it?
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I'm only human, you know.
What are you doing here?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Does she know anything about this?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
How did you find me?
What?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where!
Yeah.
No.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Okay.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
It's a short film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
That's all right.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
You ever play Chicken?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Huh?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
How long have you been driving?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Took it?
None of that, lady.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
What do you see?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Yes.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
My door is always open.
Harold?
Eh, fine.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
What is it?
But what?
Why not?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Look, the ice is melting.
Well, I really don't drink...
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Okay?
I think he's following us.
He's stopped.
I like Glaucus.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
It's all right.  It's organic.
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
No. I'd feel stupid.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
But they have.
Don't you advance on me.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Look at the stars.
I don't know. Perhaps.
- end where I began.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
It's all right. It's organic.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Farewell?
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
I have a sore throat.
Mother.
To whom?
I don't care what people say.
Would you like a cigarette?
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
A rough estimate.
What about the draft?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
No.
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
No.  I'd have liked to.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Oh sure.
How about to slit his throat?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Yes.
Well, I didn't.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Julia.
Frank.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Yes!
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
I knew you'd come back.
I... I had a visitor.
What?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
WHY?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I'm scared.
Well... G'bye.
Then why are you here?
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Steve...
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Nah -- he's taken care of.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
What is it?
Here. You'll need one of these.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
What the hell was that? An ape?
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Son. About Rasputin --
How does he know so much about me?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Got tired of me?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
We're on the move.
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Those things never work. Never.
-- should go back. Now!
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Yup.
You're kidding --
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Myers?
You want me to hold him down?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Not from you.
Well good n-
Out? Out out?
I like that...
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Doesn't sounds like him.
Strong.
I know.
What -- ?
Hello, I'm --
Yes, I --
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Christ!
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
The box... you opened it. We came.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Let me alone, will you?
Nobody escapes us.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
We've got such sights to show you --
I have to speak to my father.
It's important.
No.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
I'm brother Frank.
Well can I come in or not?
Julia.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
...somebody...
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Not know.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
I don't.
Sure.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
I saw everything.
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
Larry!
Is it deep?
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
It's probably going to need stitches.
You're done worse.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
I'm here.
Can I get you anything?
What's wrong with you?
I don't know where to begin...
What?
Is this your place ?
First time for everything.
Oh Christ.
You're awake. Good girl.
Kirsty?
Where are you?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
Well I want you to see the house.
Great.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
O.K.
Call me tomorrow.
Big house.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Yeah.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
I'm here.
If there's a train.
What do we do if there isn't?
She's so damn... English.
Meaning what?
It's not what I heard.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What did I say?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
Not the point.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
Yeah.
What?
What do you mean, "what?"
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Like fuck you are.
We're getting that anyway.
Why not?
I have all of the others.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Oh.  Okay.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Hey Charlie.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
'Morning, Dick.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Rob.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
You look upset.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
Yeah.  Great.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
So, how are you?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I don't have your number.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
You know I'm a good person.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Are you alright?
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Pig died.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't want to go back.
When are you going back?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Hi.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
What it was like.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
Harder.
Where?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Hey.  It's Liz.
How're you holding up?
It's true!
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Enough, Liz.
You share a place with T-Bone?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
You haven't even seen it!
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Everything all right?
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Well call her mother.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
But you must have --
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
I think you have more.
Well we don't.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
He'd want to know about all this.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
It's my birthday.
He was unsual.
Why?
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-Okay okay.
Yes.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Jesus Christ.
Why not?
No.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
You are being foolish.
No one knows you're here?
When you finish, what then?
They do it each year.
You're using your son's name.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Not the same.
There are differences.
Don't.
Now there's a new topic.
A murder.
You and I should talk first.
Spare me the details.
What are you getting at, Moran?
It'll never stick.
I don't believe him.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
-Et lux perpetua-
Stop.
You're not from these parts.
I did at that.
Aye.
I was driven out.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
It is less.
I don't know why.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
Aye.
But we cannot be killed.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
I am not ready for this.
Of course.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
Who am I deceiving?
No doubt.
Finish your prayers?
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
We need more time.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
We have no understanding.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Stay out of it.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Figure she's with him?
Yeah.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Are you sure?
He knows I'm here.  How?
_Answer_ me.
How did you find me?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
I knew his great-grandfather.
You're insane.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Of sorts.
It's all we have.
Yes laddie, I have her.
No.
It doesn't.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
What are you getting at?
Do you know what this is?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
You're a kind man to be sure.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
The resemblance is amazing.
Morning Mr. North
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
What's the idea of locking this?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Hello, Bensinger.
No. Roy. Roy V.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'll keep you in mind.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
All right, dear.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
The five hundred? Sure.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Hildy! Where's mother?
Did you give her the money?
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
No -- she didn't.
Mother? But your mother --
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
Save that for the Tribune.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
Just what I said. That's what I --
What's the matter?
Sweeney.
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Keep away --
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Where'd you meet this man?
What's his line?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
You're not afraid, are you?
Then what does he want with you?
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Never mind that. What's the story?
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
She jumped out of the window.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I get it!
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
How much do you want on it?
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Where's Bruce?
What did you do with her?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Hello -- hello...
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
When did you deliver this first?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Well -- what is it?
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Where'd you wire him?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
What!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Who do you want?
I'm busy, Duffy.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
There's money in it, Cooley.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Hey!
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
She says she's gonna write fiction.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Hold the phone!
I'll call.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
What?
What went off?
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Just one second --
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Pure politics!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
We'll fix that, too. 
What?
Shoot to kill, I said.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
A sight for sore eyes!
That's a lie!!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Now, Hildy --
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
What did you do with her?
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Look out, you --
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Hiding him where?
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Quiet, Mollie!
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Hey --
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Get the Governor on the phone!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
A very fine-looking women.
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Get the cops, somebody.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Baldwin -- his name is.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
What's he want?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Pauline's mum got killed.
What's that?
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
You said that last year, Dad.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What about it?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
So you're going to be a grandfather.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
We don't know anything about it
It looks....foreign.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
You know it? It must be an old one.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
Is it peace in out time?
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
It was the best time of his life.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Cone.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
What about R.J.?
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Where's that?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
A dead one.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
You know... a couple of queers.
Now, what makes you think that?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
I don't drive cross country.
I don't.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
How much further?
It's a hitchhiker.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
What!
Come on, get with the facts.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
That's nice.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Huh?
Ugh, what's that smell?
So.
Why?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
What are you laughing at?
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Rise and shine.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Open up the trunk.
Oh, right.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
I suggest you kids leave now.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Grampa... watch the language.
Who's your Daddy!
Fit the profile?
Turn up this road.
That's it?
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Hello, my little boy.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Of course not.
Is everything fine?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Fine.
What is it?
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
Well?
No. You look so beautiful.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Lila?
No.
My apologies, madam.
He's dead.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Ouch. Yeah?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Shut up and tell me.
Really?
Yeah?
One night stand?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Nathan told my brother.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Oh, Rosie.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
What's the larger experiment?
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
I'm sorry?
Boy, this is good!
You really enjoy my company?
I like you, too, Nathan.
Fifteen.
Yes, darling.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
What?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
He looks perfectly fine.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
What?
It's perfect!
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm just preoccupied.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Really?
That's great.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
How's work?
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
How come?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Oook. Oook.
Oh boy!
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Puff, put the gun down.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Yes?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
That's right, Miss Packard.
I want to talk to you.
Do we need words?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
How?
All I want's the money.
How much?
Do you really think you can beat him?
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Okay?
Make it twenty.
Thought you only drank milk.
I lost twenty bucks.
Poker's not your game.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Where do I sign?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Hey, Findley's here.
Where?
How do we stand?
'Bout even.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Well, here it's half.
Aaaahhhh!
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
The expensive kind.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Whaddya mean?
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Quit. He's too good.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
What for? To play Fats again?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Just like that?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Couple of bucks.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
How long have you been waiting?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
You don't look like a college girl.
No.
Fifth of scotch?
Why did you do that?
At school. It's Thursday.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
No, why should I? It's yours.
Do you want me to go?
What's this supposed to mean?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
A loser?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
I love you.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Well, what's so funny?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
For how long?
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Why?
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Go on back to the hotel.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
That's what the game's all about.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
What choice did I have -- ?!
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
I only protect myself -- !
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
What's inside?
Who?
Shhh... don't talk.
You built things.
Bathroom?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I'll take you to school.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
May I ask why?
About what?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
No.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
No.
Who are you calling?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
Don't go in.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
Your father asked you a question.
I have school.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Oh?
Why, yes.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Just my luck, no ice.
You still believe in him.
Better be. You left me for him.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Can you believe this?
A countdown to what?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
Pops!
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
That's impossible...
A meteor?
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
Sorry for what?
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
I don't need it.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
You sure?
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Mr. President?
Can they be killed?
Air... water... your "sun."
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Peace? No peace.
What do you want us to do?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
All my life!
Dad?
Ah, Venice...
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Tapestries?
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Are you sure?
Knock it off. You're not mad.
What are you going to do?
This one. I think he's in here.
Dad!
Don't call me that, please.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Well, what was left of him.
Rats?
I came here to save you.
No! Don't Shoot!
Umh?
And the chair.
What?
Head for the fireplace!
Stop!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
Dad, how can you?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
This is intolerable!
Now, who are all these people?
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
What did you find, Dad?
I like Indiana.
Uh-huh.
Who are you?
That was seven hundred years ago.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
I don't need camels.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My name is Kazim.
Interested in local curios?
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
That was a misunderstanding.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Dr. Jones.
You have insulted my son.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Why they glow like that?
Let up on the brake!
That's far enough!
No, the stones are mine!
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Long ago -- before my father's father.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
And then they took their children.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
PET IT??!!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
It's okay. You're all right now.
What?
I can't!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
It wasn't him.
Al.
You're in my head...
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Right.
Quit screwing around, this is important.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
No.
I know...it sounds insane.
What are you doing?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Hear voices don't I.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.
You'll be alive.
What's that?
What'd he look like?
Now what?
I want out.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
What do you mean we.
Take a left and your next right.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
What about money?
What about it?
I'll get in trouble.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
The beach.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
I don't want to eat it.
Beautiful!
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
Which language?
Help me out, will you?
Touch her.
What?
...Joe.
What happened?
Without your pants.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
You really like that shirt?
What glasses.
She's the toughest to read.
You're doing great with her.
What am I supposed to do?
Is that all?
It's not your time. I get time off.
Osaka.
What do I do?
On what?
Come on, she's getting away.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
One of your instincts?
Ow!
I can't see a thing.
Never mind, just say it.
It's him.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
He hung us up dry.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Gimme a minute.
About what?
Now, you're too suspicious.
She is beautiful.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
What part what?
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I'm...scared.
What happened?
In him?
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
**?!! 
Surveillance Cameras?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
He work for us?
What Job?
Bit expensive, sir.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
He's not an ordinary man.
I don't want to intrude.
It is to me too.
...Foreign service.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
What?
Remember what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Fine. You look fine.
We're here.
Here?
Oh.
Joe.
Ahhh...nothing.
Just give me the keys.
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
And you.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
I waited for you.
Why?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
...and sort of...disinterest.
You did.
You're doing...Okay.
...Naw. Made that up.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
They left. I had to go with them.
They kidded me a little.
There's not much to tell.
Last night?
Who did?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
Why?
What's he done?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Oh sure.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
And Dieter.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Now what?
We figure out if it's in here.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I can't fly it.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
That I really don't know.
What?
Why did you, then?
How?
Now what?
I'll come back for you.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Come on.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
It will be fine. You have another.
Just one. The back up.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
It doesn't hurt.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
What does he know?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hi, Daddy.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Three hours.
We gotta hook up.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Are you all right?
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Shit...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
What was that about?
Sure.
Maybe later.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Come again?
Hey, Lowell.
Why?
You ready...?
I can take her.
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Uh, what are those boxes?
That's my stuff from the office...
I didn't want to leave it there...
What's going on?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
That's right...
Yeah.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Oh, lots.
Give me a break!
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Mike... in my...
Coffee?
How have you liked your stay?
Who's that?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
How much would I get paid?
Should I just take the documents now?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
What do...
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
You believe that?
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Good. But Jeff...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Yeah, great.
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
What about now?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Poor communication skills.
Object to the form of the question!
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
They hate each other --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
So she's uh, flourishing?
What part?
That's his lawyer.
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Grounds?
Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What do you mean, was.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Gotcha.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
So I hear. Is that all?
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
No. Don't stop.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Thank you.
And here I thought my mother was...
Friends?
What is it Miles?
Yes.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
Comfy!
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
You can't prove anything.
Meaning my house.
Hello?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
It's a no go, Joe.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Who's that?
You used his credit card.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Do you know him?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Is this Ming?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
So what?
Yes?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
That's delusional.
Ha Ha.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Rex, please.
Thank you.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I'm not sure.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
What's Kirshner?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
And she has...?
Wrigley!
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
What...?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Yes, sir?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Yeah.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
You're a peculiar chap.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
What's this about not eating?
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Stunt?
Oh, yes. I heard.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Oh, no.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Who is he?
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Fine man to fall in love with.
He's marvelous!
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
Peter Warne! 
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
You talk as if
They're practically all the same, sir. 
But it's King Westley on the phone.
What happened to your money?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
No.
Huh?
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
My ticket?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
I didn't ask for your advice. 
I never thought of that.
That's none of your business.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
Do you mind putting out the light?
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage. 
High time you got back.
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
To New York?
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
Peter
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
knowbut
wasbut
was so scaredthat it scared
What?
What are you thinking about?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You think it's simple, huh?
Clever.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
You! Don't make me laugh.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
What about money?
I hope you got your money.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Where's the bus to New York?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
In about fifteen minutes.
Husband?
Yesif he is your husband.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
But can't you wait until morning
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
I've been thinking about you.
What time is it?
What's 'at?
Yeah.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I am, Joe.
You!
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
I ain't got a hat.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
Mush. Mush.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Who?
Not a minute!
Yeah.
Huh?
Thanks. 
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
What was his voice like?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Yeah, I guess you do.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
No, I'm not...
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Yeah.
What's it look like, Nick?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
What did they...
It leads farther than that.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Why?  What's wrong?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Then who killed the President?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
...you heard echoes.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
I don't believe it!
A Perry Russo?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Who?
David Ferrie.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Please answer the question.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Honey, you all right? 
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Huh?
Oh no!... How bad?
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
You know who the mayor was?
Who?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Jim Garrison?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Never touched me.
You have other information?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Was he there often?
Where is Banister in all this?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Germany.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
And what would I have to do?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Do you walk home?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Who?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
I need a favor.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Course you didn't.
Why were you with him?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
What's going on?
She wants to make a deal.
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
Fine.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
What's her name?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I'd love one, but not there.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
You gain weight?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
He's the one who wants you.
How many trips did you make?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
You get a chance to use it?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
What?... What'd you do?
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Catching a movie.
How was it?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
I'm old enough to be her father.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
He tries to act cool.
The day you got me out of jail?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
You do that?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
It'll be more than that.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Tell him you want to see him?
Why?
What do you tell Nicolet?
He's already there.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Less ten percent.
What's he doing?
We're partners.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Oh, so now you know him?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
What's her story?
And splittin' with her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
You said that the last time.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
But you didn't do that.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Sure.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
Are you getting that black suit?
Do you got something for me?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Yeah?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I understand woman, damn!
You told them that?
It's true, isn't it?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
Who?
I don't know. One of your friends.
A woman.
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
But you don't?
Can you cover that?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Drink?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I was there, I saw her do it.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Man, I don't like that part.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Designer clothes.
Where you gonna be during all this?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Four days ago.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
You're fourteen years old here?
Were you a disco girl?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
So where did you go?
Where were you?
With Ordell?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Wanna fuck?
You live with him.
And your point is?
Lemme have the bag.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Thanks, Baby.
Then what?
Whatcha watchin'?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
An employee I had to let go.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
Couldn't talk to her?
So you're sure she's dead.
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Came outta where?
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
What?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
How am I supposed to know that?
How can I help you?
Yeah.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Livingston, huh?
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Haven't a clue.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Hey, Max.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
You didn't hear?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
You know who this is?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
All I did was walk out with it.
In a way, yes.
She's been there since Thursday night.
No.
Give me his home number.
Get me out of here.
What are you then?
Della?
I see.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Daddy!
Stop!!!!
I could have told you that.
Short? It's ended.
Hello.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
There was a bang.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
Not me, buddy.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Who?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I had this weird flash just then.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
What? By myself?
I'm walking, aren't I?
I haven't seen her in months.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Whataya mean, no record?
It's not healthy with it closed.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
They stole it.
What happened to you?
No. The little one.
They're weird names.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
What's in here?
Lemme see.
What's wrong?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
They weren't human!
You okay?
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where are we?
Where?
What'd the doctor say?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
He did? When?
While you were in the shower.
What? What do you mean?
What's he talking about?
It's just me.
Jezzie?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You look upset.
Jake, what is it?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You can have anything you want.
Don't be funny.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
WHO ARE YOU?
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Like it was yesterday.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
They're awfully heavy.
Where's Wong?
You got a nice tan, though.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
We're doing everything we can.
Hello.
Nothin' much.
I need to see you, Jake.
Nope.
What's goin' on Paul?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Why not?
What do you mean?
Oh God. I know. I know.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
You come home with me.
Died?
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Pour it in.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Duck fuckers?
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
What?
Bomb?
Okay that hurt.
Nice touch.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
How many?
Hurry!
Boeman, the ships not here.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Get them in the lab!
You're a teacher.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Sergeant!
I'm with you kid.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Fuckin A...
Where is everybody? What happened?
Give me a break! What happened?
Hey.
What's this?
I couldn't save them.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
You okay?!
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Yuck.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
Push off toward us.
You lost the charge?
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What are you doing?
Kay-em 14.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
It's just you and me, then.
Kay-em you okay?
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
I don't understand...what does he want?
I'm sending you the files.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
But...I...400 years?
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
Can we get through these?
My boat's neat, dad!
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
You got it.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
This is Matt Hooper...
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
It's my charter. My party.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
The wire's showing!
What's that one, there?
That's it! Radio in for help!
He's trying to sink us!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
You too, sweetheart...
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Who's that young man?
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
My kids were on that beach...
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
What stinks so bad?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Chum?
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
I hope we get some more help.
You here for the summer?
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Leg of lamb this time?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Transplants?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Anti-Shark cage.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Is that normal?
Jesus, Bleek.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We could get back together too.
I totally heard you did.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Huh?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Why?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
Excuse me?
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Blood and guts.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
What do you play?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
When was this, like '96?
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Yeah?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
The Wizard of Gore?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Cool.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
What's the matter?
But you're old!
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Elbow.
Your name, please?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
You're pregnant?
Who is the kid?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Yeah, she does.
Dad, no!
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
There are ads? For parents?
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
Aw, please Junebug?
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
So. What's that thing?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
What would be a good time for you?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Yeah, downtown.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
...I said, I like your hair.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Yeah.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
What's your name, boy?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey mostly.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Who?
Now why is that?
Yeah.
Sure.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
What happened to Adele?
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Why?
I like that.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Early, just think...
What is it?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Yes. Altogether.
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Oh man, that's the best.
How?
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Shit.
You think he's got any herb?
You think?
78th.
Telly.
It is right.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Yeah.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Oh. You like her?
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
How much you gonna take?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Casper, where's Telly.
Nothen' B.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You goin'?
Yeah.
What?
Sup then? Sup?
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Yeah?
Do you like kissing me?
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
No...
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Because your a virgin?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Do you care about me?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Thanks.
Yeah?
Your a real philosopher.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Telly says was up.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yep.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Right.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
It was... it was.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
Morpheus.
What?
Are you crazy?
I wouldn't know.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
The door was open.
No.
Then let's narrow it down.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
What do you mean, stand out?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Who is this?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Why not?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
You'll find her.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Why her?
What makes you think I was there?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
What word did you leave last night?
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Very good.  How did you know?
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
What is it?
You might not have done it had you known.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Why did he?
You must be Erica.
Uh huh.
Is your dad here?
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Congratulations, dad.
What are you doing up?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
You ready?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
You mean, no prints but hers?
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
Well?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
And this Jeremy--
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
As large as castles.
What time did he get there?
We're going to work on the message.
The most logical choice.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Did you send the car?
Peter...
You're always in the middle of a match.
You have something you want to say?
About what?
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
How come you don't stay with them?
Are you with the tournament?
Are you one of the players?
Sounds very violent.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
What are you looking for?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
How can you look at it so clinically?
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Let's change the subject.
Of course.
No.
Why?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Hi.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
I got lucky.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Have they harmed you?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
I will find you. I will be with you.
You must move away from the Center.
Will your power outward.
Take the western passage.
They have Lyssa!
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
Turold's son was to marry her.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
There is no other way.
There is nothing.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
<u>Why</u>?
Never.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
Use your sword.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
We must try to get horses.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
These we'll pay for.
Hand over your dinner.
Go, join them.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
What is that awful looking place?
Where are you going?
My heart stays here.
No.
We meant only to please you.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Look at its insides.
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Yes.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
Few have survived it.
Each to his fate, lad.
Look.
Who speaks that name!
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
It is no trickery.
Knowledge.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
...Office 2702.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Why can't I have a bank account?
Huh... 500 meters?
Rocket launcher.
What?
Mathilda? May I come in?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
I love you so much, Leon.
...No...
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
May I ask you a personal question?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Don't fear.
...Composer.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh? Why?
...And how much is it?
...Who sent you?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Yes... Twice.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
He probably just went somewhere.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
It's impossible.
What if you don't make it?
I'll make it.
No it's not.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
What would you like us to do?
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Yes -- you are.
I know what you're getting at.
You do?
Okay.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
I do love you... very, very much.
Show me.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
I don't know.
I know where my heaven is.
Why there?
Pacifica, California.
What's his story?
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Where?
I'm walking there Kris.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
In a hospital.
You're in pain.
... My father.
I don't have kids.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
Evening News?
It's yours.
I really want that watch.
What do you want?
What are my choices?
No alcohol?
Coffee?
Hello!
Are you working?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
What's up?
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Sera...
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
What do you mean?
What was that all about?
I don't understand any of that.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
I wanted to see you...
How'd this happen?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Yuri... are you...
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
Why would I kill my husband?
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Go to hell.
You're fired. I have new representation.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's not what's important.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Sit down.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
You're not going up there.
What's going on?
I'm sorry?
Uh -- both?
I don't know.
What'd you do?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
No.
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Good one.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
How'd it go at the trial?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
It's not my alibi to tell --
I know. He has it sent out.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Up for a celebration dinner?
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
I did?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Maybe she found him like that.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
That's not entirely --
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Good. Good.
Now I am.
I didn't mean --
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
You look -- nice.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Yes.
Three months.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Why do you say that?
Hovering?
Is it a Kappa?
Fool's magic.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Then we smash 'em?
Fire moat... why do that?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
Always.
We go out, smash 'em now?
Birdies... pretty...
What do you want with me?
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
But I'm hideous!
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Do it now!
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
I see...
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
You come stealee tleasoo?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Enough!
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
It's bluebells!
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
But... but, why?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Don't you know?
And if she thinks me a liar?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
By the grace of God.
Damn them!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Fine-looking army.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nice piece of work.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Easily spoken...
What magic have we on our side?
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
The wound is mortal.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
I don't... understand.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
What weapon?
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Don't get too far!
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Well done, lad.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
A gentleman would offer water.
What shall we do?
They rival the angels of paradise.
Are you honest?
Where are you going?
What happened?
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
I'm afraid it may storm.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Lili!  No!
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
Pinching me!
Pinching?  Where?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
What's this now?
Not very precise directions.
What became of the princess?
As fair as me?
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Please...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Heading north still?
Where?
Lost?
Simple as that, eh?
Can you show us the way?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
What are you doing?
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Are you going to see Sam again?
Mom said I should.
I'm going to bed.
Are you his friend?
Don't you have school?
I had them in my pocket.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
Hey.
He jumped into the ocean.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I'll get your back.
Really?
Really?
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
What are you talking about?
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Not really.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Where are you?!
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Oh, yes.
And if I enclosed it?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
What are you on?
Right...she married...what was he?
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
I've got one favor to ask.
What can I do for you, George?
Is Alyssa home?
She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
To check up on me?
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
I'll hate you forever.
Are you totally insane?!
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
No one would blame me if I left!
I'm not doing it!
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I can promise you complete privacy.
I don't know.
You're too fucking late.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I know.  Why?
What would you like to be?
I know parts of who you are.
He's got nothing to do with me.
I wish you had told me then.
I gave up on you.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
You look better than ever.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Can you build a house in four months?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Thanks for telling me.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
She needs to be alone, I think.
You should lock your doors.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Where have you been for a week?!
What did you do with your dog?
But you can't call me while you think?
I need to talk to you.
Why call me?
Money?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I don't have a phone.
Last time you were gone for a week!
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I used to live here.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Do you remember?
It's been a while.
I smiled at him.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
That was the truth.
You've never said that before.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
His father is a man.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
The biggest waste of time since television.
After the kids are back in school.
What?
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
No.
I guess I could teach you some things.
Can you stay for dinner?
You could keep it and rent it out?
Why?
Queer.
All day again?
Dad's home, already?
A night in the hole?
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Is Spanky here?
Sharp.
She's alright, isn't she?
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
Sure, boss.
I got it... boss.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
What?
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Oooh...
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Alright. You want some pie?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
He even got my daddy's watch.
He's dead.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
What does that mean?
Forget it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Don't mention it.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
You get ketchup?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Crop duster.
Well, if that's the way it is...
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Go where, Ray?
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
All in, boss!
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
So it don't exist.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
Apparently, your sister died.
Jenny?
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Who?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What are you in for, Willie?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?
Where'd you get this?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Is this a joke?
Hello, Cassius.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Urr... uggg... errr...
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I'll call her later.
She goes to Parson's, right?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Where is he? He's late.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
Everything's fine, pop.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
You're a good devil, Dad.
How bad?
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Coulda been much worse.
Hey.
Thanks.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
It's Stanley, sir.
Hey...
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Schnapps...
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
So I followed him...
Good idea... kill me.
You gotta kill yourself.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
My dad's an optometrist.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Sometimes, sure.
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Hey.
What were you thinking coming here?
What are you doing?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
I love you.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
From? From? From?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Answer the question!
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
How did they get in here?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
That was a great shot you made.
Did you?
Anybody we know?
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
Here.
When do you go up?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
No.
I changed my mind.
And now?
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
Not about that.
Why is it wrong to run?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
Six. I go red next year.
Why tell me?
It's different now. Help me.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
What're you going to do?
Maybe you'll think of something...
If you trusted me, you'd know.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
How will they know we're coming?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
I don't know.
No.
What belongs to the people?
Come with us.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
How long have you been living here?
For as long as I can remember.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
I'm sorry.
Yes...
Can you make it back?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
I'm, okay... You okay?
You're a musician?
Why not?
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
You recognize that guy?
His or ours?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Yeah, I remember.
Sure.
Hello.
Pornos.
Are you my man?
Yes.
Where's the bathroom?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Sure.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Hey.
Sit down a minute.
The police called us.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
The wife killer?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Out in back.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
That's not Fred Madison?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
What's bothering you, Madison?
We've met before, haven't we?
At your house. Don't you remember?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
A videotape.
Does it say anything on the tape?
It must be from a real estate agent.
Good book, huh?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
What night?
I called, you know.
Called? When?
We will.
What?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Give that a try.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
You like pornos?
How ya doin', Pete?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Yeah.
No. No, I don't.
Whatiya mean?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I was?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
What about those men we met this morning?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Sorry.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Look here
He might have lost his way.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
No kidding?
Yes.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
What are we going to do?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Gold. You were going to
Well - I'm
And mine's Conway.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
You have no disputes over women?
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Centuries.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Shall we have another?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Oh, I'm so glad.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
As far away as I ever want to be.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Are you the High Lama?
What is it, my son?
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
Sondra Bizet.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Mine?
Bob! I think I hear motors!
Yes.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
What are these people?
Oh George, come on.
What's it mean?
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
What do you mean if we should get out?
Did I say "if"?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Nothing about the porters yet?
What about the porters?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Oh, George . . .
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
You can't take her away from here!
Why not?
The clothes?
Where did you come from?
Good.
In for what?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
A man whose life was empty!
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Bump?
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Struggling, why?
Why, mother?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
What do you want him to do?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Thank you.
You shot an eight year old girl.
Cowan--
Cowan--
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
No. just peace on Earth.
And if I say yes?
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Well this didn't.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
You do?
Helluva night, isn't it?
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
I taught kindergarten.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Something's wrong here.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
And what's this ... ?
You think that's what's-happening?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
It's marble.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
Sure.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
How could it not?
Nowhere.
Er. well, nowhere special.
I dunno. One?
It's... coming.
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Will it lower the curve?
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Which way?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
I'm getting a trajectory...
Where's he making his big speech?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
How'd you know?
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
He'll turn around.
Agatha...
Where are we going?
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Who wanted her little girl back?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
That's not much.
It's all I could safely move.
Yes, you did.
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How do I find the --
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Yes, sir.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
You're kidding, that's today?
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Yeah?  So?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Red Ball?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Why did you catch that?
To them.
Really?  You've never been inside?
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
You gonna tell on me?
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
Okay... now let me time you.
It's a little late for that.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I forgive you...
Some -- somebody's father?
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Let go of the gun.
You're not gonna kill me...
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Heal who?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
And how did Lamar become involved?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
The system would collapse.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
This is all my fault.
Sean --
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Lamar, I found something.
I don't understand --
I wanna kill my boss.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
John Anderton was my friend!
Who?
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
It was nobody's fault.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Is it a good room?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
So?
What, sir?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
Thank you, sir.
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
It's on West Broadway.
Manhattan.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Holy shit.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Oh no. What is it this time.
We used to take baths together.
Bullshit.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
No.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
Chloe?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
I'm ready.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Well, that's not gonna happen.
I feel weird asking him.
No coke tonight.  Right?
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Ho's a good guy --
Goodbye, Bobby.
I said no touching.
Well, you look it. You win?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Ricky's taken care of.
You like the ponies?
You bet the ponies?
This one?
She was fast, huh?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
What?
I didn't say that.
I don't understand.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
I know.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
A bad heart.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Nah.
Yeah.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Understand me?
Ruiz isn't here.
What about it?
What are you saying?
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you.
I thought you hate that club.
We don't need guns.
You wanna go right now?
We look good this year.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Fuck him.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
What are we delivering?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
It's not even yours.
Nice work.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
Who's driving her?
Right here's fine.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Pretty nice.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
You sure?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much was it?
Forty-six.
Yeah, I guess.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing.
They asked who it was.
I don't know.
Like I said, I don't know.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
What the hell did you do?
What the fuck was that about?
Where?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
The what?
The penguin house.
We need guns.
All the more reason.
No.
Eighty five.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
I'm sorry...
It's gonna be fine.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Three and a half hours?
Tom. How's it going?
Yeah. I want it.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
S'up.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
A little.
You look good, man.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Why? What I say bad?
You really in trouble?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
What do you want?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Good morning.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
So you're our own private guy?
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
Can I borrow a piece of --
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Edinburgh.
I'll get it.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Bet you like that shit.
Man's rep travels.
Is your papa West Indian?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
Solid, daddy.
It hit?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
Take it easy, baby.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, what do you want?
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
That's what Mama used to say.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I will do it.
I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I can't.
Tell Him that.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Could we sit down someplace?
What?
How do you like it?
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Just an idle question.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Did you see the papers today?
And like a fool I believe it.
You know that gal?
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
I better not come in.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Murder.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
Get out.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
How many you turning out?
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
You the man.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Me?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
That's a fine chick.
That ain't bad.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
I'm the man.
Watch your tongue, boy.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Where are you coming from?]
[Why?]
[Senor?]
So what do I get in return?
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
I show, you give me the information?
[Si.]
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The what?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[Where do I find him?]
[Who's he?]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[I want you.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[And?]
Were you provided with a gun?
Yes.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
How does it affect you?
I'm here.
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Nothing wrong.
So how's business?
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
How long you staying, Crease?
You did something on impulse?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
What are you doing here?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Yes or no?
Potential? I don't understand.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
I'm a bargain.
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
How do you think he got out?
Well, I let him go.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Why do you ask?
You feel sorry for the husband?
I dropped her at home.
You think too much?
You got that right.
The world of our children. How dare they?
You've done much of this work before?
No.
What was her name?
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
Good news. You're going back to school.
I like him, Mom.
Our child's safety is at stake.
She likes him.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
That's ridiculous.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[I know this. Your point?]
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
And they took that away.
Hey, Herbie...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
What for?
All right, I'll see you!
Who you gonna call?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Hey! What are you doing here?
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Well, it ain't your baby.
You told me.
What they say?
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Were the lights on?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
Marty...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
I'm stag.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
You gonna get married.
You not ugly.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
I heard you, Ma.
I don't like her.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Sure.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Waddaya talking about?!!
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Never this close.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Miss you, Walt.
Epidural hematoma?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
So long, Ho-Jon.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Is that liquor?
A football game?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
C-A-M-E-M...?
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Look.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
What do we do?
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
It isn't always this rough?
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Something else we have in common.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Why would he do that?
I didn't have much choice.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Why can't you look at him?
He's coming to.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
No, never in the slightest.
The blonde dish.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
O'Reilly!
Yes, sir?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Oh, get out of here!
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Damn.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Nice.
Did you get it, too?
Huh?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Yes!
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
How much money do you get?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh!
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
The Websters!
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
There is no letter.
You made it up.
A deal?
I can read. I can read!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Duets? But can we trust him?
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Where's Connell?
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Oh, let me go, will you!
Baseball?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Hello! . . . Yeh?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
What?
Yeah, Boss?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
The heelots!
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
No!
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Yeah. It certainly is.
Sure.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
No.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
That's a lie!
That's got nothing to do with it!
What difference does that make?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Racket? What do you mean?
Yeah.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
No, sir.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
What happened? Is there a problem?
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
How can I help you with the particles?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Am I gettin' the car?
What?!
Manual or automatic?
Automatic.
Hold on a second here.
...a car.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
What's the suspect's name?
Being faxed over now.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
How do you feel after a shooting.
I've rarely shot anyone.
Recruited you from where?
It was okay.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Is there something wrong with that?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
Still needs work.
They need to run first and second?
We lost.
How many have you lost?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
So what do you want to do?
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
You think I didn't need you?
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Yeah?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Where's the damn wire?!
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Roper.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
The car is part of the deal.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
I can't do that.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Any verification on numbers.
Are these yours?
This is Halden.
There are two million people in there with you.
True.
Why?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
Guests?
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
The new world.
You were the one who was dying.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Dream?!
How long?
Who?
Take care.
He had keys.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
What is it?
Who did he digitize?
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Not his style.
There was no need to kill her.
An interface attendant.
What brings you inside?
Cleaning up a mess.
You went to my high-school?
-- The inside?
Realize?
And it meant something.
Sorry?!
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
This.  No point to it.
Resurrection.
Standard, modern, upscale --
What?!
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
Anybody see anything?
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
I see... a fox
What's a Triac?
Let's go after him!!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
And how do we do that?
... A falcon?
GET OFF ME!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
"Basically".
How'd you know?
I am the mighty ape!
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
We're asking you to go to prison.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
Boo-Boo.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
I had everything. Once.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Well...
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Would it be painful for you?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Meyer just finished the books.
We'll figure out something.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
This business is about taking risks.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
The kid just called me stupid.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
And how many soldiers do you have?
I've got friends.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
He's an animal!
What about the share.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
They do what I tell 'em.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Wanna know what I think?
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Where's the stiff?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Maranzano wants you dead.
Yes?
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
What a cozy little scene.
Anything!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Take any one ya like.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Who did this?
Switch hands.
What?
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
<u>Why</u>??
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
What's the matter?
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Got a doctor on duty.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
What's the "bad" part?
I might wake up.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
What's the matter?
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Hypnos?
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Don't ask where I got it.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Stu...Stu...
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Who told you we deal drugs?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What pictures?
What's wrong?
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Never.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Looks like it, but--
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Huh?
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
What do I play?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
What dame?
"There's more light here," he says--
Yeah. Funny--
My friends?
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
I'll cherish ya.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
My first name's--Clarissa.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
Why me?
What!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
Taylor, my dear.
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
One minute! Just one minute!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Aw--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Washington!
Look! There it is!
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Will he *yield*?
For a *question*.
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Will the Senator--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Just fine.
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Can't you?
The man downstairs said number--
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Whose statue is that?
No. What had you better--?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Right.
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Oh, just a day--
Committee.
Why?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Yes, I see that.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Pardon?
On paper?
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Have you always had to--work?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
No!
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Must have been tickled pink.
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Thanks a lot.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Hello.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Order, gentlemen!
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Let's get away from here. 
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
What do you want, Senator?
Yes--
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
What do you think?
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield?
Senator Paine will state it!
Order!
Order!
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
That's going to be fun.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Good morning.
Deeds?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Who's that?
Since he was born.
Pixilated.
Sometimes he whistles.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Any children?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Thank you very much.
No. Are you?
I haven't.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, but I
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Oh, thank you!
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Now, what do you see?
Here's a nice place.
Really?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
He did? I play the tuba
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
Ready?
A girl?
Well, here we are again.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
I'm crucifying him.
People have been crucified before.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Huh?
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Uh-huh.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
How'd you get the picture?
Had the boys follow us.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
Sure.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Come on, come on!
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Fourteen carat?
We'll send for the police!
Your Honor, I object.
It's a lie!
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
I can't find him.
Yes?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
All set.
How do you do.
Why, no.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
No, thanks.
Have a drink?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Uh-huh.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Oh.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
We provide opera.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Me?!
Naturally.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Mrs. Semple?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Look, he's temperamental.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Oh, the poet? Where?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
South Dakota - north?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
No, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
What's that?
Prairie? Oysters?
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I did what!
Please!
Looking for?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Shall I call the police, sir?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
Doubtful. What did he say?
Uh-huh.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
But you do therapy?
...And I from Phyllis.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
I see.
Why not?
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
What do you do?
What do you think's wrong with her?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Oh?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You do?
It was Henry Follett.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Lily.
Okay.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
What it might take is... doing time.
Hello, Lionel.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Ph.D., psychologist.
I think you know what I mean.
Could I see Sofie, please?
What would you do?
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
No.
Is this the treatment?
Sorry... I'm done.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Be specific.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Disgusting.
You like it?
Which thing?
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
That's... good?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Is it something you've heard about me?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Hello.
Oh.
Will you be here?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What happened today?
He agreed?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
This is great!
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Jerking off?
Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Sounds like you have several.
Things got a lot worse.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Psych major?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Lily.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
That was a terrible thing.
You know where he's taking her?
And what ritual would that be?
Oh yes, of course.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Now go find me a big stick.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
None of the above, thank you.
My very good friend! What a surprise.
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
What does he want the book for?
What just happened?
And what is he in prison for?
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
And what did he say?
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
You swear?
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
We're almost there.
Preparation for what?
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
That bad huh?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
I think you were jealous
Got it!
You...! YOU...!
Have you no respect for the dead?
Yes?
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
That just makes you more gullible.
Do you really think he'll show up?
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
Where's my gun?
You did not!?... We're not!?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
So who killed him?
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
Eat your mustard.
How's your dad?
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Should I kill them?
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
And the light goes out...
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
I'm not that kind of girl.
I'd better go.
Date?
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
It is?
Roy.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
What have they got that we ain't got?
It's me.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
What are you talking about?
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
You drink too much.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
We had an off night, that's all.
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's a big difference.
GET MAD!
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Cover me!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
Or flowers.
Agents?
Maybe there was traffic.
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
Firepower costs money.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Wow.
Jeffrey!
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
What do you mean?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Please...
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
About 5,000 troops.
Any cannon?
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Fair enough.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
I'm not insulted.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Yes, sire?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
A glass of champagne, please.
Yes, I am.
Oh -- where do you come from?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Hello there, Picart.
Four o'clock.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
What is that?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
And he sent you to me?
Does your mother know you have come?
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
I very much doubt that he will.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Would you like some brandy?
No -- not as a rule.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
May I offer you a drink?
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were you in love with any of them?
I cannot promise you that.
I will never forgive you.
Yes -- what is it?
Open the door.  It's me.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
There's probably some explanation.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
You wrote it.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Can you give me a drink, please?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
And, where did you see my portrait?
Yes, I do -- very much.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
No.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
And I can go free?
Naw, it ain't like that.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Yeah.
You paid cash?
It's cool, but where's the water?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
No.  Thought he was with you.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Stretch it out.
Yes you did.
No I'm not.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
You straight?
Just a little.
I walked.
$247.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
What we gonna do?
You see that?
What's the B-G's?
Naw, you go first.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
You're welcome, Unc.
Karla.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
I don't know.
What are you doing here?
You did all this for me?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Can I help you?
I do.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
It's alright.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
You too.
Smokin' what?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Are they still out there?
I do.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Roach...Roach, come on.
Hey.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
20 minutes?
Ah damn.  Damn.
I got fired too.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Just do it.
Ezal!  Ezal!
I'll take you later.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Nothing.  What you want?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Elroy.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
What happened here?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
San Diego.
What?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
I remember you...in the elevator.
Who did?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
For not believing you.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Daddy?
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
I will do no such thing.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
What would you do in my place?
Tell me why I miss him.
You killed him.
I killed you.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
Is that something precious?
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
I don't know.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Will you promise me that?
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
You got anything smaller?
You remember me?
Oh, man...
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
That's right.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Irene is going to help.
You're going to go see her.
I don't know.
What are you going to do!?
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
That's pretty good.
You're a big girl, huh?
I've got something for you.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
That's enough.
Yeah.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Where's your Mom?
Here they come.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Uncle Birdie!
She went.
Yes! Yes!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Who?
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
The money, Icey.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
Satan.
What!
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Hing, hang, hung.
Hm?
Where's Mom?
Why?
Where are we goin', John?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
John, where are we g --
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Don't you hurt her!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
John, where's your folks?
Where ye from?
Story, honey? Why, what story?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What are you doing, boy?
What's taking you so long about it?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I'll tell.
Don't you believe me?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Now: Where?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Now it's your turn.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Can I have milk too?
About our secrets.
No. No one never did.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Mister Powell?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Harry, what --
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Them kids is yours?
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
Pearl and John!
I been bad!
He never asked me for nothin'.
What?
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Guess I did.
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
The killer.
You do?
My dream.
How you plan to do that?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
What!?
How you doing, pal?
Just want to talk to him a second.
Dad -- what you doing here?
Sure, but...
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
How you know that?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
School.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Bring me forty-five back.
Aren't you late?
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
Tell me... what else did you have?
What was it like?
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
And there?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
He's cutting our throat...
Misha! Misha!
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Have you?
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
We can call our ambassador.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne... 
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
We don't want to be disturbed.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Comrade.
A week?
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Yes, monsieur.
Allow me, Comrade.
We did our best, Comrade.
We did it with the best intentions...
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
Give me another double brandy.
What can I do about it?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Business.
Confess what?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
I think so too.
You're going to force us... huh?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Why should I take a chance?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
Me?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
No.
Thank you.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
Don't do it, please.
Wounded? How?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
Was that talkative?
Oh, let it ring.
Let's forget that we ever met.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
I didn't follow you.
This is a place for workmen.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Just smile.
Why?
I have never heard one.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Yes.
You see? Life can be so simple.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Would that make you any happier?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
But I can throw it out of the window.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
They belong to the people.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Did you win?
Oh, Leon!
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Did I hear something about jewels?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
No.
You haven't seen her yet?
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
That bad?  Old or young?
Thank you.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
I'm afraid that's what it is.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
We have nothing to discuss.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
I told you to go, madame.
Where are they?
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Go on.
Good morning, Comrade.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Yes.
Yes... leaving immediately.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Raw carrots and beets.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
My jewels?!
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
We'll see about that ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
Is it?
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
How so?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
Where's Hunt now?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
This is not a joke, John!
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
May I say something, Mr. President?
No, sir, you did not.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
So?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
Yes, you approved it, sir.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
All right.
Just do what I say, Bob.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
We really must go, Mr. President.
What?
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
I believe you're right, boss.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
What about happiness, Mother?
My friends call me "Mister President."
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Yes.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
No.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Kissinger?
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
How the fuck did you know?
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
So, what's this about, Dick?
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
Uh, wait ...
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... give me a break, Mary.
... Use his women.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
Elvis I like, too.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
Sir?
That's right.
What's in there?
So I'm supposed to be ...
No, sir ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Are you serious?
Is that the truth?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Then I'll be there for you.
Because ... I have to relax.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Congratulations, Dick.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Why didn't you?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
Don't be ridiculous!
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
What?
Some say you are, Rocky.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
Yes, you've circled round.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
You don't know what he thinks.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
No I ain't.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Yes ma'am, I do.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
...You ride Winston.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
So when was he here?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
No sir.
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
I always am.
What do you think.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well I didn't see it.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Llewelyn!
What're you doin', baby?
So... for how long do we have to...
Promise?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What makes you say that?
She'll be all right.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
What's this about?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
Airport.
...You need to talk to me.
Why would I care where you're going.
...I know where you are.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
I was just passin' the time.
Is somethin' wrong?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Sir?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Just call it.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Sir?
Tent poles.
The kind with the most poles.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
That's twenty-six dollars.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
What room?
When did you last see him.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yessir.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
Okay. We can stop that.
You tell me the option.
The what?
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Half.
...But that won't last.
How would you describe him?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
It's called a transponder.
Not that way.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
The heroin. You don't have it.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
You do, I reckon.
Are you in the service?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
...I meant your food.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Sheriff, I don't...
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Did you send anyone out there?
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Yeah?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
"Banners?"
Need something else?
You must be joking.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I'd rather not...
...what're you saying?
Did you watch it yet?
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Maroon.  I stole it.
What?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Are you and Larry happy?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I don't think your friend likes me.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
I have... did it sound that bad?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
Sure you don't want any salad?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
I got you, Del...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I don't know.
Roy! What are you doing here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Where you headed, Betty?
Los Angeles, California.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
No. Loma Vista.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
Like Rome?
Worse.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
The Five?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
God, that's awful!
What? Where was he?!
Looking for someone?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
He is real.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
No, almost never.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
What are you doing?
...this is your sweater, right?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Fine. You got five...
Could you give us an example?
Like what?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Relax, we brought the cash.
That's right.
You told me how to do it!
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
...that's a good motto.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
Half.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I never said that I believed...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
I see.  May I?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
We know that...
Can I have an evil twin?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Hmm?
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
You lie, motherfucker...
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Waitaminute -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
Hang on there -
It ain't the law!
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
How'd he know about the treasure?
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Four hundred, Delmar.
Izzat right?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Them straw polls is ugly.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Suckin' away.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Where's your ring, honey?
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
It's just a symbol, honey -
- in the gods - Huh?
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You -
Well, I'm sorry honey -
I counted to three, honey.
The preacher said it absolved us.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It was a moment a weakness!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
It's bona fide!
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Why?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Great ass.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I never said any of that!
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Good morning, girls.
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Yes, Joe.
When did this happen?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
I want to fly, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
No, sir!
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
It's important, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
No, sir.
No, sir.
Louder!
Yeah.
Something tells me you've been here before.
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
I'm a little late, that's all.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
You what?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
What?
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
No. I never feel like that.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Be a friend. Leave.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
I'm looking for Sid.
Why'd he do it?
I'd like to come with you.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
No problem, but who's Susan?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
What?
No problem.
There is not one thing funny here.
I can't...
One.  Squeeze.
I can't just...
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Open it.
And we're never getting in.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Could the child please stop that?
Oh, I've seen these...
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Suit yourself.
No, Edgar Allen.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Open the door.
Too many stairs.
478...
Nope.
Chills?
"What we want is in that room."
Fuck.
Got him!
What are you doing?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tell you...
What if I keep dropping?
What if I spazz out?
I'm sorry, Mom.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Well... is it loaded?
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
Like?
Yeah, it's me.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Hey... what the hell you doing?
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
...Glad you came man.
Naw... I gotta...
You want me to put a man on it?
Now hold on Rodgers...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Rodgers... this is no good...
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
That's right brother... listen and learn.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
We appreciate your help with this.
So what's the deal?
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Just a kid.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Huh?
Fuck is up?!
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
This cool the heat off you any?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
You believe that?
No.
Late summer.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Excuse me?
Do you?
Yes, sir.
Apology accepted.
Oh?
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Very well, proceed, sir.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
That is a separate issue.
Their names, ranks and posts?
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
And the Governor?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Is that so?
Did your father teach you humility?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That's right.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
He left us.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
It's Mister Marion.
A long time ago...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
And your principles?
I'm sorry.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
How far away?
Reverend.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Put those away.
But father, they might come this way.
Father... I killed those men...
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Yes.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
But--
Almost there, Louis.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Why? For God's sake, why?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
You want to rest a bit before you start?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
You and this old Indian rag-man--
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
What?
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I just said--
I got eggs down here!
I heard you tonight.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm going to try to do better.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
Aye, aye, sir!
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
I'll torture it out of you.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You can go to your grave not knowing.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
That so?
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
I'll drop it!
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Maid or not, it fits you.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
What?
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
Miss Swann.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
That was before I met one, of course.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
First -- have you found me a crew?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
You would do that?
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Move!
Why ask me?
Come aboard.
It's still against the law.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Tortuga?
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Yes, I have.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
He may be.
He's still breathing.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Please.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
No, thank you.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Pollution?
What did you use?
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Do you think she loves him?
Then you still love me?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Considering what?
If you loved me like I loved you?
That might work.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
What are you going to do?
I don't believe this is happening...
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Yes?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Susan!
When did you...?
Somebody has to.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
We don't?
Why?
Got it.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
What do these replicators do to people?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Just look at it!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You're not going after Argon!
God, what a fight that was.
We were different people then.
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Oh yes you are!
You were looking for us?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
Icky!
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
What in the hell?
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
Really?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Of course I am Stewart.
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
What are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Ah-ah-ah!
You're the Tribune man?
This way.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Yeah?
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Gloria Golden?
Right - for the first time this year.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Is that so?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
You what?
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
It's the smoke.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Nothing.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Conrad.
What do you know about Conrad?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
What could I be?
Here you are.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Hey, Gallagher!
Yeah?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Who was that?
No.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Surely, come right in.
Thanks. May I sit down?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
We just thought that
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
With pleasure, Madame!
Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
All right, Grandma
Have you seen this? 
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Shhh! Do you hear something?
You try it.
No, sir!
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
It's okay. It's alright.
Looks just like it did.
I won't.
Oh, hello Betty.
I think it looks nice.
Bud brought it to me.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Oh, George ...
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You want to get out of here?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
She won't go out with me?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
No. What?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
Are you alright?  What is it?
Did you do this?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
I think I've got something to say.
Dan! Arrest them!
What do you mean!?
How'd you know about the fire?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
What color is that hedge of yours?
What are you doing?
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
What's going to happen?
Who's that?
So what's the point?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You have no right to do this.
They're happy like this.
Me too. Sounds swell.
Not directly anyhow ...
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
What's wrong?
You're reading?
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Are you sure?
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
That was sure swell ...
Yeah.
You want some berries?
Rain.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
McIntire's.
McGinty's.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Hello there.
... Hi.
What?
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Oh--well ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Why don't you just take me back without it?
How long do you think you've been here?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Yeah ...
Yes.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Forget about that!
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
What's wrong?
I'll never be able to do that.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
Yes, I'll be there.
No, no, no.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
What's the listing?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
You just said very food.
You look nervous.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Yeah I can't.
Why?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Why's it here?
You're so scared.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
I....please don't do this.
Yes.
This is Georgia.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
No.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Yeah.
No. I'm sorry.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
-- you said you did.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
This is not cool.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Yeah, not really.
Oh My God.
Do you want to pick me up?
Yeah.
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
No, no. I did.
Yeah?
....yeah....
Is everything ok?
What?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
...yes I did...?
Are you learning how to play it?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
This is Barry.
This is Lena.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Lena?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Yeah.
Where do you have to go?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
It's a plastic, yeah.
Did you have my home phone number?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
On my knife.
Why? ...what?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
Barry Egan.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
Can we agree that that is that?
Sorry about that.
How many sisters do you have?
What's up?
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
No thanks.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Hi.
What?
Yes.
Is this where you live?
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
This is Barry.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Nothing.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Seriously.
You can't just stay in your house.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
That's it.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
We should be going --
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
Once or twice.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Ow!
Why not?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
Of course.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
Oh. That.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
And place my reputation at stake?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
It was fiction, of course.
Of course.
That's not our intent --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
And my own.
Poorly.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
But I am history.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
I'll be waiting.
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
Don't start --
Is it awfully violent?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Go on, child.
I am not a wealthy woman.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
It's tainted money, Doctor.
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Very much.
I'd rather read, thank-you.
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
That poor woman.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Uh-huh
Who are you, sir?
My name is Orson Welles
Do you?
Louis
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Marion--
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
There's a different between want and
I don't want you to--
Thank you for your time
I want blood
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
We're using-
Hearst?
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Showing life
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
Like a bug.
But with compassion and insight--
Manolete?!
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
This better be good
Please don't say this.
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
I expected more from you.
Let me out.
Listen to me-
Fuck you--
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
It doesn't have to be
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Why her?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
You gonna watch?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Very generous
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Please don't ask me to do this.
This is an abomination There's no music and--
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
Then find another theater
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
What's up, Colonel?
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
Believe what you want.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
What?
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Sure. What is it?
You heard me, I said hit me.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Answer me when I talk to you.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Go 'head.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
You wasn't with her, were you?
You wasn't with her?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
What did Tommy say?
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
No, I just told you what happened.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I did keep an eye...
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Does that mean...
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
I just wanted to say hello.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
You don't talk very much.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
I can't find my ball.
No.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Who asked you?
I was just...
Huh?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
I took the kids to my sister's.
What'd you see?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I am answering...
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
What?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
C'mon, Tommy --
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
He should.
How's the weight? Ok?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
I said, let's go.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Like disposing of their wives?
I'll bet it's been done.
You think I made all this up?
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
His wife took a trip.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Who said they left then?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
I can't do that.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
A detective's nightmare.
Ever get an answer?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
You think he's getting out of here?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Did you ever own a saw?
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Like what?
A possibility.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Wrong day?
Where?
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Jeff --
Why should I?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
I don't know what you mean.
No.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I predicted it.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
That's normal.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
No.
She's only perfect.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
People have different emotional levels that --
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Police?
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
I wonder.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
Would four of them -- ?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
No.
What do you need money for?
How much do you think you'll need?
Ten here.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Hello.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
And you love life?
Not too active.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Big enough?
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
You mean leave the magazine?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Of course not.
Three.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Wasn't that close?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
How?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
L. B. Jefferies.
Chelsea 2-5598.
A new disease.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Feel okay?
You know something?
Meaning me?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Machismo?
You satisfied or you want more?
How'd he get in?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
You still want to go home, Moose?
Tell him why we moved here.
You can't protect me.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
You thought I was Mom?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Yeah!  Shh!
That's funny!
Yes.
Shoot, Jimbo.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Well, now--
I don't think so--
Sorry.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
He's home.  I heard the car.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Hi.
Hi there.
No.  I don't think so--
I just don't want trouble.
He has a knife.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Are you really going to meet them?
Yeah?
Come out come out wherever you are!
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
What?
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
I came here before.
When was that?
I'm here.
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Why?
Who's that?
Plato!
Good Lord!
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
Pretty mixed up?
Hi.  I saw you before.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where what was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Dig the square wardrobe!
They'll be looking for you.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
You still pretty upset?
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
I'm getting that way, too.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Well--we're newlyweds.
You can't talk underwater!
How many rooms do you think there are?
Hi.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
You don't need to do that.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
You disappointed?
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
She's being called for.
How did you know that?
We were romantic then too--
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Gabriel!
Toys for... adults?
We sell children's toys --
I don't think it's negative five.
No, no --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
One more. Smile. One more.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Ashley, Jesus --
You need a COAT!
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
Get the hell off of me!
You're not hearing me here --
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
They've never done a robbery?
Nick...
So does it look a lot different?
Nick, what happened --
I love you, Nick...
I don't know...
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
No --
No, you can't --
What?
Samantha.
What'd they call her in high school?
You knew the place --
I don't know.
The hell you don't.
Hey, it's... been two years --
Hell. Ten?
What?
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
...never... tried...
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
Six men means six guns.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Take 'em.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I can't go back to Vegas...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
We're aware of your position.
Mr. Bangs.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Hell yeah. You work here long?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
What about the money?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You knew there were guns in here!
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Haven't thought about it.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Not yet.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Yeah.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Just a roach, Zook.
Rudy, don't move --
Ash... Ashley...
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
And you set me up.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
POP! That was My card!
I'm ninety-two years old --
Start talkin
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Yes.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Where was she from, Compton?
The motherfucker killed Vic.
We can work this out, can't we?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
Pam Grier.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
How can you tell?
What about?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Didja use the commode story?
But what is this?
What for?
Mr. Brown?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Wong?
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
What's that?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Give me my book.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
He don't believe in it.
Nope.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
So, talk.
What's this guy's problem?
For what, the cops?
You didn't ask.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
It's not good...
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
I don't believe in it.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
You really think we were set up?
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Want a smoke?
What's wrong with it?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
I got the diamonds.
Where? Are they out in the car?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
So, is he dead or what?
He ain't dead.
We can't take him to a hospital.
I don't know anybody.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Maybe he did.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Look of things, she doesn't.
It doesn't matter who they are.
This must have been in the family a long time.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
You can't leave us here.
And this is Helen Carter.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
But you eat, don't you?
Where do you keep the can opener?
Yeah.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Thanks.
I'll make the soap myself.
Will she be dark or fair?
He knows his alphabet.
Don't you trust me?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Thanks for taking over.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
I can't --
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
At the ranch maybe?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Where'd they go?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Finished, son?
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Is that the only reason you came back?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
Yeah, how did you know?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Go away -- please.
I like it.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
There aren't any women here.
Suppose I take a look.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
You're not giving up?
What for?
Would you like to learn them?
Maybe I could start you out.
Gee, I can't.
Then I know my alphabet.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
Oh, sure.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Goodnight.
Do I know you?
That's it.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
My favorite memory was when we --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Ouch!!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Cindy, what's going on?
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Hi Buddy.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Buddy...
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Feel that?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
What should we get?
I don't care. You pick.
But he'll kill her!
It's okay.
Oh, right.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
What are we gonna do?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Gear. You know, clothing.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Got a problem with that?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Here you go, Professor.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
In about fifteen minutes.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
I can do it myself.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
That's right.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Yours, or the turkeys?
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
What?
Father, I think you should rest.
Yo son, check this out.
I woke up naked, too.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Oh, boy! 
What happened?
Mother? 
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Hi!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
No comment!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Because it's the rules!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
CHIP!!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
He goes to college with me!
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Goodnight, honey.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
We can be real quiet...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Objection! Argumentative!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
No, I don't.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Marvin A. Pickles.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Man, that one made me puke!
What is it, Betty?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Sure I do.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Where?
I don't like this.
Which room is it?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
I'll give you a check.
I haven't got that much in cash.
How much have you got?
But tell me --
How's Miss Jacqueline?
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
She's a pretty good sort.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
And that was all?
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
I'd like that.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Who the devil is he?
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Do you think he knows about this?
Could you find him?
What's that?
Who are you?
No!
Why wait?
I don't know.
You'll be all right?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
And you knew he'd be here.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
But it's a small room, Jason.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And you believe that?
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Uhhuh.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Tell me what?
What?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Unless what?
Is it about Jacqueline?
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I didn't know.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
I don't believe it.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
Yes?
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
Yes?
Have you ever been on television?
Television?
No. Why?
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Well...
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
...free-lance. You know.
Nine years?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Why'd you drop out?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Would you mind?
You're what?
So you don't believe in therapy?
Hi!
What are these?
Videotapes.
Who's Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
You went out with her?
Can we look at one?
Why not?
And they just answer them?
I'm sorry this came up.
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you want to make one?
It won't. Are you ready?
When we're making love?
Yes.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Yes, I have. I will.
No.
Can't.
Her name was Elizabeth.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
Interesting analogy.
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
I've told you.
Yes.
No.
But you're planning to be?
Not entirely.
I can't tell you like this.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
Why are you ashamed?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Mmmmm...
Are you having an affair?
There's nothing to know, Ann.
I'm not either!!
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
You've made your point.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
What?
Why?
I have thought about it, yes.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
What do you mean?
God, no.
No, I haven't.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
No, he left last week.
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Not really.
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I have a pretty good idea.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
What's wrong with that?
Fine.
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
What kinds of questions?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
Did he touch you?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
I feel like I do.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
You are in serious trouble.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
Who are you?
She still is.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Not exactly.
Nothing.
I just want to ask you questions.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Yes.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Whichever you prefer.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
When I was fourteen.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Not today. I've got other plans.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
You know what I mean.
Nothing wrong with trying.
Do you want me to stop calling?
What's so stupid about it?
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
No.
It won't. I trust him.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Did he put you up to this?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
God, you need help.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Answer him, goddammit!!
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
One moment.
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Anything wrong?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
I don't get it.
No? How come?
Huh?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
BREAKING OUT
A wreck.
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
Infantile regression.
I know, I know, it's just...
I've caught it once or twice.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
When do I get to see Brad?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
SPONSOR!!!
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
I don't want to get up there.

YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
He was adopted you know.
Sure thing.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
I'm sorry, Officer.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
I'm...happy.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
BRAD!
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
Flavors!
F for...
Our speciality.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
That's an extremely negative response.
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
She walks in beauty...
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Bye.
I love you.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
You okay, Miles?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Yeah, Conundrum.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
This is rose, right?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
When do we get to drink it?
We should have driven.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
So you're going to stop acting?
Uh-huh.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Sure I know Maya.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Perfect.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Beautiful.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Get the trunk.
Well, she is cute.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
So what should I wear?
Count me out.
You should call her.
What the fuck are you doing?
Does she know about Saturday?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
What's up?
Thanks.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
What's that?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
No way. No way.
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
The plan is... you go.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Yep. Quite a day.
What's wrong?
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
You broke some.
Whatever. Sorry.
Maya, how are you?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
I finished it.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Nice. Very nice.
Twelve months in oak.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Are you all right?
Hi.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Um... yeah but it's more...
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Got it.
Okay. See you around.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Oh, Maya. No.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Victoria.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
I am.
See you over there, Miles.
About four weeks.
About a year.
So what do you think?
Where's Jack?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
You talked to Wendy?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
I'm not going to curse.
Are you going to do this or what?
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
Do you think it's a possibility?
Where are you going?
They're on the roof.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Graham.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
They'll read our minds!
You said something was strange. What's strange?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
Okay.  So he was tall?
I don't think so.
And three weeks.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Gotta go.
Paden sends his best.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
I already did that.
You're not Baxter?
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
He is that.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
I understand.
It's not going to be easy.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law?
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
We didn't get that far.
Who is he?
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Who did it?
I heard that too.
Hello, Cobb.
You got a place to stay?
Luck, I guess.
This is a lot of money.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I thought we talked about that.
Nifty.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
It's the only place I'm happy.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Where's the dog now?
What is it that I can't figure?
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Okay -- for you.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
I'm glad we talked.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- What's wrong with that?
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Even the fall from the plane?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Simone does not control my destiny.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Better late than never.
You really think so?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
She said you were very beautiful.
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I just read somewhere --
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Where are you?
So you did meet her?
... so much like her?
What I do to Simone?
Simone?
Who are you really?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
How about the nudity?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Hal, what are you doing?
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
There's... a wall between you --
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
I'm sorry.
Not like this --
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
What's that?
You do?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
She still with Kent?
Not quite how I imagined it --
There was no other way.
Me too.
You know, I... don't know.
Is she here tonight?
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
How?
I read.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
I love you, Lainey.
Why didn't she thank you?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
I could get the death penalty.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Abduction?
What now, Sayer?
Is it a jamming device?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
What do you want -- ?
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
Yes.
But that's Simone's part.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Hi.
Simone, are you there?
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
I don't tell her a thing.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Words.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
Did you think the play sucked big time?
I told you what I want.
I have to.
--What?
Are you wigging out?
Really?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Don't get mad.
Yeah.
Where is she?
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
Cole, please stop.
Yes, Cole?
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
I don't know how else to look--
What--
...He doesn't get invited places.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Could take a little while, though.
What's a "little while?"
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
No shit.
Sounds familiar.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
"Peggy-Sue" --
Are you crazy?
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
Should we be doing this, dude?
"And a slash-slash there --"
He means moon shining.
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
How... was she "called?"
This is his room... isn't it?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Who? Us?!
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
What's wrong?
Getting ready.
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Listen to me --
I almost thought for a second...
Second verse!
Someone better tell Mac.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Whatcha' doin'?
What you up to?
Grant, where'd you go?
No. What?
How about Brenda?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Starla, it ain't --
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
What are you doing?!
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
You took Bill.
What the hell are we going to do?!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
All the rib eyes?
It's just a work thing.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
My present?
Okay.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
What's he get if he wins here?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Why're you driving so fast?
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
They're both a challenge.
Anything?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Hey...
Jesus!!!
You know this guy, don't you?
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Let's hit it.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
And?
Why are you stopping?
He's just exhausted.
No what?
Order up!
No.
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Bandit I, do you copy?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
What does the old Timex say?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Now what?
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Talk to me.
I'm here.
Go head on, breaker.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Have any trouble getting here?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Bandit two, you read me?
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Of course. Yes.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Mortal.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
You're sure?
And this is your car, isn't it?
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
Really?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
Are you on a land line?
I've got concerns.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
Okay.
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
I am. Yeah.
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
They what? What? No. No. Why?
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
I can't discuss --
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Yeah... Sid?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
... Jesus... what for?
Shoot.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
So how we lookin'?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
You love her?
For real?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
Why?
A Fed? Like FBI?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
Bulllllshit...
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
She'll come back.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
Probably.
Why?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Not necessarily.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Perhaps it did.
Human beings can die.
They come when you sleep.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
Just get him to stop.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
Why?
What are they?
And tonight?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Is it a planet?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What happened to us, exactly?
I like that too.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
But we fought.
You... she said I didn't love her.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Do you?
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Where did you go before?
When?
It's terrific Win.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Would you pick one out, please?
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Listen, that was my fault.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Yeah.  It was.
What's to like?
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Yeah.
I don't know you...
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
You don't want to know.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Oh God, that's great!
Are you okay?
Oh that thing in Queens.
Claire...
I don't know...
I'll miss you, Mike.
You're planning to speak?
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Nothing.
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
My ass is falling.  It is.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
She's got to identify him.
I think -- she's crazy.
It's not your taste.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Even Joey Venza?!
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
Let my kid go.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What're we having?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
How do you know where the gun is?
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Mom and I got plans.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
You stop him?
Remember Little League?
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
I know.  I've got one too.
Mm-hmm.
You get mugged or something?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Can we make it a hundred?
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Good morning, Liz.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
Does it have a human name?
Sit down and stop being such a child.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Yeah, Roz.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Yes.  Do you have a date?
The record--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
How is he?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
I will finish what I've begun
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Your dog ate it.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
So they're airing this tonight?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
You're sure you're all right.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Imagine how I feel.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl!
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Who is it?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Have a cigar.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Twenty-five.
Sefton!
Not you.
Yeah.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
What exactly is he charged with?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
What is this? This is water?
It's a mouse trap.
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
You'll fix me up!
What do those broads say?
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
I'll open mine now.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Not yet.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Anybody call?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Lay off, Sefton.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You off your rocker?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Good morning, Sefton.
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
That is my wife.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Where is he now?
This is its current position.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Commander.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
What happened to you?
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Better?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
You could say that.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Kirk here.
No.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Maybe they're not out there.
Captain, are you all right?
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Doctor Soran?
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
The Nexus.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Could it be Spock's?
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
David... Sorry I'm late.
David, I don't understand...
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Underground deposit?
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
My readings indicate great instability.
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
Logic indicates that is the case.
Not exactly.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Sir...?
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Good shooting, Scotty.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
What happened...?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
My God...
The word, sir?
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Genesis?! Whatever for?
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!

Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.

You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Then, how --
Yes...
... The needs of the few...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
What must I do?
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Share this with no one.
Sir, may I suggest --
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
500 Kellicams!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Sir, may I --
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
You amaze me, Commander.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
You're not going in there -- !
Uh -- what are they?
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
Shore leave, Admiral.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
They even killed the galley chief.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
... taking Genesis away from us...
Wait --
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
You did this -- in a day?!
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
It's a long story.
What?
I don't mean to intrude.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
The Admiral's son.
Steady on course. All systems normal.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Tactical!
Yours... is... the superior...
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
We'll be going to warp speed --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Try the emergency channels...
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
I know of your fondness for antiques.
The power of creation --
Gentlemen, this isn't --
The prefix code?
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Affirmative, Admiral.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Aye sir --
Uh oh.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
And why not?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Khan!
Reliant's command...
On screen...
Indeterminate life signs.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Aye, sir.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
Fire all phasers...!
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Certainly...
I do not understand the final question...
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Where must you go?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
Humans make illogical decisions...
Fine. Just fine.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
It'll come back to him.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
-- That's the general idea.
That's crazy!
Oh, joy.
An experimental device, doctor.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Hi... Busy?
... My shoes...
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
My name?
No, <u>my</u> name.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Status report, Admiral!
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
You mean man...
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
How soon?
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Just lucky, I guess.
Hm?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.
You want the details?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
It's true... what you said...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
But Kirk...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Where are you going?!
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
But you said toxic.
How do you know this...?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Yes?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
The tank will be finished by morning...
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
They did, Admiral.
Warp two... three...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
I have no control, sir!
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Uhura!... Where!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
No power to the bay doors.
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Professor Scott, if you'll --
Just use the keyboard...
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
Will it?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I aspire to be more than I am.
Really?
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
Sometimes I do.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
No one's ever asked me that before.
Anij!
No... I want to stay with you...
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Yes... that looks like them.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Incomplete, I might add.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You're not going to launch anything until...
It is not over.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
You're not finished here?
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
Worf, you must hurry...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Counselor?
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Come in.  Hi.
Or you could try lying down.
... I believe you...
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Absolutely.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
Are you saying they won't help us?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Is it Japanese?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Vulcan?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
Where?
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
What's still there?
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
ATR setting...
Great name. French?
Where are you from most recently?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
There is no invasion...
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Did you need something?
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
No. It's a lot further than that.
No... I'm from France.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Port battery, ready sir!
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Target locked!
Report.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Return to our own time?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
What are you suggesting?
Riker here.
Even Data?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Can you - ?
No!
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
That cunning little Vulcan...
Damned clever if you ask me...
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
We were until your torpedoes!
Stand...?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
WHAT HAPPENED?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Just the size of my head -
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Now we go to Starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
An INCIDENT?
Do we report this, sir?
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Kill him! He's the one!!
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
And your coat.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Possibly.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Kronos, sir?
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Sulu!
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
They're dying.
What the -
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
But I am not human. I am only -
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
How did you - ?
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
Any progress?
Direct hit -
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
A computer canna lie, sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
What exactly does that mean?
You are me.
No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Beverly, come in.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
And this makes you "sad"?
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Data!
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Yes.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
No.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
May I have this dance?
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How can you be certain?
This isn't real.
You're not here.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
Open a channel.
What programs were accessed?
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
New Praetor?

Just lucky, Admiral.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
We're being hailed.
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
It's working.
Strength in numbers?
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Praetor?
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Yes.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
How did you end up on Remus?
You don't trust me.
After you, Praetor.
I know.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
We are.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
You know that's not possible.
Long ago.
Not so long.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
So theyve got him up and running.
My God...
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
Intruder alert!
This is a mistake.
No -- this is wasting time.
What?!
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
What did I tell you?
What can I do for you folks?
Sure.
What do you do?
No.
No!!! No!!!
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Clarify that.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
You're not hearing me.
That's the chance we have to take.
I just retired.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
What?
Ah... no...
Steering wheel...
Pancakes.
No gas.
Go.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
I am husband?
Shit?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
No.
Money.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
I do not understand.
Yes. Day... night.
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
You want this ticket?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Can I have the gun?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
I don't understand 'friend.'
It's bad.
Yes.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
No. Get in.
Are you angry at me?
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I can't stay on this planet.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Good morning.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I will say that we can be friends.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
How long will it take you to get home?
The yellow one.
Where do you think you're going?
My grandmother's rich.
In the cars, too?!
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
Twenty-eight years.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
You saw that?
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
You talked to Iris?  When?
That's a good one, coming from you.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
Damn right.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
That's not sayin' much.
Naw.  She won't call me.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Yeah.  No, not really.
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
What stuff?
Jesus.
Where's Faith?
You just did.
So there never was a death squad.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
What clip?  What was it?
I always do.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Sleaze to peddle.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Fumitsu.
What the fuck are you doing?
Coming with you.
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Lenny, give them the tape.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
Got your ticket?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Right.  That explains it.
What is that?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Besides that.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
You're thinking...?
This isn't in our database?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
You... surprised me.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
You're a... you're sick.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
From the grave?
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
What I do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I'm hesitant to...
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Huh?, sir.
Why did you go to Chicago?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
Miss me, Dave?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Don't even go there. What's up?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
They're all criminals?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
What's up?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
Tom, you okay?
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
What happened?
No weapon.
How's the arm?
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
I want to help you.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
So you're the new meat?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Speck is dead.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You have to put things in perspective.
You've been through worse.
It didn't feel that way.
I'm sorry?
What kind of car do you drive?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Yeah.
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
I like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
I thought I was going to die.
How?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...and even then...
They're out of Glenlivet.
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Always...
The poor thing. Six years?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Could you believe it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
What do you guys do?
Huh?
You want this in black chips.
Do you have anything smaller?
Why not?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Well... This is it.
I would love to see you again sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Well, I should be getting...
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
...Six months.
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
I miss you, Mike.
...the Michelin commercial...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
So I don't call either way.
Unless she comes back first.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
I didn't want to say anything.
Why?
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
I didn't mention her once today.
I do. Good for you, man.
You want to hit the town tonight?
An eight.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Sounds more like Aids...
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Ah, there's the rub...
I just tested for one...
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
It's unbelievable.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
You miss the pain?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Pause it. 
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Are you ready to order?
I don't know...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Wake up, baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
You think they're watching?
What?!?
You gotta do it.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
That's bullshit.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...gotta...
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
Whatever.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Christy was nice...
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
No, baby. You're money.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
He drives a carriage.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
She didn't see.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
Because he's a bitch.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...double diamond...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...You're just poking at it...
Now go over there and get those digits.
...Anaheim...
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...Shut up, Sue...
It's on.
It is on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...Okay, two...
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
An eye for an eye!
Be my friend.
Godfather!
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
You look terrif on the floor!
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
And with prison record.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
But you needed a drink first.
Yes.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What was this for?
What miracles you do for strangers.
And now, what do you choose to do?
No, I wanted other things for you.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Barzini will move against you first.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
I know.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
What is it?
Give them some money and send them home.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Will you give this to him.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
I'm German-Irish.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
Who is he?
Yes.  Tell me.
Michael...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
What time do they expect us?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Michael?
I'm thinking about it.
I can't...
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Will you?
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Cut it out.
Go on Mike.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
What is it?
I do renounce him.
Do you wish to be baptized?
Just be patient.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
You think I scam?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Yeah.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
What? What?
I'll come down.
It's vile.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
You know, a primer.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I have to go to Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
No!
Freddie?
What club?
Shoes too?
I thought you'd missed the train.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Ha.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
So tell me.
How?
What?
What evening?
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Marge-maintenance.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
Far cry from New York.
I think it might hurt her to know.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Such as?
Okay.
I hope she never knows.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
So I'm learning.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
What does that mean?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
He hates being confronted.
Is he really not here?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie did it.
Very.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Why? When?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
How would you know that?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
I hope so.
So you found Peter...
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
What's funny?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Which is?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
As in the...?
Randall.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Of course. Aunt Joan.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
You're kidding.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
I can't later.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
We'll be there.
My God.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
What did he say?
He's already angry, I don't think --
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Not guilty.
Do you want me to stick around?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Hello. What are you up to?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was that Meredith?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Of course. What happened to your face?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Thank you.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
How much for everything.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
What kind of people?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Huh?
You must be rich.
You know what you remind me of?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
The singer?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
This is sort of high class...
What about the record?
Yeah.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
You forgot "sexy".
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
He's Black, OK?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
With the other hand, right?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
No, I'm serious, really...
That's fine.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
One-Ball McCall?
Why you hang around with them greasers?
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
Iris.
That's a nice name.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Do you understand why I came here?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Can I see you again?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
God, you are square.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You a narc?
Cops don't do nothin.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I sure hate to go alone...
Why should it be grounded?
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
So whatja do now?
Age?
Education?
Some. Here and there.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
Oh?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say, officer.
O.K., cowboy.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Real down.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Not really.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
I'll go.
What are you doing?
Wait.
Mason.  Mason?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Surprise, surprise.
Womack ripped it up, right?
God's speed.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
I wish you were coming with me.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
I think  it's worse  now.
... including me.  Right?  
You mean,  me?
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
I do?
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
Whoa.
What did... what did I want to be?
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
My what?
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
I see...
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes, sir.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes... yes, I do.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
I... I need a drink of water.
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No.  But...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
A super market.  Huh.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Wait'll you see the inside!
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Well...
... what?
Did I what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
A few.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Zackly.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sandra Sinclair.
Here, one of mine.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Why not?
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Not at all.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Well, that's not what they think.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
That was beautiful.
No, I...
What?
Is there a young Tim?
Found me.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
The war...
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Yes?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Yes.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I despise it.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
And what had you done?
Then why did she object to you?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
And the second?
Do you think I should go?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Mother!
Mom, they're in a cage!
Miss Daniels?
Oh, I suppose so.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
I don't know, honey.
Why are they trying to kill people?
What?
Morning.
The two kids?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Thank you.
The little Brenner girl?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
How much for the phone calls?
Shall I call the doctor?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Gulls!
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Oh. I see.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
In a bird shop.
She was selling birds.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes?
When do you think they'll come?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
What?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Not by the thousands.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Well, where did he go?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
Ahhh, but I know you.
What are you? A policeman?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
What kind of law?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Yes?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
With... with Annie, of course.
Seven o'clock then.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Famished.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Oh. That. Rome.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
What did it say?
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
Helping travelers.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Are you all right?
Are you staying?
Growing a beard...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
It was like that yesterday.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Have we still got power?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
Mitch...
Can we turn back?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
That... that... who was that?
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Yes, certainly. 
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
But can't you give me any idea?
Ask this one favor --
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
Aye.
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
I don't think I can go on, sir.
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
We can't be sure of that.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
What do you mean, Fettes?
What's that you say?
See that, Fettes?
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Are you a doctor, too?
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
I've had some experience.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
The heart pumps it.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
I have other means of sustenance.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Was the paralysis immediate?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long ago?
But can anything be done for her?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Crony indeed!
Where are they?
You're wrong.
Was that it? Well, ok.
Tell her... we'll get him.
Two down. Two to go.
You think I'm crazy.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
The strip joint?
Where is it? This place?
Where the fuck did you come from?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Fucking Zombie.
I heard you were looking for this.
Fuck. Me.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Yeah, no kidding.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
No. You don't.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
I know.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Why are there so many?
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Sweetheart...
He'll be there at 8:30.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
No -- not at all.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Yes.
Yes -- of course.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Professor Barnhardt.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Yes, I have!
He gave these to you?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
We certainly did.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
Just Klaatu.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
You know about the United Nations?
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Thank you... Have you any news?
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
Is it real?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
I don't know how to thank you.
I want to know what he told you last night.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Why not?
It must be twelve-thirty.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I -- I thought you were--
You mean he has the power of life and death?
No. That's all finished.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
No -- no, thanks.
That's right.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Can't stand light?
We don't ride with vampires.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
We were gonna grab some food.
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Hey, take it easy.
For a ride.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Leave him alone.
You can't kill me, Star.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Or a vampire.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
I thought they'd be in coffins.
What?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
David.
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
You have a T.V.?
Are we havin' fun or what?
For what.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
We're getting close...
He met a girl.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
In here?
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Max!  What's wrong?
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Star.
I guess you're new around here.
Now you and David...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
David's looking for me... I have to go.
This is kind of a cool place.
I was here first.
Nowhere.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Go away.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Mom's home?...
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What??
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Star.
Who are you calling?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Yeah.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Too damn dangerous.
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Watch Clark.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
What?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
What's happening?
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
What we going to do?!
What?
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Neither will we.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Anything?
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
When was the last time you used it?
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How many in their party?
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Four!
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
Ah... no.
And everyone looks like us?
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
What happened?
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
We need your help.
Because you'll never die.
Yes.
Send him away.
It frightens you.
This is the way in?
Vox?
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
I won't leave you like this.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I don't understand.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I'll never forget this.
What's your name?
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
What?
Why would you let me go back?
Say I just come back again?
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Why?
So you take their best...
No...
It's spectacular...
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
I -- what are you?!
You know I can't.
What?
Talk away, Professor.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Admiration?  My my.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Got here as soon as I could.
Alex, what is it?
I need... to talk to you.
Alex...?!
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
My God...
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Heavens, look at that now!
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Tonight's the night?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
For God's Sake, David --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
What is it?
I would.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
That machine --
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Good night, then.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
This is magnificent...
The mud carriers.
I can see Kalen's point.
It must have been safe.
Alexander...?
You lost someone.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
It's undamaged?
Mara -- what -- ?!
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
I see.
Imagine that.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
Yes, sir.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
My father has gone to a better place.
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I'm fine.
But... what about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
He's recovering on the third floor.
In where?
And what's that?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
My father used to talk about you.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
You done with your small talk?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
What?
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
Why?
They're not here.
What? What are you thinking?
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
How you doin'?
How?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
You were convicted of the crime.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
What case?
How'd he get it?
Why don't you help me?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
You told me this was how it happened.
I did?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
What are you talking about?
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
I'll manage.
What's this?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
You want a drink?
You like it?
This is a great song.
So you never knew your mother?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Have a good day at work today.
Hon?
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Honey?
Yes, baby?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I've been better.
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Tell us about him.
Oh shit.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
What?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Do you love me?
Not yet.
Call me back.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Hey, peaches.
Maybe.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
Okay.  I will, too.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Maybe.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Which part?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
What do you mean?
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You're not touchin' that car.
But you think he fools around.
It's probably not a good idea.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Taking a shower.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
It won't work.
I... I...
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
You mean now or before?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I can see that.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
What?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
What?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
No.
You awake?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
You know what's happened, don't you?
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Where?!
What in the hell is it?!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Where you goin'?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
You're kidding? What did they say?
I don't know about this, Dom.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Mary's a babe!
What?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
I am?
Well? What are you waiting for?
Mints?
Hm?
Huh.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
So... I see you made the news.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Stalker, huh?
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Nepal? Have you been?
I work with retards.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
Yeah.
So...
I guess.
What?
All set.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
No.
So you found Mary?
Huh?
Good good.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
What do you mean 'why'?
Do what?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Four.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
What?
Oh... Sully.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
'That right? Good for you.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
No, it's an old football injury.
The prom -- you going?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hm?
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Trying to be.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
You got what stuck?
One guess.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Oh God.
I wasn't trying --
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
See you, Warren.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes, sir.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
Good.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
What does the letter say?
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Then they should speak up.
Yes it is.
Max.
How long until the army is ready?
Still heading for Cuba.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Forget it, Scotty.
Secretary of Defense...
What about you? Where are you going?
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I see.
A murder. On the reservation.
Who are you?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
You crashed my file?
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
I got one up on ya.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
You've got no jurisdiction.
Why does he wanna see me?
What did he say?
He knows me?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
Still after Jimmy?
Crow Horse, listen --
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
You're the Indian FBI.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Ray...
Do you want a coffee?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
I beg your pardon.
Where were you?
And far too aggressive.
For what?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Harmless!
What plane.
Let's make it at eight.
It dies. We live.
That's true. What are you?
No!
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You don't have to kill it.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
Come on.
You want to go ballistic?
You always get what you want?
Where'd you get it.
...they say you're alright.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
What do you want?
What?
You don't believe that.
How do you play reality.
One more.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
I live here, remember?
Well... What   is   it?
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
What is he doing?
He better be kidding!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Is it you?
Let me do the talking.
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
Who's your pilot?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
You ever done this before?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Come on, relax...
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
That's Kazanski.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
They should have warned you about that one.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
GET LOST!
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Was going.  Now you are.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Goose is dead.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
I never heard that.
Not something they tell dependents.
What to the rebels want?
So, where to?
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
What happened to them?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Thank you.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
I'll go encode your room key.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Do you expect me to believe you?
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
What is it?
Your sexual orientation?
Amazing.  Where are we?
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Any news of Quaid?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Sit down.
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You're Kuato, right?
They found us!  Everybody out!
Rekall?
I did?
What are you, my father?
Would you please repeat the destination?
Who?
Let's do it.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
What are you doing?
--I got a trip to Mars.
Oh God, Doug.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
I'm honored.
I love you.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Mars.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
How real does it seem?
I'm not interested in that.
What's he talking about?
Blondes.
I guess he didn't.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
This is too weird.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
I think you better leave.
I'm not falling for it.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
The reactor.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
What?
You can't fight'em that way...
Cannon fuse.
Knock it off, Burt!
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
So long, cactus!
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Oh, Jesus!!
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
You are so full of shit...
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
We playing cards tonight?
Down, honey, down.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
Well, what's wrong with it?
And I appreciate it.
Twenty.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Ready?
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
He was your snitch.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
I have to talk to your brother.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
You can't remember that -- !
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
I feel much better now.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Got any booze in the house?
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
My mother find you?
Figures.
Exactly what happened then?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- How could I help you?
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
-- alleged crime --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I don't think I know that name.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
You getting this?
-- Roger --
And its purpose?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
And why was an exception made?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Albert.
What color hair will she have?
Tell me some other things about her.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
No.
I want you to kill for me.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Don't get funny with me again.
Let's ditch this place and party.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Did she have someone with her?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
You try that you little monkey.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
And no one found the ring?
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
The usual, 9:15.
I don't know what to do.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
WE got it back, that's all.
I can't help you there.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
What'll it be?
You missed somethin', Ed.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Who would do that?
But Bob isn't real.
No... No...
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
I've got to see you.
Not now.
This afternoon?
What's going on?
What the hell is wrong with you?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What?
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
Eating?
Sex?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Good night, Mom.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Fine.
Dad...
Who was that?
A friend from school.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Did you come home during the day last week?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
I always thought you knew it was me.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
What are you doing?
Who am I?
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
As if I didn't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Come back as soon as you can.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
Four cases in three years...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
You thought it was just.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
You would not...?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
No.
Through, through his book.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
I did.
No further questions.
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Yes.
I was her doctor.
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Anything special about the case?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
That's right.
Well, we...
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
The Doctors were not negligent.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I am seventy-four years old.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
And you wrote that...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Her doctors killed her.
Thank you...
You live in the neighborhood?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
What is it?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Laura.
And are they going to get it?
Do you want me to go...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
Do you think it's my fault?
Yes.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Is there going to be a later...?
No... no...
No.
I have to talk to you.
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Mr. Galvin's...
From the magazine?
This is Miss Costello...?
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
Nothing happened.
And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
...I know. I went...
...fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...I understand...
...I understand...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
It's a long road that has no turning.
Hi, Mickey...
...now who is that...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
I can't talk now.
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh. And why is that?
Should I?
Huh.
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
Is that it over there?
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
I didn't know how to stop you...!
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
The troops are certainly moving in here!
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Where are we?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
They don't do much of anything...!
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
He's very excited about it.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
I don't follow.
You get any sleep last night?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Heather?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
What?  What kind of episode?
Like what?
No.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Like what?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
What?
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Rex saved me.
Finish, please!
This is going to give you nightmares.
Tomorrow night.
And...what's the man doing?
Do you have to die to see God?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
You okay?
In what, a romantic comedy?
You're not crazy, by the way.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Freddy, for all I know.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
What are you talking about?
Heather Langenkamp?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Can I get you something to drink?
Looks like weather.
I haven't forgotten.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Fifteen.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Yeah.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
She isn't that old.
What do you mean?
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Congratulations.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Why'd you do it?
Can we talk?
Sorry to here it.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
Ya know... "It".
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
It was so real...
Who told you that?
Jesus, you never told them?
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Uh, huh.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
I don't know.
So is violating international law.
Spying?!
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
Who is it Philip?
What?!  What's happening?!!
You're officer of the watch, George.
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
And being sixteen.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
We'll think of something.
Why'd you jump?
How would you know?
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
It matters to me.
Why, man?
Well, that was neighborly.
What do you think?
About yourself?
How long you been standing there?
But, they don't speak English.
It's outta here!
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Do you have something to say?
I'm not gonna kill it.
What?
What's it going to be?
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
He climbed when he was ready.
What makes you so sure it was one?
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
For killing a dolphin.
Easy for you to say.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Sorry to hear it.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Used to.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
That is my permiso.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Why, honey?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Here she goes again...
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
What happened to him?
Actin' funny how?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
You mean like pedal pushers?
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
That don't smell like a More.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What kinda trash talk is that?
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Come look at this.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
You got me, peanut.
I do.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
What was this one?
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
You think he saw us?
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Uh huh.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Under a hundred.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You're scarin' me, baby.
You knew my daddy?
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
You upset with me?
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
They have, sugar.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
There's worse places, honey.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
And no AC.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Yeah?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You talk to 'im some?...
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Uh-huh?
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
He's the kind liked it.
How can you say that, Sailor?
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
Damn!
Mama???
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
You need to explain it.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
No... But...
Someone's gonna see us.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Life is unpredictable.
Well?...
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
He said something about being between things.
Is that just beer?
I know. He started it Fall semester.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Shit.
You stay there.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
His parents.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Is he awake?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
So whose car is it?
The hood jumper?
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
You peeked, didn't you?
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
You must be mistaken.
I passed out.
You did.
How long have you been having them?
Is that in my chart?
Vernon.
Hello?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
You're in Kinship?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
With Emily?
...reconcile with Emily.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
No! What gave you that idea?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
That's really it.
Go ahead.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Thank you.
Oh.
Want me to get that?
What'd he say?
Afraid so.
Professor Tripp?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Humboldt County?
Maybe...
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Because of my coat?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
I never said that.
Want a bite?
I eat.
I'm not going with them.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
That strikes me as odd.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
I need to talk to you.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
New?
All right. This morning --
Hm.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I heard.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
And what did you say?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I guess you have to go on faith.
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
You don't deserve me, you know.
Who's he barking at now?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
He's writing his name in water.
Who's this ?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Where's Emily, Hank?
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
A jockey? You mean, like --
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
I doubt it, darling.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
One hundred and twenty feet.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Huh?
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
Nothing.
Birds.
They're starlings.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
How does it sound?
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Don't you have friends?
What does that mean?
You don't know?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I could get a search warrant.
Yeah.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
The one with the ax?
Little Red Riding Hood.
What?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I wasn't feeling well.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
And your new apartment?
People have the right to know.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Yes.
What will happen if I do?
But will he... ?
Walter?
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
That's right.
Ev-i-dence.
You don't like coming here, do you?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How do you feel about that?
You have no feelings for your niece?
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
We have a few more minutes.
Will I ever be normal?
How do they know?
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Go home, Walter.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
What?
Why?
I don't see --
In my bed too.
But roughly, how old?
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
I'm only asking questions.
What else?
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
I'm all right.
What's weird about that?
I'm just quiet.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Doesn't it get noisy?
I like the noise.
You must hate it.
Maybe later.
How about in the morning.
The morning?
Did I say something wrong?
Is that all?
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
It's not what you think.
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
You really believe that?
You know, this is crazy.
Not ever?
I've got problems.
I don't need a plant.
I'm not scared.
You okay?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
You got it?!  You got it?
What's goin' on, Boss?
I'm taking you back out.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
No.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Alright, put this on.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
What's the plan?
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Why bring it here?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Is that it?  Is this right?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
He's convulsing!
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Cab One, radiation readings?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
4800 feet.  It's official.
What kind of light?
Would we see the flash?
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Did you sleep well?
But how could you say such a thing?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Well?
There's no comparison.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
And why do you tell us this only now?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Nothing... nothing at all!
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
It takes even less.
Any news?
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
What is it, Claudia?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Claudia, let's get married?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
That's why I asked you...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Why?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
To do what?
You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
But for what reason should I come there?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
What is it?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And what did they say about me?
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
No. The owners are in Australia.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
They didn't seem too good.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Your mother?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
You're kidding!
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
No.
I can't say.
I'm a blimp.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Why?
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Why?
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
Should you see a doctor?
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
No I don't.
I just heard you.
What would you like to talk about.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, yes!
Often?
Where do you meet?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Why should they?
Down... there.
I went to my room.
I got sicker.
Where did the baby come from?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Agnes, how are babies born?
No.
I can't have them any more.
I've stopped menstruating
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
What else did she tell you?
Like what?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?  Mmm?
Yes.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
I'm not sick.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
What did you do?
She's dead isn't she?
She can.
How?
How does she know that?
Oh, yes.
What?
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Are you pretty?
You're a mistake.
Of telling you.
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
No.
Why?
Yes.
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
And then what happened?
What is it?
Do you know who put it there?
What do you think it's there for?
Are you ill?
Of what?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Agnes, can you hear me?
How did she know about him?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him for what he did to me.
It was alive wasn't it?
You saw it all didn't you?
What did you do?
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Who are you?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Yes.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
What business is it of yours..?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
You can call me Sister.
Two packs a day.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
The science of psychiatry.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
So, someone else could have done it.
It's possible isn't it?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
She has it now.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
I'm only interested...
She is not a child.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
There's another choice.
All right, what do you need.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in January.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Nothing.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
And my permission?
Her spiritual health.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Nothing...
No, it reminds me.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Yes I do.
Become?  One is born a saint.
May I be present?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For the Church?
You think she's a saint?
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
How  ?
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Hasn't she had enough?
Who knew she was pregnant?
Did you know she was pregnant?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
You tied the cord around its neck.
We'd be thrown out.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Y'what?
I'm a deserter.
Just you?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
What about all these letters?
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Spoil sport!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Are you going in?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.
Yeah, grotesque.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
I beg your pardon?
Get him out of here!!
That's not your Grandfather.
Gerron.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
Yes.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Is she?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And what do you do about it?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Well ... what's the matter with that?
You can learn from books.
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Oh ... I dunno.
A book!
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Hello, Grandfather!
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Is that yours?
Hiding.
That little old man.
I hope he fell off.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
I'll brook no denial!
Now, look here, Norm ...
What?
Hello.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
My eyes are lighter.
And my nose...
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
I knew I could rely on you.
Well!
Don't exaggerate.
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Do I have to raise me voice?
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
He's been gone a long time.
Who?
Down the ... er ...
What is he?
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Cattle ranch!
Locked.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Is it solid?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
You want to try?
Can we come up?
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
How do you feel, Dell?
Computer, what language was that?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
Yeah!
It grows on you.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
What happened to the lights?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
What?
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Yes?
How's Broussard?
Now what's wrong?
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
Oh no.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Blow the ship up?
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
First contact...
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
That way.
It's close, real close.
Air lock?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
There, it caught!
It's stopped?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
How?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Let's hear it.
Yeah, okay. 
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
But?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
I understand why you did that.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
We won't need it then.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
Better?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Is it dead?
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Minh...
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
What's happening?
How many of them are there?
Are you alright?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
When?
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
Has anybody talked to them?
Oh, man...
Listen to what?
What?
Whoa, wait a minute...
Alright, okay.  Look...
What?
It's alright, it's cool...
What happened?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Phoebe.
I call myself Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
That's right.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Yes. The Shubert.
Eddie...
Hungry?
Just like that, eh?
Just like that.
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
All paved with diamonds and gold?
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
You have no right to say such things!
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
What do you take me for?
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
Yes, Addison.
Because I don't want to.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Let's go sit by the piano.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Then you've heard too.
We have that in common.
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Eve! My understudy...
Didn't you know?
How... how was Miss Caswell?
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Right here. A minute ago.
Good luck, genius...
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
When? When are you going to do it?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Huh?
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Many happy returns of the day...
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
She's a girl of so many interests.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Twenty minutes!
For instance what?
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
I mix what I like.
What a body, what a voice.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Here we go...
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Just wondered what?
Why what?
I don't have to. I want to.
I just asked a simple question.
Also Addison deWitt.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
From what would I be running?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
I'm for it.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
You're quite a girl.
Find out.
What did you expect - live sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
You need new girdles.
The same size?
How do you do, my dear.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Hmm?
Like an agent with one client.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
What are you doing here?
That's all.
What report? To whom?
I've heard of them.
How long does it take?
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Not just that way. As a friend...
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Mrs. Richards.
The show must go on.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
You won't forget it?
They certainly don't waste much time.
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
I'm not crying.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
I'll never get over it.
I think I know...
Something most important you can do.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Not at all...
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Hello, Miss Channing.
Really, Eve? Why?
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Do you want it on?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
What is?
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
That's quite a change of subject.
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
I'm trying hard to follow you.
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
How about calling it a night?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I'm sure.
To you, too?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
What's your being married got to do with it?
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Call, what call?
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
I just played it.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
Miss Caswell?  What?
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Promise.
Are you breaking the contract?
I said I'm a dying man!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--mine's better--
--no way--
--what do you think?--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
What's that?
See her?  Get anything?
And?--And?--
Were you eyebrow reading?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
Anything you've got.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--we will--
Goddamnit--
--shit, who do we know?--
--has he got an ax?--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
--I haven't said anything--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Nah.  Maybe.
--Jesus--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Well of course.
You can't.
I've got a lot of energy.
I didn't.
Sure--off the record.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
--so?
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hey... very tense.
Give me your checkbook then.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
So tell me about the Times article.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
What happens when the baby comes?
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
Just tell me his title.
I got Clawsen on hold--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
We can't talk inside either?
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Yes, sir.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
Go on.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Ratfucking.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
Howard Hunt here.
Security consultant.
Government. Recently retired.
Are you sure?
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
It is.
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Lotsa hints--
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
Anyone but Bernstein.
--has any of them got an ax?--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
Go on.
The what to what?
Sorry.
I'll do it.
Great evening, isn't it?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
All right, I got some scotch.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
This.  Right now.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Um...Chris --
Do I have to?
You don't like it?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
You can't sing at the competition.
You're missing the game for us?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
You called me Oz.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
But that one time --
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me!  Yes!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Fuck me!  Yes!
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Jim?
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Yes.  Seriously.
Whatever you want.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
This'll do.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
You guys got the Latin homework?
I still think you're okay.
Yes.
Well...uh...
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
No, not again.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
That's my trick!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Now?!
You comfortable?
You sure you're comfortable?
Me too.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Contact, dude.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
Okay, explain.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
NOVA!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Bullshit.  From where?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Here, babe.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Sure. I can follow that.
Salots! Shitfucker!
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Hello?
Are you okay?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
They're coming!
Are you crazy!?
What?
Whoa...
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Andy...
I don't believe we've been introduced.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Why would he pick this one?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
You fucking liar!
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Why were you so late tonight
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Hurry, Grandmama!
Where is your home, Anya?
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Did I tell you that?
No! I look ridiculous!
Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
Why do you want to go to Paris?
You never thought of the possibility?
By pulling my hair?!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
Every Russian family has one..
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Anya, wait!
Dmitri?
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Why does everyone have to act that way?
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
What?
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
You'd lose your security deposit?
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
I'm getting a chest cold..
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
What do we do now?
How is our current financial status?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
I'll show you!
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
I should go
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Can I have your autograph?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
It's okay.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
The alarm clock.
Stop it, Alvy!
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
So sorry.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
No, Chippewa Falls.
Wisconsin.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
All right.
I'll getcha a piece.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Yeah, my grammy.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
You sure?
Neat?
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Well, who's Sadie?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Oh, thank you.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
what I mean?
think that's, uh-
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
It's terrific.
Really?
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Good? I was-
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Yeah?
big subject with me, yeah.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
And blind people, crippled...
M'hm.
Look at these guys.
Oh! Italian, right?
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
You- Do you love me?
Yeah.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Don't you think I do?
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
M'hm.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
David? You call your teacher David?
It's his name.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Yeah?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Yeah.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Will it change my life?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
I'm following you and David, if you-
What?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Oooh.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Okay, let me have this.
Yeah?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Check it out.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Remember, we had that thing.
Thing?
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
God.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
God.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
You look very pretty.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
You're mad, aren't you?
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
I'm late.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Commentary.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Oh, you got a headache!
Oswald and ghosts.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
It's a narrow view.
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Oh, do yuh?
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Charlie Chaplin.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Mean?
Just give me the license, please.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Yeah, watch the road!
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
All right-so we can afford it.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Oh.
It was a wonderful set.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Did you know the contractor?
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
You're fucking desperate.
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
And you've only just met.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
No, what?
The movie.
Who, Sally?
Leo?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I'm not.
Didn't I say?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Don't you miss it?
Really.
What is that thing?
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Anymore.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
What is it?
You need to call your dad.
Leave us alone right now.
Oh.  You're them.
Excuse me?
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
There's a test, you know.
Not as a rule.
Hey!  Would you?
I don't think so.
Anytime, sport.
We closed.
I adore him.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Ryan's novel.
No luck.
Accept a compliment.
No.  Did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
In the kitchen.
Yes.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Not properly watered.
Dolphins.  Great.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Cal, too?
Anyone else?
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
It's a Calder.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Panes!  How are you?
Has she called?
Coffee?
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Yes, she is.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Not long.
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
The infamous dog?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I need to leave you now.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
Ryan's really angry with me.
I think he's really angry with me too.
I'm sorry.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
Medallions.
Yes.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
Of course it's alright.
I didn't say a word.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
How's he doing?
Well, yes, actually.
Yes.
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Ryan!
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Yes.
I...
The charades.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Yeah.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
How?
You're keeping a record, are you?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Monica and Ryan.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
She's such a great photographer.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Oh Soph...
Well good.  Thank God.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
And Cal's this massive adult?
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Tell me about it.
General -- we have to talk sometime!
Well...  I declared war!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
No...as a matter of fact...
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Water...water...
We're going to die!
Out here I'm just what?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
So what makes you so special?
Come on, Z.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Why do they have you tied up here?
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Barbatus!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
So...you two are in love?
Ask me why we're so successful.
What do you see out there?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
Not there.  Under the mat.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Why?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
Sure.
You mean tonight?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
How many of those drinks did you have?
I don't understand --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Who?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
What's her first name?
Something wrong with your legs?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
You really think so?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
There's a call for you --
Are you all right?
Thank you.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
You did?
Here.
That's terrible.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
No -- just come as you are.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
I mean, after that?
Oh.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
What for?
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
What kind of joint are you running?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Oh.
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
How do you work it with the key?
Where are you going, Baxter?
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
This?
I am?
Relax, Baxter.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Sir?
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Yeah --
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
I got kicked in the head, too.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Yes, sir.
I see.
Don't mind what?
No key!
Now you're being bright?
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Me?
What are you going to do, Doc?
Want to tell me what happened?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Any of that coffee left?
How's the patient?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Kubelik.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Well -- thank you.
That's right.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
It's been hell.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Remember what we talked about?
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Now, Fran --
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
All set for what?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
The nerve.
I told you -- with my mother.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Go where?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
See if they'll what?
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
We've been attacked.
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby what?
How about a drink ?
Winning the war by yourself.
None.
Were you Longe Range Recon --
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Sometimes.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Holy shit.
Chef.
Yes, sir --
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
No shit.
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
What do you see?
And the grass?
Charlie?
Looks that way.
What are we doing here?
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
What'd he say?
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Who knows what's up there?
Get in there !
What the hell is it?
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Signs?
Listen.
Anybody see some smoke ?
I never heard about that.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Terminate ?
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Spooky.
Charlie?
How did they know?
I thought he was a lame.
A lame ?
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
But why ?
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Captain?
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
No. Walked.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
I met him.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
Who?
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
I'm Kurtz.
You were not coming here, to see me?
You've gone crazy.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
How did we get here?
Fuck no.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
He'll kill us.
Are you finished surfing?
Yeah... thanks.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
What?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Why didn't he shoot you?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Yes.
What did you hear?
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Beverly Hills --
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
134  CONTINUED:
113  CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!
Oh.
What happened here?
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Thanks.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Be careful, okay?
What's going on?
Where's Corbett?
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
Leave it here.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Desmond.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
If Corbett's men find out --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
What's wrong?
What are you talking about?
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Alleged killer.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Why the smirk?
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Get the fuck out of here.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
Huh?
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Do you love me?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
How long has he been having problems?
Have they done blood tests on him?
Emergency room only.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Me. My home number is on this card.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
I see the help -- judgement call.
No.
Spencer.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Nice of you... thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
You take off when you have to.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Is there another way to see it?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
And mean it...
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
It's one idea...
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll never forget you said it.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
That seems like a good choice.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Go ahead.
Grouchy?
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
You know what? I...
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Good night.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
No. No. Get Carol.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
She's nice.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
No. Please, don't force him.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Yeeeess!!!
Did you... do something to him?
Where are all your queer party friends?
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, sweetheart...
Thanks.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Did you like it that much?
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
What's it mean?
How do you write women so well?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Why are you doing this?
What are you doing?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
You can't --
No fucking way.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
You would be.
Game over, bitch!
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Who is the mark?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Is this how it went, Nick?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
An assassin?
What does that mean?
So this is something between you and him?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Because he is trying to retire me.
Yes.
Why?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Right.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Had?
I killed him.
How old were you?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Jesus -- why?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Yes.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Where is it?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
Here?
Breakfast.
How was the beach?
Transmits and receives.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
What did he want?
No.
They're worth less points.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Why?  I don't know.
Attraction is a complication?
Who was she?
What happened to her?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
I'm taking off my mike.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Some.
Anything.
You mean quit?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
But we are underground?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
And put it on expenses?
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I'm an idiot?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
I've been saying that since we met.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
I'd love to get in there.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
I thought you were gonna throw these?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Nope.
Like helping a sick kid?
Close!
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Red or white?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
What happened to Katka?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
He got that one right.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
WE gotta think of something.
It's...42 56 76 .
Some deal you did there!
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
You don't understand, I can't!
What?
No!
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
That one?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
No!
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Forget about me Kat.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Okay?
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
No, it should be over soon.
I thought I'd help out.
We don't need you.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
What's the Bugler?
A champion of lost causes huh?
Shall I wash these out?
Is it dry?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Uh-huh!
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Yeah!
No, just a drill.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Yeah.
No problem, is it at your place?
That's my bag.
Shall I look after the rest?
You are responsible...What has happened?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
So go dance.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
What if they expel you?
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
I don't want his money.
You saw him?
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
Were you with Jamie?
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Don't call him a dipshit.
You do --
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
I'm very sorry --
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
-- This your idea of small talk?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
I don't want to have any conversation.
Like me.
What the -- ?!
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
I'll take a chance.
Like you'd know.
You think so.
Saturn. Beautiful.
The dirty snowball at its core.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
It's not.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
And why would that scare me?
Your turn.
Excuse me?
I don't understand...
You make me feel...
What's wr--?
Where?
When did you build this?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Are you trying to seduce me?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
No.
Pull over.
Help me live until I die?
Now? We just --
Lower. Same page.
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
How're you doing?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
You're in the play?
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
Like what, sir?
Landon. You go on home.
Yes.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
I'm no dummy.
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
This... is the number one single?
Uh, yes, sir...
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Fine.
Hi, Marty.
What time does school start around here?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Eileen, Chinese food again?
What drill?
Oh yeah.
The sunrise? What for?
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Huh?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
'Bike fine point?'
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Why?
You mean, you're gonna --
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Operator, what's today's date?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Oh, right, right... 
Then where the hell is he?
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
A gold mine?
Marty, that would alter history.
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
How did you know?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
You answered the door!
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I know.
Where did you get this?
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
There's no way of knowing.
You didn't?
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Pretty, isn't it?
What? 
Hi, Marty!
Gone?... Where?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Okay.
What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Does he bite?
Thirty aught six.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
You like people?
I mean it.
Hi.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
You love him?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
What for?
Doing what?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Spanish.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
My stomach's growling.
I don't care.
What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
But it would hurt.
Don't call me stupid.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
I don't know.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Don't.
I'd like to get out of here.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
What's that?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
This your place?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Hold it right there.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
What crate?
Arachtoid.
Not really.  This is pretty important.
What is it, Tommy?
Dead.  Damnit!
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
And they got Penny!  Look!
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Who?
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
How did she die?  I wanna know.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
It's too dangerous.
Stay here, I'll be back.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Pick those up, Reno.
Pictures don't lie.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
Why me?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Let him go.
Hello.
Before what?
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Hah!
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
Chet!
...Who?
What DID you mean?
Ever talk to him?
What else?
It's still a little early for me.
I'm a writer. Ted O 
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
To do what?
To see pap.
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
And I could tell you some stories 
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...What's the expression  me myself and I.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time 
Hi, Charlie.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
...Your room does that too?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Barton. Are you all right?
Hold on 
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
What do you think happened?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
It's okay... It's okay...
Sure, Charlie.
It's more than I've got.
You'll be back?
...Yes, thank you.
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Transient or resident?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Excellent picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
Did you find out about her parents?
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
How about the booze?
It's been three months.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
What are you doing here?
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
You did it for me.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What is this interest you've got in her?
What do you want, Nick?
What did she tell me, Beth?
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
I had him in two classes.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
You should do something about this lock.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Were you with him last night?
Yes.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Yes, you do.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I told you -- I quit.
Because you didn't love him --
I'm tired.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
How exactly did you hear?
I like you.
Do you?
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
You can make a mistake.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Aren't you going to thank me?
Fine.  How's your back?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
You won't believe me.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
When?
About three months before I met you.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
No.
What are you researching?
Somebody has to die.
Why?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
It teaches you to lie.
How's that?
Routine.
What kind of talk?
Thanks.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
What you doin', son?
What are you doing here, Pop?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I don't think it's funny.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
Why the hell not?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
I don't believe it.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
If she's telling  you the truth.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
Homicide.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Why do you think he's dead?
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
The whole thing  painting.
Saddle River, New York!
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Annina Nosei.
These are great.
Aren't they?
How much for these five?
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Decipher?
What are they?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
A primate?
Who said that?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Really?
Yeah.
Paint it out.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
I don't really have any problems.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Drugs??!
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Do you know what he's saying?
What who's saying?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
I hadn't thought about it.
You mean babies with you?
What's that?
That is amazing. What year is it?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
Is that the best quality you have?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
What's your name, man?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
You see? You have someone to live for.
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So keep painting.
So what?
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
I didn't know.
OK! Goodbye!
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Uh-oh!
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
I will relay the message.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Pouring myself into my work.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
No.  No glass on the inside.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
It's good to see you.
What seems to be the problem?
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
Keep it.
Hey, what's your problem?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
What are you talking about?
We gotta get those locks changed.
I see you knew him.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
What happened to his wife?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Like hell you do.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
Impressive
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
Then you never loved me?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
It'll never work.
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
What did you say?
The _Rolls_?
Why, indeed?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Perhaps the fall...
Recognition, of course.
Letters in the alphabet.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
And another name for Mystery?
Enigma.
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
How ya doin', Al?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
We all wear masks.
My life's an open book. You read?
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Mr...?
So glad you could come.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
La'chiem.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Excuse me.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
...Not the bat?
Okay. I'm outta here.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
Bruce, you can't.
Chase?
Who is it?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
_We_ sure are.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
A man with a death wish.
B-12.
How high up would you say that is?
Yes?
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
GET IN THE CAR!!
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Great.  Give me a grant.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
As far as I know.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
I'll take you home if you'd like.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
Keep her on the line!
What now?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
I've considered that possibility.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Where does one man get all this junk?
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
What were you thinking?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Alexander... I know you.
HOLY SHIT!!
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Do we know anything about him?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Go ahead.
There were three strawberries.
Hi,
Sort of half.....
Meaning?
Annie, it's me.
Goodnight Annie.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ahm.....
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
She's ... well, she's good.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Say that again, son.
I beg your pardon?
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
You're not going to ....
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Sure did.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Doctor Jacobson?
Why thank you sir.
I am sorry you feel that way.
What's gone?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
What a dork. Huh huh.
No it wasn't!
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Uh, you first.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Uh... bye-bye.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
They perk me right up.
Ah, the witness?
Cavity search...?
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
D.C., Chief.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Do her? Huh huh.
Really? That's where we're from.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Who sent ya?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Anything happen while I was away?
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Won't?  Or can't?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
My God, we're back where we started.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Here's something.
She's only fourteen...
Honey.  Let's go.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
And your sushi was remarkable.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Aren't you scared?
What?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
What is going on?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Aren't you dead?
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
How'd you do on the science test?
I think so.
I... I don't know what your name is.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
You've got to help them.
... I will.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Stepmother's...
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
What do you think?
Viridian?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Is there much more of this torture?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
They don't want to come down.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. I think so, too.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
... And please call me Robert.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Were you going somewhere?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
I would like to watch television.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
What is that?
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Can you see well?
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Ben is very ill.
Yes, I understand.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
A flower...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
I can't read.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Good morning, Louise.
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
Yes.
You're welcome.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Have you served in the Army?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
You heard?
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
And look who you brought with!
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
I can certainly understand that...
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
Good night.
Look, Johanna...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
... Well?
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Oh yeah, he's good.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Enjoy.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
We have to make it an early night.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
I was worried.
The ferret?
Yeah. You want a beer?
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
How was it?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
No they're not.
What about Maxine?
Yes.
We?
Tell her you need to see her.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
What's that?
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
That... was... no... simulation.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
My name is Schwartz.
Security.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Dr. Lester...
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Yes, well...
Who told you?
Who told you?
Just.
You married?
What'll you have?
The usual, Barry.
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Tickets to Malkovich?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
You're evil, Maxine.
Lotte, this is so good...
Let him try.
Hello. Wendy.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
You can be John Malkovich.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Forget it.
Fork ah did?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Says me. Do you dream often?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Anybody else?
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I have to see you.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
No.
How'd you get this number?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Stay in him forever?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
Captain Mertin?
There ain't.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You don't sit with me!!
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You on your way home?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Well, if you want my opinion...
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am..
I want to work, Miss Lady.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
The church!
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Aw, no, Ella.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
For what?
Never found out.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
You don't know what I think.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
She was only-
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Sethe?
You got to get up from here, girl.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Make it the way I always do.
Hey!!
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
This is our concern, Dude.
The Gundersons.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Come and get it.
Nothing.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
What's this?
I'm going home, Donny.
Almost five!
What tied the room together, Dude?
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I was bowling--
What's a pederast, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Nancy's pretty good.
Are these.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
No, they--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
And was there anything of value in the car?
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Is that what that's a picture of?
Oh yeah?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
You're not interested in sex?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Well--sure, I could do that--
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
And please don't call her my mother.
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Delayed after-eff--
Uh-huh.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Finder's fee?
I want a child.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This was, uh--
What the fuck are you--
Yeah, but--
Huh?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
No, you're not wrong--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Huh?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
The what?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
That wasn't her toe.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
What about the toe?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
It is a fucking emergency.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Yeah?
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well can we--
Dude, I'm sorry--
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
Yeah.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Huh?
Well we--I don't--
Who the hell is he?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
I'm not--
Whatta we do about the Mex?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
What?
Why?
You're hurting me.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
What do you think?
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
He was here.  Watching us.
Nomak?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
From his father, of course.
We're locked in.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Tell me something, Skid --
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Pretty.
Stupidity.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Maybe I don't see it that way.
No longer.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
Hold out your hands.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
You used me as bait?!
But, he could've --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
What is this place?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Are you all right?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
-- tearing me -- apart.
No --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
You don't have to be.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
How many of you are there?
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
LaMagra --
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
Blade --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
We keep in radio contact.
Whistler!
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Why do you hunt them?
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
--and if she ever did--
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Not that I can see.
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Why?
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
What's she look like?
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Oh, sorry, right.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
So says her website.
--<u>myth</u>--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Anna--
You said the name "James."
Baby names?
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
I think we get the gist.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
Are you marked like this??
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
Yeah.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
You want a hand?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
This is a little nuts.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
So lemme see it.
Never would've guessed.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
We should be so lucky.
Too busy eating us?
Where <u>is</u> it?
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Cotter?
Where?
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--I saw what I saw.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--turn the camera off--
--Cotter--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Enough to keep sane.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Pointless.
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Cotter'll kill you.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Finally got her back to sleep.
--I know!
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--yes--
Who <u>is</u> this??
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Yeah.
...Drive me to a motel?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Where... where you going?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Well I'll be damned.
Yeah? What happened?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Ray--
...So?
So how long have you know Meurice?
...So what're you doing tonight?
We don't seem to be communicating--
Christ, I'm getting bored.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
...You know that car?
No.
...What was that back there?
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
You want me to kill 'em.
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
How would I know?
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What's this?
Thanks Meurice.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
What day is it today, Angie?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
I've seen a few.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
Yes.
Why do you do it?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Yes, but.
Can I feel 'em?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Bull.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
That oughta do it.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
THEN WHAT?
Do you like that?
Nothing. Are you alright?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Yes, I like you.
Frank? .can you stand up?
No.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Come in.
It used to make me laugh .but.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Are you a bad boy?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
I'm glad you do.
I'll call you.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Shh. I'll tell you.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
What else is new?. right?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I'm here, aren't I?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Are you alright?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
Okay. thanks.
What did you see?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay. be careful.
Goodnight.
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Yeah.
Everything okay?
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay.
Where to?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Really?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Dorothy Vallens?
Go ahead.
Hi Dad.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
On the plane.
Motherfucker works fast.
No honey, I'm alright.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
What is?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Tuna, this is crap.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What can I do for you guys?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
And I only deal with you?
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
You?
For calling you a homo.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
How are we doing?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
What's the matter, George?
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
We're half a million off.
There's no room.
Are you comfortable with this?
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
Barbara.
G-d, son.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Who's the cheapskate?
Yes, it is.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Freedom.
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
George, you look terrible.
Yeah.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
No.
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Hello.
Why are you smiling?
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah.
Kristina's fine.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
How are you doing?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
You mean, like a trip?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
Yeah.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
You swear?
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
It's not enough.
No shit, Kevin?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
And you believe the NLF?
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Sail.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ...
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
But I haven't shot him.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
Where were we?
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
How you doin' Mister D?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Take some time off.
You did a good job, Charlie.
So she knew about his heart?
What about the will?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
What did they argue about?
No -- never.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
I've got work to do.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I have.
No.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Tell the court about that, please.
Yes.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
We were lovers.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Yes.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
We stopped seeing each other.
What kind of information?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
You'll be sorry?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
That's enough.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Oriental medicine.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
October twenty-seventh.
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
No.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What did he say?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What happened?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Who told you that?
Yes.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Then you would have gotten your money?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Yes.
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
No pain, no gain?
What do you think?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Really?
Yes -- it would be nice.
You and me -- making love.
What?
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
If you want me to.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
What's she like?
I'll talk to him later.
Why don't you talk to him now?
What's wrong?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
Not even if they're a dork?
Yes.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
It's not that long.
Well, I can help.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Mom's orders.
Lawyer here?
Yeah.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Grateful!?
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
I never knew that.
Was this during Betty?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
She's changed.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Roseman Bridge?
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
No, really?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
So, how long you've been living here?
Oh there you are.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Mind if I smoke?
And how long are you here for?
Oh. How old?
No, your kids.
He's very... clean.
Help cook?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
You sound like an artist.
Why did you stop?
I'm sorry. That was...
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
You must get lonely at times.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
My mistake. I apologize.
Am I interrupting anything?
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
You want to eat something?
Are you hungry?
What?
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why?
Trouble. Why?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I had a temper.
Sleep all right?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
STOP IT!
For who?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
What about us? What about me?
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
I can't sleep.
What's her name?
What's she like?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Yeah?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
You want us to move in here?
Shit.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
I said, no thanks.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
The dead get out?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
And you believe her?
Cinn?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
I can't find you.
We gotta jump!
What are we doing down here?
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Did you do it?
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
Nice rack.  How old is --
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
Shit, that was fast.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Yeah, you heard of him?
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Evidence of what?
Where is it?
Where's what?
The next one blows off your dick.
Caesar?  What is this?
No!
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
No!  They're still on their way.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
The money?  The money's gone.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
But it could be anywhere.
I need you ...
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
It's not here, Caesar.
What are you doing?
Stupid cunt!
Yes, I understand.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
No.
Why?
Yeah?
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Is that the money?
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
This is a beautiful place.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
I guessed you were straight black.
A favor?
You're doing everything yourself?
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Why?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
You have to ask?
Five years is a long time.
What?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Is that what her daddy tells her?
I don't.
What you heard wasn't sex.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
He was in love with you, right?
Mickey?
For what?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
How much money?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Yeah.
What?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
An accident.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I won't.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Johnnie, what did I say?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Yes.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
I won't ask again.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
I know you've been trying to kill me.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
I don't know.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Paris?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
You are a friend of his?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Oh, Jesus... 
It's a little late for that.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Jesus...
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
-- you could put it together --
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Thanks for the ride.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He came to kill us.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
I trusted you.
I didn't know this would happen.
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
I don't know. 
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
You could do that?
And that's it?
This your store?
Wait a minute --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
That's the only angle.
Sir...
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
Tell him we're busy.
... And then some.
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
What have you got there?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
...Yer nostril?
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Help me!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
SAM! What a surprise!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Christ! You do know it all!
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
So how ...?
What's she done?
Very smart.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
They weren't at school with us.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Shut up!
Bastard!!!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Yes.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
You think these are tits don't you?
Are you alright?
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you? Let go!
No.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I didn't like it.
Where are you taking me?
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Suit me?
We've got both.
Well, all wars do -
Look at that - right on time.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Every day?
You're joking.
Oh God! What have we done?
Are you still following me?
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
I'm going to open it!
What?
Damn! Blast!
I know that.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You want to take my console into your office?
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
What have you done with his body?
Uh ...
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
This is an emergency!
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Put the phone down and your hands up.
My I.D. cards.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
What is it?
Ha!!
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
What if there is no tomorrow?
Pregnant.
Frank Pierce.
Sleeping in the back.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
I should be going. I just quit.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I guess I'll be going.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
No. He's dead.
You're not going to die.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
Yes?
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
Sleeping.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
I think I'd remember that.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
This is not a good time.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Three legs.
Backup?
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Last show of the night.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
He was tough. You did all you could.
Would you like to come in?
These are hard times, Tom.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
The brakes are shot.
Mr. Oh.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
What do you want to break?
Okay, whatta I do?
I'm not hungry.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
Faster! God!
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Stomach again.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Keep it to yourself.
Yes.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
No.  No.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Which would you prefer?
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
A half hour in the lobby.
Why do you say that?
Okay.  Let's do me.
Sure.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Watch? --
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Did you bring your grey suit?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
No.
No.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I'm not kidding.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Don't go.
This is important to me.
Don't say anything about anything.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Ready.
Okay.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Stop it.
Outside?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
The cost-efficient reporter.
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Yes.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
He said something about...
No...no.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Yes.  How do you know?
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
No.  Not even you.
Why so glum?
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I trust you.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
Uh-huh.
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Uh-huh.
Who?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
You okay?
Because you're nuts.
Where are you?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Well, when?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I know.  I taped it.
Yes.
No.  Did he really?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Are you okay?
Uh-huh.
Would you like to do me?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Tonight.
What, right now?
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
You really like it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
More champagne, your majesty?
Nice night out...
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Walter...stay away from me!
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Hi Walter...
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Yeah.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Well...
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Hiya Carla.
It's hot in here...
You better hold off on the bubbly.
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
You are?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Are you done with these?
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Maxwell.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I thought you didn't respect money!
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Gee.  Thanks.
Oh, OK.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
What's all the noise in here!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
I... feel.... pretty.
I'm hungry.
Dying.
He doesn't look fifty.
Something like that.
It's the news, Buffy.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
You weren't home.  Like always.
You left me a message?
Is that your car?
How are you doing?
Yeah.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I didn't expect to see you.
Why'd you come back?
Thanks.
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
What are you talking about?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?
I was a slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
Ow.
None of your business.  God.
All right.  What do we do now?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Oh, him.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Here?
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
What!?!
Fine.
Buffy...
Five?
Five.
Not if you're careful.
It isn't important.
As for example, what?
All right.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
I don't get it.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Pike.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
I haven't seen him tonight.
What's happening?  What do you want?
My parents have money...
I don't understand.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Got that.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
You're kidding.
I never thought of that.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Smell of booze much.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
What are you talking about?
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You can learn to like it.
God, I never thought of that.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
How ya like that?
Death is like spring training?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Nuke?!
Just till I lose.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
You can't seduce me.
What a nasty thing to say.
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
I think you're real cute.
--but you're father's in there!
Neither will I.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
You should be at the game.
I'm Crash Davis.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Your place or mine?
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
He won't make love to me anymore.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I don't know if I'd go that far.
No.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
God bless you.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
You a God damn witch?
I got him on the knee!
You missed him!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
I didn't spit on you!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
What do I got?
You been in the Majors?
Go for it.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
You're a great catcher.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
What?
Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Don't try me.
We'll pray anyway.
No.
Can I give you my testimony?
Well tell 'em, honey.
Struck out eighteen...
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Who ain't?
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
What?
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
That's right.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Liar.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
What do you propose?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Hello.
She's not here, Sam.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
702 472 1862.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Yeah.
You mean, I have your permission?
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
All right, Ace?
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
You should say so.
Just say so.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Yeah.
Meet me at three.
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
And what'd she want?
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Well...
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
I'll come by.
You go and put your things away.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Ace, listen to me.
I...
...and she doesn't always -
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
It's always been our policy -
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
This woman's an institution.
Sam, we got a problem.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
Okay. Just take it easy.
Right away. Okay?
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Want to go? Let's go back in.
It's chinchilla.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
I didn't take your pills.
What? What?!
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
How serious?
It's under...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
You threw it away?
I was with somebody.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Fuck you.
You fuckin' whore!
You understand? What? Let you go?
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Oh, you are...
Should I let her in like - ?
...and hypocrisy.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Yeah, okay.
All right, I will, I will.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
I really think you're -
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
You're firin' me?
Can you do it with your left hand?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Get out of here.
...I got muscled on the street.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Yes.
Hi. Good.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
I understand.
Can I go in?
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
It's instinctive, you know.
He's not here?
For what?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
It's in all the papers.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Hm.
You got a round figure on it?
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Uh-huh. Good.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
I can see that. Sure.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Thanks.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Nothin'.
Let me think about that.
Okay.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You did. You're right.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
Sure did.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, you are.
Yeah.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
Okay?
Promise?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Lester - he called you here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Hey, how you doin'? 
This is Nick.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
He's here.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Don't know.
Take it easy!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Tony.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
Denying?
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
There's a lot of people here.
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Works for me.
In women?
Guilty. I am.
What's the matter...
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
How heroic of you...
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
I'm a good mother!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Stop.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
But of course you are.
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Like you don't know...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
But I'm blind.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Maybe.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I don't see anybody in there but you.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
Who's on the phone?
You could've made me lose my call.
Theo wants to talk again.
Then whose is it?
You could've killed us.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Let's have your license, mister.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
You never miss a trick.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
I don't believe you.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Don't lay this on me!
What about the others?
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
That makes two of us.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
What's going on?
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
What did you do?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
You're all three of you in that van?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes.
Can you walk?
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Damned if I know.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
You timed that beautifully.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
What's that supposed to me?
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
I'm still okay.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Why are we stopping?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Naturally.
You won't live to see it.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Some loyalty.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
308-9962.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Seems like it.
Who am I talking to?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Yeah?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
How far off are you?
We're gonna get there first.
How do you know?
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Seems not.
Why are you picking on me for?
Who are you?
There's no lady here.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Government business?
I thought so.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
So who's he?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He's still looking, Col.
Don't be like that --
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
Someone recommend you?
Who?
Guy I work with.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
What's it to you?
No.
The accent, I suppose.
You all right?
Jesus Christ!
Piss off, Dave!
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
Yes...
What do you think?
I think you do.
Maybe.
What does that mean?
Why?
What you thinking of, hon?
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Sorry, darling.
You think that's wise?
That's a start.
When?
Don't.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
There's Dave. He knew too.
Am I becoming repetitious?
Don't ask me in.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
So I got it wrong, then.
Don't.
You gonna tell me why?
What's her?
She own you, Jimmy?
It's a secret.
Yes.
What?
You like me better like this.
Why?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
So tell me.
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Yes.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
You like me now, Jimmy?
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Love you, Dil.
Yes. Now.
Not if you go.
Promise?
Meet Col --
Please, Dil --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Tough work, that.
He's hot.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Eddie and Tinker died.
She's nobody. She likes me.
Perfect.
You may be right.
Give him a cup of tea.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
You sure?
Back in a minute, Jody
Yes.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Fuck you.
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Well, I could say the same about you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
What makes you think that?
They won't let him die.
I'm not a gambling man.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
And you know the funny thing?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
Shouldn't take it personally.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
Now put it back in.
So what's that supposed to mean?
See? I was right about you.
Don't be so sure.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Oh, yeah.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
You liked her?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
What?
Don't.
What?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Faster than cricket?
Don't run off, Jude.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
What are you talking about?
How was I leading you on?
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
You're going to look for him -- now?
Adam --
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Where's that airlines bag?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Of course there is!
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, I see.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Because they're still here.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
No.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
No.
You'd lie about anything.
Me?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Alexander.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Cutting it out.
You did.
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
What's so illogical about that?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Hm?
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Why don't you shut up!
Go on.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
You mean, you're a thief?
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
I was, too.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
But he is gone.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Oh. I guess.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
What are you doing here?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Doing what?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Hallo, Peter.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
I wasn't --
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Yes?
No -- no, I'm don't.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Do you know him?
How can you tell?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Shoot no, not after all these years.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
Not my imports.
I get the imports.
No.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
So?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I want you to head right home after school.
Hi honey.
What do you mean?
How much further?
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you sure?
Who is she Daddy?
What did you hear?
Are you sure?
Well?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Why?
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Oh nice save.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Ok.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Don't you think it's sick?
I got to get home.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
Why?
They're not picking me up until six.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Jody. Wait.
Thanks for coming back for me.
That's what he said.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Where are you going?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You ok?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Ok.
You're being unfair.
 Oh...
Where's Sam?
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
That's my business.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since today.  New policy.
Except for the fact that I need cash.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Why don't I--?
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...-tana.
...ya?
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
...truck.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
Peace.
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
I'm gonna stomp your a--
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
...all the time.
You'd better coast through...
We're clear.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.

Okay, okay! 


...work!  It's not even load-...
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...-cho and a hijack-...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
I did not steal the truck.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...

Oh, shit.
...up!
Fuck! 
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
That's right.  Now,  move!
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Come on, old Pete.
...Pete.  Come on.

Come on...
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Shut up!
 Oh...
Hey!

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
No.  Shit.

All right.
 Okay.  Okay. 
All right, let's go.

...you're dealin' with!
Taking it down the hill.
Then stay...
Come on!
Keep still.
Okay.  Okay.
No!

...did you?
...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.
I mean, if that gun was...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
Hey.   Mason.
...deal with this asshole.
 
Ow!  
They're takin' off.
Hey, hey, hey.
What?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!

Yeah.


Sometimes the prey bites back.
Go!
Stop.
Forty-five seven!
Oh, shit.
...they come!
...here comes the...
Mason.
Come on.  Come on.
What?
What?
We got-...
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
 There's gotta be...
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Look out.
Why'd you stay behind?!

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Stop limpin' around like that.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
Thank you very much.
...-tiatin'.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
No.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Oh, oh!
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.

Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
Be cool.  Be--
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
Well, well, well.
And it won't be pleasant. 

Well, that just about figures for today.
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...help you?
...take my sorry old truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
I had no idea how powerful it was.

...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
What?  Say again...
Thank you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...


And I changed the schedule.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
"I am become Death, the...
No!
No!
...about--

Is this stool taken?
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...that.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...and the government.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Went away? 
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.

Brynner.
Good to see you again, Leo.
...here!
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
...comes up that road.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.

Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.

Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
What about these two?
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
Right.  Tim Mason.
...general store.
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Is this your establishment?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
...should be right outside.
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...and unharmed, de-...


You'd never understand!
I would've in another life.

Goddamn it, Ma-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
And don't give him any ice cream...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
Uh, we both like to fish.
Video lock.
Go.
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
...tight!
What's going on, colonel?
 ...that tunnel.
Is Elvis out?
...son.
Thanks. 
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
A man named Tim Ma-...
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Tie a fly...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...back...
...without caution...
...is death.
...fishin'.

 ...or it'll ignite. 
You're the only one I can trust.
...-m-means, Mason.  
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.

Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
 ...miles. 
...-son.
Forty-seven.
Mason.  Mason!
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
Got that?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
Lying? 
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...public drunkenness....
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...side!

 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Take it easy, Jake.
A ruler?
Sir?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
Probably.
How did she get that idea?
Do you know him?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
I've got her.
She's fine.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
Haven't the faintest idea.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
You've got her? Where?
...No...
No thanks.
In the garage.
Where's that?
Could you drive me somewhere?
I'll throw that in too.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
How are you, Lou?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Summer colds are the worst.
I'd like to talk to him.
Or her name?
No. It was an accident.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
You accusing me of extortion?
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
A private investigator?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Would you like something to drink?
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
I'll stop by.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
Did you have affairs?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
No, not for that one.
How did it happen?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Over the water department, or over you?
Then it was over the water department.
Oh, yeah?
What are you thinking?
What dam?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
No.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
We got it. We got it, baby.
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
They can't be.
I'll stay.
Why?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
When was the last time?
It was in Chinatown.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
I know.
I saw him.
You didn't tell me.
Do? To who?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
Yes.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Going somewhere?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
No...
Back to Mexico.
How about a plane?
I have to go home and get my things.
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
Where'd he go yesterday?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Ida Sessions.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Yes...
Si.
What about the water?
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Sure you do.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
How did they get it away from him?
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Apple core?
Yeah?
Neither do I.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
I'm working for his daughter.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
She ran away?
Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Yes. 
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Did you ever see her again? 
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
For what?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Who?
You're still beautiful...
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Go on!
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
You know why?  She was so -
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
What's happened?
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
Is it good?
No, Mr. Kane.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
Let him finish, Charles.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
What's the matter with you?
A rooster?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
How old did you say you were?
I work at Seligman's.
Yes -
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
At night?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Don't go, Susan.
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
Get Dr. Corey.
Yes, sir. 
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Charlie -
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Why not?
What do you mean by that?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
What's wrong, Brad?
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Brad, you are drunk.
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
I know you will.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Maybe you could remember something that -
What's this?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
How did you meet him?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
She's plastered, isn't she?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
What the hell is that?
Excuse me, but...
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
I take it she likes the guy.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Dick.
He went home to change for the big date.
There's no light back there.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
You're kidding.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Am I missing something here?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
Nobody! I swear!
When did you get back?
I'm not pregnant.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
And you said yes?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Sang.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
I left like an hour ago.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Well he asked me for it!
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Yeah.
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
You open?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
What smells like shoe polish?
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Five years.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
What do you mean?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Great story, isn't it?
What about Veronica?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Blasphemy.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
Basically.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
The quest isn't going well?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Nudie booth?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
No.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
What?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Don't yell at me, pal.
See? There you go again.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
No, you're not.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I can't close the store.
An embolism in a pool.
Shut the hell up.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Balls resting on his lips.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Let me borrow your car.
I don't want to talk to you.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Get to work.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Five hundred dollars.
You're lying.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
Who eats cock?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
Around three or something.
What time did we go to the funeral?
Thirty-seven.
Leave me alone.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
How do you figure?
To talk to you.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Do you work tomorrow?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'll call you. Let you know.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
What?
Go open the video store.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
You used to go out with her?
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
She called you, didn't she?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
You're trusting.
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How do you figure?
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
And I actually date you?
Something wrong?
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Including you?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Three.
You've only had sex with three different people?
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
All right. Name it.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Why do you call him that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
You sucked that guy's dick?
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Let it go...
Something like thirty-six.
I'm going to class.
Really?  You're the best.
What did he say?
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
What the fuck did you do that for?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
What're you talking about?
Would you let me explain...
It stings a little.
I'm not out of shape!
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
No way!
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
No, I wasn't.
How long you gonna be here?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
He didn't ask me to...
Says who?
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
It can't fly in this weather.
You know how the airlines are.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Fine, I guess...
Sure you can.
There you go.
That's it, you look like a professional.
He knows it well.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
Where've you been?
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Resuscitation?
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
He can handle it.
What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Call me sentimental.
It was great.
Pull it apart!
What?
This rope is sixty years old!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Gabe!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Where's the helicopter?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Travers, you're not running things.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
I don't trust him.
You got what we need?
Good morning, Walt.
Richard Travers.
Appreciate it.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Won't you join me, sir?
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Fine, sir, fine.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
It's alright, thank you.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
I beg your pardon?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good evening, my boy.
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Keeping fit then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Oh, aye, aye.
What do I want?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
I wanna be sick.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Fine. Fine.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
You have, my son.
I've done my best, have I not?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Don't read it - sign it!
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
It's no big deal.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
You like being a lawyer?
Most of the time.
How often you go?
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Remember what you played?
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Lay it on me.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Twenty five?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
So?  It was a random thing.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Elvis?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Try?
Hi, Ma.
I've been calling and calling.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
I was just tryin' to...to...
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
...why is everything always about you...
Twenty-four minutes.
You prefer nights?
You on some kind of work plan?
It's not that kind of job.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Like what?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Max.
I think he's dead.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
Good.  Help me out here.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
What are you doing?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Music.
How?
Why?
Who's that?
I need the job.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I listen to classical.
I never learned jazz.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
What you mean, no?
Max?  What are you doing?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Show up for <u>what?</u>
Limos, huh?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
How long have you been a hit man?
No.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Who's Heller?
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
You're full of shit.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
What'd they do?
That's the reason?
What happened to you?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Slow down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
She must be some girl.
Drop me off here!
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Do you still ride?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
What's the charge?
Switch the charts.
What is?
He says a dog bit his nose.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Six months.  Eleven days.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
So why are they after you?
Equitation.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Who?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
What are you doing?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
How'd he die?
Not this again.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Realized what?
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
They're big details, Jerry.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
You look great.
What is it?
Then tell me what happened.
Love at first sight?
Blue moon...
Liza?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
I'm still listening.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Agent Lowry.
Jonas?
I want to believe you, too.
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
What do you suggest?
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
There's no plug to pull.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Yes, sir.
Dr. Arroway --
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
Peter sends his regards.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Are you threatening me?
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
You aren't staying?
Thank you?
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What...
And?
No primer.
How can that be?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Is that your official response?
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
I can't move any smaller.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
You're not real.  None of this is.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
So who -- what -- are you?
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
And in return?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
The systems integration site.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Sounds like a Russian general.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
And?
Actually --
Ellie --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
What day?
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
What...?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
What are you so afraid of?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
But --
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
Oh my God...
But --
Recommendations?
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Yeah.
What are you doin' here?
What went wrong?
No.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
That's good: he earned it.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Borrowin'.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
That's my baby.
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
We ain't goin' nowhere.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
He'll never make it.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Fear of what...
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
When are you going to call them?
Yes.  Without question.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
What Friday?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Because of your phone calls.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
How do you know that?
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Who turned off the Internet computer...
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
Who's the married man?
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Who came in after you?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
Answer it.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Absolutely.
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
Look at her legs.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Detective Niccoletti?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
Where were you?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
Where's the car?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
You haven't told me where we're going.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Can you drive?
What is it?
You're kidding.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
What's up with you?
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
And the party?
Yeah, everything's under control.
How can I help?
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
What's his name, Letty?
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I haven't had a crush since I was
Must you walk so quickly?
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Honestly, Letty.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Yeah?
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
No.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
But you're checking it out.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Enough with the abracadabra.
A small price.
No.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
A daisy for the lady.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
So there were no problems?
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Where to?
Michael.
Yeah?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
How may I help you?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
What is it? Are you OK?
I sure know what that feels like.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
I guess I should go now.
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Are you all right?
So will you?
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
I love him.
Here's the ring.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
I think I've heard this speech before.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
What are you doing?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
Oui.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
What?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Good.   I'm good.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
-- Super what?
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
But you were there?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
We can't.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
What for?
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
That moron.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
Good idea.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
Hadley --
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
Can I trust you, Sami?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Why haven't you turned us in?
What?
Maybe you should call the police.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
They were all French guys.
What'd they take?
Boy, you must be pissed.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Good song though.
The map said to go left.
What do we do?
What about transportation?
This kind.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I'm not going to leave you.
No.   How much?
Yeah, I can see that.
You lived there. You know the city.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Get in the car.
The hell it is.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
Mr. Zammito?
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
And how do we do that?
You like shoes?
Something like that.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
Frankie, I --
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
A little?
What's this?
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Who are you?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Tell me, who is your master?
I'll never live as a thief!
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Hello.  What is your name?
Put them down.
This spells trouble.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
I've missed you.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
No, really?
You say she killed a policeman?
They forced me to marry!
Where is he now?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Come and get it if you can.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
You coward!
Give me back my comb.
Let them look.
Jen...
Yes.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
No, not yet...
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
What about you?
What happened?
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
What does it say?
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
I don't know...
But the sword could be in his compound.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Don't thank me.
Fucking A, my friend.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
It's just the dope, don't worry
Who?
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
I can pick out a tune now and again.
You gotta go now, I bet.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Mom tried to cook.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
That's ancient history.
Neither.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Don't waste my time.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
That thing is poisonous.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Nothing.
You promise not to say anything?
Junior.
No.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
You did?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
Give it up.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
It was fine.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
How about tonight?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
What?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
What are you doing?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I do not.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Am I bothering you?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
That's not fair.
You really want to know?
Good for you.
I love you.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
But you knew this was important to me.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
- none taken -
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
That's great.
What are you scared of?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
That was cool.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Who is it?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Well... not exactly.
He made you give him a blow job.
That's one way of looking at it.
But I thought high school is only four years.
What are you doing?
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
It works a little.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Yes.
Yes!
She bought it.
No.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
One.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Hello.
Ronald?
What do you mean?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
I don't find this very funny,
Sounds intriguing.
Care to make a wager on that?
What are the terms?
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
You can put it anywhere.
Interesting.
No.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Have you succeeded in your task?
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
She shot you down.
Oh yes.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Some other time.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I have a flair for drama.
Well done.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Get out!
I think you have your answer.
You're too kind.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Annette! Annette!
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
It's really important.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
You're a lucky guy.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
You get your wish!
What song, dear?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Are they nice?
She was very pretty.
Irena.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
Yes, darling,
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Something's haywire,
I'm never unfair.
I thought you were with Amy.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I live right here.
I got lots of presents.
Did you mail then?
But wishes don't come true.
What do you want. Amy?
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Now Amy
And who did the voice belong to?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
I don't know yet.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
No.
Who are you?
But where do you come from?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
But we don't have any sea weed.
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
Yes, Amy.
But why?
Look at my ring.
A lady threw it to me.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
It's a pretty ring.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Mommy read it to ne.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Hurry!
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
What?
I've been working out.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
I mean where on your body?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
He's a very talented musician.
Do you really need these?
Where are all the mediums?
I think she broke the skin.
George bit you?
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
What? Why the hell did he do that?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
Okay. I guess so.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
DON'T call the police.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Peter keeps asking me out.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
Guess she never found true love.
So what do I do?
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
About Benito.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
I wish I only had your problems.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Frida? You okay?
You're kidding, really?
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
What?
You don't have to pee.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Where'd you get the bike?
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
On your desk.
Script coverage?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
You busted me.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
It's stupid.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Yeah. Maybe.
What are they for?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
You had a date with Carlton?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
No, why?
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is it that funny?
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You didn't say it.
Your breasts feel larger.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Peter I love you too but...
Be careful!
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
Worse than this?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
Here's a towel.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
You're some catch Lloyd.
He was found a few blocks away.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
The park dude was missing an arm.
You think mafia hit?
I need something to keep me awake.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Sell maps?
What of?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Good evening, sir.
Why do you want to speak to him?
Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Where are we going?
Why are they after you?
Go on.
What now?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Look!  This is a good one!
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
I didn't realise...
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
If you like.
What are you hiding?
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
You understand what you'll be doing?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
For a month.
Right and don't embellish.
Dave...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
The Washington Post.
What do you think you're doing?!
Oh... I'm fired?
Fine?
I can't believe he'd do this.
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Clean.
It's a homeless shelter.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
What's with the cameras?
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Just what you think I mean.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
They could put you in jail.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
So what do we do?
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
I'm afraid so.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
Does it make the cars any better?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Oh... Thanks.
What are they?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Oh... Hi.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
You ever use it?
`Bleed for your king.'
What's that?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
Didn't mean to bum you out.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Well...
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
What are you staring at?
You bet.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
I don't understand.
I don't mind.
Are you hungry?
I really don't have much of an appetite.
You have a lot of secrets.
It was okay?
What?
I know. I'm sorry...
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
What's wrong?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
It could be fun.
The Monroe?
We're working on it.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're all set,  sir.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What is it?
Miss Henried, I think you better...
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
What?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
What you wanna do?
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
Oh, I have no doubt.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Mary.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
So?
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Well...
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yes sir.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
What?
But...
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Hey, he's your roommate.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
What happened? Were you kicked out?
No.
It's all right, Chet.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Yes sir.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Yawp!
AHHHHHH!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Yeah.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Any group pictures in the annual?
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
What is it then?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
Yes.  But
I've found it.
Found what?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
So?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
But if he said no before then...
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
It's not going to help us!
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
Then who are you?
That's what I do.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Finnegan...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
I don't know...you got what we need?
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Joey...
I mean...where is everbody?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
Fuel up. Need fuel.
You want 'em?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Yes, Albert?
You're full of shit!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
I know! I fuckin' know!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Married?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
He's real bad, Nick.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
You talk to him?
I have to go.
But you must come in.
But I insist.
See, I'm going home.
Where is he???
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Everybody love Linda.
You mean...?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Nick, she won't say why.
Here.
You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.
Linda, what's the matter?
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
What kind of beer would you like?
No.
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
How's the trailer?
Frost.
You're going hunting?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You seem... disturbed.
We... Three bullets.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
I just wait. You know?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
So do I.
Yeah.
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
The shot?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Nick, he just came back.
Hell no!
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Promise! You gotta promise!
What do you think?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Forget Sal?
How's Linda?
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
You wanna bet?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Then lemme have 'em.
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
What's that noise?
Yeah.
You didn't get a deer?
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
It's Merle, Sal.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
That's who.
What the hell's that for?
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Up I would say... What would you say?
Down I would say... What would you say?
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Speak up.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
What's this?
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I'm wasting time.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Yes.
Does it drive itself, too?
Got it.  Ejection seat?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
See those guys?
Can I ask you something?
Why?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Yes, sir.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
Wanna try?
Wallet, cash, I.D...
How ya feeling?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
Yeah.
You could always take it off.
I'll take it.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
But I like the new one better.
Grandma, look at me!
Howdy, Hank.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Say ... about the interest ...
What Grange?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
You're not -- Dorothy.
No. She's gone.
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
No, Stone!
-- in gold.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Leave your tongue off of that!
I'm through with you.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Well, I --
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Headache -- Squire?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Yes.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You want me to go around --
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Your butter money?
Mary -- it's gone.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
I'll get the doctor.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
Worried!
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
I am going to lock him up.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
What's ailing that dog?
I dunno.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
You'll be a father any minute now.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
You mean -- a jury trial?
But meant her moving here.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
John.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
The code key, please...?
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
I'm going to count to three...
What are you doing?
...I've missed you.						*
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
'Roy'.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
Bullshit.
Is that him?
No.  I never smile any more.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
You're really crazy.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
I know I am.  I know!
Yeah.
You don't have a choice?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Right.  See you sometime.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Okay, give us the women.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
What the hell you doin' back there?
Yeah ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
I must of been outta my mind.
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Howard, give him the keys...
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
Well, they go to guard school.
You got kids?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
You like me?
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
You got Bank Americard?
What now, Sonny?
You all right?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
I'm glad it's okay.
I didn't eat any pizza.
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
It was on the TV.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Did you always call him Junior.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You stopped?  Why?
You shouldn't start now.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
They're trying to come through the door!
What?
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
I don't want him.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I said you were never a faggot.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
No!
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
You're news, Sonny ...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
This is Drake Bishop.
This is Bishop.
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Yes.
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
Hello?
Where is the money?
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
That's the rumor on the street.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
Is that the decoder?
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
How did you meet Choco?
Can you tell?
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
You were good.
How you be?
I be.  I'm living large.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Yo!
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
So?
How much?
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Don't come back, either.
Mookie.
What?
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
What can you say?
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Where did you sleep?
My name is Eddie.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Jade.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
I'm coming.
Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see you out.
Stop tripping.
Innocent!
Jade, you're late.
How many you say?
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
That's my name.
It's dug.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Can't do.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
C'mon, Sal.
Whatdafuck do you want?
No.  What are you gonna do?
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Hot.  Hot.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
How long then?
Why you gotta curse?
You talk to 'em.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Keep dreaming.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
That's the dope.
I love you, my brother.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Some are OK.
I'm listening.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
I like Mookie a lot.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Pino, relax, will ya.
Turn it off.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Too many pizzerias already there.
Then we could try something else.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Pop asked you.
No, I'm not it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Excuse me.
Depends how you define 'new'...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
You did?
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Yeah...
Would you like something to drink?
What?
Okay.
Hey look, it's our teacher.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I don't follow.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
Probably because we've never met.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Who's Principal Collins?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
H A R R Y...
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Sounds like a pirate.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
You take that back!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
I didn't know that.
Nice jugs.
Can he do that?
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
Sucks for you.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Me, me, me!
I know I did.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Ready Lloyd?
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're just jealous.
Why ith dat newth?
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
What are you doing?
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
How much homework is there?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Sure.
Okay.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Hey you two. Lights out.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Obviously.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Times two.
And...?
Oh, just like the President.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Paul!!  Paul!!
My Lord?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Man-carved steps.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Always?
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
The Water of Life.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Where?
... Many men have tried.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Uh, beg to differ.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Who are you?  What do you want?
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
The <u>women</u>?
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Goulash.
What's in the needle?
Bela, are you ready?
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Don't let me slow you down.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
I was thinking about killing myself.
Don't you have any savings?
What happened?!
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Eddie, how was I?
Last night was quite a romp.
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
These shoes are itchy.
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Ed, it was only one review.
You got the job?!!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
It takes me comfortable.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
I'm no good.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
But there's plenty of other parts.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
But you used to say --
For this one, we need $60,000.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Mr. Wood?!
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
And PERFECT.  CUT!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Yes?
Could we moovf to table?
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
Tits.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Lugosi?
OUR picture?
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Um, I guess --
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
What do you mean?
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
No! I love sex with girls.
What was that?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
The poor girl's out of a job.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Let's get married.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Why... yes.
Wow.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
What if--you're vomiting?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Ed, can I see you a second.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
This guy.
Take him off the air.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Who?
What?
You said that.
You know who we are?
Tell me.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Are the TV people with you?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
He had girlfriends!
He says --
Mom?
St. Joseph's.
What happened?
It was horrible. He called me up.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Right, yeah --
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Are you asking me?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
I batted!
Are you sure about this?
Dynamite.
So?
What are you doing?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
No. Who?
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Kinda'.
What did you do to your hair?
Where were you?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What is?!
You're in show business?
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
What?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Yeah?!
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
You watching the ballgame?
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Why me?
Yeah.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Come on, Ma.
You know what your problem is?
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Who is it?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
What...
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Good?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
Sign here, please.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Dick... Dick,..
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
I guess you know why you're here
Why are you lecturing me?
Yeah.
Uh, Jim?
Walt needs to see you.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
And when did you do it?
Exactly when?
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
More this way.
Shall we give it a name?
Still clear?
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
People can see this.
I know.
I mean at you.
Thought what?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
That obvious, huh?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You fuck for money.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Look.  I want to see you again.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
I want to know about Exley.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
So tell me about it.
Yeah, I hate them.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Dudley's guys.
Let's just kill them.
What?
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
What about him?
She's fine.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
More.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Anything?
Where are the police academy files?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
I don't own no shotguns.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
They shot him in his library.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
And?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
I... No.
No.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
And now you'll provide them.
<u>No</u>.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
No.
You're the key witness?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
Damnit...
Glasses.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
It's a simple question.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
What's that for?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Lynn Bracken.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Not good enough.
Really?  What did White say?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
When?
Right now, before I back down.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Under the house.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Where'd you hear that?
Shut up!
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Really?  How?
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
What happened?
Nothing.
I don't know what that means.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
You've got it on tape?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Who are they?
That's who they are.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Did you call anyone?
I mean did you call anyone.
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I intercepted phone calls.
How'd you have the manpower to--
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Looks like Detroit.
That is one ugly sunrise.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Fuckin-A.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
Listen--
What if--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if <u>what</u>?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Pretty fast.
Feeling lucky?
Well then who can?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Oh my God.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
With what?
Neil, thank you for your help.
That's fine.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
It's a little late for that.
What size?
I'll be right back.
Remain calm.
For that matter, I think you will too.
That's my point.
Because my life is being ruined.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
The robbery.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
Hey.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Robert--
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
I see her for business.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Well...yeah.
That's okay.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
You opened the thing?
I was missing you.
Is it over?
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
Actually, that's not true.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
When do I get to meet him?
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
How can I be sure.
Thank you.
For the last four years.
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
What makes you think it's you?
Any idea what he looks like?
Yeah?
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Bobby--
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
She can't talk to you right now.
Some of 'em.
Dad!
It's okay to use the phone.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
What?
Table 122?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Bobby--
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
They're framing me.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah?
Bobby--
Are you still in Crystal City?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
What does that have to do with you?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
The originals?
No sir.
What about the tape?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
What's your ETA?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Yes?
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Hello!  Good morning.
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
He said - be careful.
Pardon?
What's this?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
You should come into the shelter.
No.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Good.
When were you most happy?
Now.
What else?
No.
This is - what is this?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
It's so cold.
Shall we be all right?
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
A broken car?
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
What?
It's Geoffrey under this.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
I believe I'm rather late.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
I told you so.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
I don't know.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Or was it Toronto?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Ask him.
What if I told you he did this to me?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
Moose.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
I see.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
The team is in mourning, darling.
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
Oh.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Are you asleep?
How?  How can you see anything?
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Your friend?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
I've met you before.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
This is hot!
Will you come with me?
I mean home.  India.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
And what if he really is a spy?
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
He's sleeping.
A bit of one.
I was looking forward to this evening.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
How awful.  What will you do?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
Then you were married?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
The windows don't open.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
You got a better idea?
We've got to catch him in the act.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
No you can't.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
And I thought we were getting on so well.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
We going somewhere?
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
What the hell was that?
Motorcycle.
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
And good morning.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Did I hear a car?
So how long to pop the floor?
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Got it.
That's it. We're ready.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
Okay, you're a thief.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Your share.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Hmmm...44 long.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Got it.
That's where the Mask comes in.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
That was a lifetime ago.
Not for me.
Relax, don't jam it...
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
Remind me why.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
I'm waiting for the tell part.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
See you.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Jesus.
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Right.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
I can put them in a good school.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Oh, yeah?
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
So what made you think it was?
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Then I don't get anything either.
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
You wanna talk about --
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Why good?
Not in my world.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
And, what, I'm not serious?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
How dare you take that away from me.
Uh-huh.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Erin --
Erin?  What are you --
You see your office?
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
What is that?
What do you mean?
Ross.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
We'll see.
Hey -- those are my files --
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
You got more than one?
Ten?
You got a little girl?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
You're around every afternoon?
Thanks for reminding me.
What are you doing here?
Great.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
That is not what I'm --
Thinking.
You already packed up your stuff?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
No, I need my car --
I'm embarrassed.
That's okay.  I understand.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
What's going on?
I am not talking to you, bitch.
What?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
What?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Who's Baxter?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
The boy is our last hope.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
And that is why I must go.
Barks at his master.
Barks his consternation.
... Like we're being watched.
I'm looking for someone.
Yeah ...
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
Mine, mine.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
Sit down, and shut up!
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Not you?
And what are they, pray tell?
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
I take it back.
What is it?
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
What are you afraid of?
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
You mean a man you can control.
I do not!
There's something out there!
Where?
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
No lightspeed?
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
That depends.  Where are we?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Can you trust him?
You look silly.
You look great.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
No hard feelings?
I always said you were a gentleman.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
This ought to be good.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
No.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
What'd you say?
Luke!
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
What??
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
This hyperdrive had better work.
I don't believe it.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Will they die?
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Good God.
They're...pretending to dress.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Give it to me.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
You told me he was dead.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Don't lie to me.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Get this crap out of me.
She's in the green.
I'm here.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Where'd they go?
Where are they?
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Stop the damn car.
Me too?
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Yeah, kinda.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Where?
What are they?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Move aside!
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
How? Where?
In the great book.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
At your service, sir.
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
To me? But why?
Why didn't he kill us?
It is.
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You provoke me, Merlin.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I?
The oath. You didn't say--
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
No, he's working on another book.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Hi
Oh great, anything else?
What's this?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Burke.
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Phonograph.
I'm gonna miss you.
No, she was heavily sedated.
May I ask...?
Oh, I see.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
No. No rats.
Yes, I go now.
Excuse me Miss?
A man to see you.
How are you today?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Are you sure?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Please go away.
Pretty close?
Did he tell you about my party?
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I beg your pardon?
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
You could do it yourself...
Could you see her?
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Like what?
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
No
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
When can I have one?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain who?
Oh I bet he is.
I wouldn't talk.
Well you know it's okay.
You like him.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Oh my God!
Damien Karras.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
Think you can sleep?
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
I've seen it.
Another one. Had your lunch?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Where's Regan?
You speak Latin?
Ego te abslovo.
What's that?
I'm all right.
Oh really, when?
Is that too tight?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And also with you.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Amen
Amen.
Shut up!!
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
I've seen him.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
It's possible. Possible however
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
I've seen it.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Who?
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Do you have an appointment?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Are you comfortable Regan?
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
No.
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys.
You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Yeah, come on in.
Little slow tonight.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
You the magician?
Go fuck yourself.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
How we doing?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Jack.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Huh?
So we on tomorrow night?
I hate your kids, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
You got weird kids, Frank.
What d'ya got?
Only on odd days.
No, I mean it.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Terrific.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
It wasn't like that.
No?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
That's what we agreed.
I'm not unhappy.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
No.
Oh, brother.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
You recognized me.
So what do you think?
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Have some more wine, Frank.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Right.
Okay.
You leaving that on?
All night?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Doesn't it matter to you?
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
Really.
How long you been at it?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Two hours ago!
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
No. Why?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
She's a big girl.
What?
Expensive hangover.
Yeah.
He was just having fun.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I can't make the tenth.
What do you mean?
No.
You don't know?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
What?
Jack, you're on television.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Five years ago.  November.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
She asked for it.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Blanche.
Well, that's fine --
What do you mean?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
So run a little longer.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
I sing now?
What's the problem?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
What-?
What's he talking about?
What's wrong with it?
I wear a seven.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
What do you think?
They're nines.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Give me that.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
He's right.
You're kidding me.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Got another song for us?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Huh?
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Funny job.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Save it.  What's he look like?
Is that the way it is?
Huh?
He do that every year?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
How do you know?
Must've been a cheap date.
Huh?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Long story.
So, what happened?
Yeah.
What kind?
Huh?
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
What happened to the donut king?
My days are not the old days, genius.
What are they?
How do you know?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Jack.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
John.  It's good to see you.
Huh? Oh, no.
Eddie.
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
He's lying.
Drive.
Where am I?
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Or reactivated the first one.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
Thanks, Pollux.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
We need to talk.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
One last time.  It's important ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Whoever you are, don't call again.
How did he expect to do that?
I took it from my fake husband.
What more proof do you need?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
What do you mean?
Jon, what is it?
How's Loomis?
Which ear was it?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
What are you -- stupid?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
That's your name, isn't it?
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
What?
You merciless bastard!
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
I'm just having some fun.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
You'd have to start immediately.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
I'm not going anywhere.
-- what?
... That's great.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Back then -- who wasn't?
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Her assistant?
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
No...
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Hello?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Adelle?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Mr. Mintz.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
But I think I like you better this way...
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Wheres my real dad?
Do you like kids?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Big Eds.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?
Damn...
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Yeah?  What do you need?
Me?
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
How much time?!
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Why not?
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
Like the dress...?
Its lovely...
Need a nurse?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Uh huh...
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
For us, Kate.
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
...my feet are hurtin...
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
No?
Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
You mean this chocolate cake?
You want the cake!?
Say it, Jack...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Not it...?
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
Thats a big one for me, too.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Im out of the doghouse?
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
A perk for what?
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Are you okay, Jack?
You look great.
I'm sorry...
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
To Paris. Paris, France.
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jack.
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Mrs. Peterson.
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Where is he?
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Okay, Ill take them...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Last night was great...
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
I mean...
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I can't take this.
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
The shields on the station should protect us.
You got a chisel round here?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed? ... Sue?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
No more cracks about how I look.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
It's easy for you to be patient.
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
So are you!
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
Stop it.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Yes, thanks.
For science.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
That's what we're here to find out.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
You <u>were</u>?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
You said it was urgent.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
You mean <I'm> going along?
It's only for an hour --
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Difficult? He's impossible!
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
A surgeon might...
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
That's what they pay me for.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
But that isn't possible.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
You left something out.
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
What about Dr. Michaels?
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
About forty miles an hour.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
There it is!
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
You have no right to blame Duval --
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Sort of.
All in all, quite a canoe...
Any reserve air?
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
Then don't drift down further.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Can I see your license and registration please?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Unguent.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Both of these.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Officer Olson.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Uh-huh... A what?
Yah.
Can you be any more specific?
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Yah, right -
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Yah, real good.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, so we're all set.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Yah, how much money was that?
No, no, fax is -
Well, what do ya mean?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Good day, sir.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Twice.
Yah, pretty good.
lot. It's a limited -
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
We might be innarested.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Carl somethin'?
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Where is everybody?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Yah?
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
...This is a nice place.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
It's okay...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Hello?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Linda.
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
They're real good.
Not on your feet too much?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
...So?
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Oh, my.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
We're still men.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
Does this sound strange to you?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Can't you give me something?
Practicing what?
I'll expose you.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
You're kidding.
I'll take the parasites.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
How did you find me?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
It's for men.
What are you doing here?
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
I don't know ...
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Uh ... nah.
Whatever.
Do you care?
That... sawing and hammering.
What is this?  Who did this?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
He's not here.
What?
What is wrong with you?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Marla...
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
What?
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
What?
I'm sorry, but I...
Why are you doing this?
Hello?
Who's this?
How have you been?
Is this a test, sir?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
It's getting exciting now.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
And, now it's gone.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
No, I...
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Yes, you can.
What's that?
What?
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
You?
You're sure?
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Okay.
You want to finish her off?
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
No, I'm not...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
It isn't... ?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What... ?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Look...
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
This conversation...
... is over.
"Too young?"
Why do people think I'm you?
Why do people think anything?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
...to let this happen!
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Yes...
Please...
Damn it!  God-damn it...
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Why are you doing this?!
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What?
Maintenance.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Yes, it is.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Yesssss...
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Yeah, how?
Signs?
Please, what else could it mean?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Speed up.
No!  It can't be.
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
I'm not sure I understand.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
That lucky bastard.
Carter.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
You've made your point.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
You mean Alex Browning.
Stop it, don't move him!
Shouldn't we pull over?
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
Yeah?
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Is that something you're "feeling?"
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
Remember the departure time?
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
Cuticle lacerations.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
You mean the snake?
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
That's what I'm here for.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
No cigarettes.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
It's a guy in a cage.
That guy's not going to make it.
I'm getting him out.
Yes.
You comin'?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Spooks?
Are you okay?
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Thanks.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Invulnerable.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Yes you can.
John.  My name is John.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
You pathetic scum.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Typical...
What?
About 22 hours on site.
How long before you're fully on line?
I know...
Take your time.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Can you walk?
Hello, John.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
But now it's free, right?
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Meeting ... people.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I was attacked.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
He's not a moron.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Hello....congratulations.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
No.
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
Parry?
What if I was a relative?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
Tragedy?
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
How un-sixties of you.
Hello Lydia?
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well there....  What's the difference?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Please don't hurt me?
<u>What</u>!?
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
... Do you know who I am?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
Who?
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
.....What are you doing?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
You a fag too?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
Are you all right?
I don't like horror movies!
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Well, it's enough for me.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
I leave it to you.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
You said.
Now, now.
I did, didn' I, El?
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
I'm not.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm sorry.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
It brings out my eyes...
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Bobby...
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
What's your name?
Washington.
Can I get you anything else?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
You always do this to me.
No.
Robert...
I have to talk seriously with you...
Everybody still up on the Island?
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Tita, I've got to go...
It's not that bad.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
What?
With applesauce?
Why are you being so mean?
I'm talking to you, Tita!
You're leaving?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Hello...
Yes, intentionally.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Why?
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
Is that funny?
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Why?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
I don't think that's accurate...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No, don't do that...
No inner feeling.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
I'm fine.
Is he?
Catherine...
What?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
I don't think that's true.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I hope I didn't hear that.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
There's some good things on it, though.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Well, she was.
Fine.
What?
Why you have an attitude for?
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
What?
So watcha doin'?
You know somebody around here?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
So what's her name?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
I buy them flowers.
I did.
Who gives!
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Why?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
C'mon.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
Which one?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Who?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
My friend told me she lived around here.
So what do you want with her anyway?
You wanna do somethin' with me?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
God I admire you.
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
That's what he said.
Creasy, how old are you?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Ask anybody.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
So where do you know Alan from?
Two bs?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Your aunt?
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Breathe easy...
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
I think Id rather have drugs.
Affirmative.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
I guess not.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Good evening.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Right.
Check.
Has he?
Then he has.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
They bust you every week.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
So why pick me?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
A .357.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Do you have a passport?
That's right.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Only if you promise not to return me.
You doing a story on this guy?
My hero.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Preoccupied with what?
Why do you keep doing this?
I have this effect on lots of women.
You are a rich woman.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Lunch...
You were in the war?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Who.
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
What does all this mean?
But I've seen the deed.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Act natural.
What's wrong, Gail?
What is this....
I checked. There was no divorce.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
You shouldn't be here.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They just left, sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana, sir.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
What?
Where is she?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I don't know.  Look!
Who?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Gummy and two cops...
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
I want something I can print!
What...
Fletch, you want an apology?
Not really.
Jim Swarthout?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
I said, I ain't got you...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Thanks for the promotion, man.
I do it for love.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Aha, just what I suspected!
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
What an interface!
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Why are all these people after me?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
My axe!
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Who cares?  I got a case.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
You need it.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Jazz, we're talking here.
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
What about Don?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
How nice.
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
No - no.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Who knows?
Where do you want it?
Where are you?
Well try, okay?
Sal --
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Did you pick up the car?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Comment va-t-elle?
Le sommes nous?
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Sale boulot.
Il fallait le faire.
What's your story?
You're in show business.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Where's he from?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Strike out, eh?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
How'd I know he had a knife.
The greaser with the blonde.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Toy wit' this will ya.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Popeye.
What happened to you?
You want the red or the white?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Hey, Bo.
Pass.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
For garbage?
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
You're shitting me!
How do we get to the vault door?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
How about a little of the King?
Butch called.
Wish you weren't.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
Uh, huh.
How's that?
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Okay, start pedaling.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Sun spot?
Dad, you there?  You okay?
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Got it.
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
My father didn't die in a fire?
Gordo?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
You're not looking too good.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Uh, huh.
He ain't our guy, John.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
You used to be on the job?
Nah, just working the job.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
How do we do it?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I vote for me.
Barely.
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Maybe we should do some exercise.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
What's the matter?!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Which one is it?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
Come on down!
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
Why did you come back here?
What happened that night?
What d'ya got in there?
In that little thing?
Is... is everything all right?
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
I don't see anything.
What're you doing?
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Why?
Oh, jeez.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
But, Dad, we...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
What?
Uh...yes.  But...
Okay, give it back.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Lake Forest Green?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
Are they grown-ups?
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
The what?
I'm kind of busy right now...
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Look --
You need to leave.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Tell me!
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Okay.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
But she might be in trouble...
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Right.
Right.
This is Jason's fault!
Dear Christ...
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
You have no right...
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
What are you talking about?
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
So, are you having fun yet?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
What is your location?
I...I don't know...
Yes...
What about you?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
I used to drive a taxi.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Big mess every time.
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
We must abandon.
Elliot?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
We must abandon.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
It's just a review.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
What was it like?
I say we go.
I'm not ready.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
Where is it?
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
Shoot him.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
What are we talking about?
Does what feel comfortable?
You know about Adele.
What about her?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
What?
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
We're able to surprise each other.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
That's completely crazy.
Is it?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
What will we talk about?
Why won't you tell me your name?
What else?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
All right. What's been going on?
Opening night, Lillian.
Who the hell cares?
And you've been extremely patient.
That's very lovely actually.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
I am really, deeply sorry.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Washed away.
It's me. Nicky.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
You know the answer to that.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
So what are you going to do about it?
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
How come you got the kid with you?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Don't worry. It's a test.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
I was educated by nuns.
Burnt sienna.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
Oh. You know him.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I hear good things about the new play.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
What? Come on, Paisley.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Please! You're being foolish!
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
I'm sorry.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
"Hell!"
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Hm.  Is it?
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
You mean a general strike?
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
We need your help!
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
I dined at the prison.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Have you read his magazine?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
No?  What's keeping you?
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
We don't have the manpower.
What are you waiting for?
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
How often do you test, Director?
Surely you know what you have.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Six one.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
The Mission Director.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
A day or so.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
It's okay, Eugene.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
We can't stay here.
What makes them think that?
You really had other offers?
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Where are we going?
Again?
Not bad, Jerome.
In case you get back before I do.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Vincent...Vincent...
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--

These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Not that.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Yes.
Why don't we say we were together?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
They found an eyelash.
So you didn't do it after all.
What <i>is</i> this place?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
A year is a long time.
Flight got you nervous?
What are you doing?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
I'm not doing it.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You want to drive?
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Feel good?
Yeah.
It doesn't look like that.
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
How's Estelle?
Fatter... some things never change.
That's not all of it.
After four years and now the question comes up.
I'll be okay.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
Is he straight?
That doesn't hurt.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
You know how I feel?
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
What about the bank?
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
A man helped me open it...
And switched keys.
He must have.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Texas is a big state.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
That would be the first time.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We're going to make it.
I want to say something.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
No more about Beynon.
Sounds good.
You and me.
Yeah.
I don't know, airport I guess.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Can I help you?
All right. Shells?
Yeah. I got out.
What about the vault?
Wire pull over?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
He took the day off.
Which way?
You serious?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
How long have you been married?
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
How?
A couple of weeks back.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
What do you want?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
I know.
What about?
Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Jack, you're wrong.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Can I go now?
Everyhing go off all right?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
He was all right to me.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
We went about together.
Could you do me a favour?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
How'd you know where I'd be?
You sure about that?
Yeah.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Nice of you to come.
Working at Woolworths.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
You work here, Keith?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Where would I find him?
How'd you know Albert?
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
See you later.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
Will this do?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
Now just a minute...
What'll they do to him?
You're a bastard.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
Do us a favour?
They're friends of mine.
You coming back?
Is he?
Jack Carter.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Making a living.
You should have told me who you were working for.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Eh? Have a drink.
Not going, Jack?
They do that up North.
Ask me?
Knock it off, Gerald.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
What's that?
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
...Polacks...
To get on the...
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You're on this...
I, I...I...
It's not.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Eh?
Nurses.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
With River Oaks?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
That's right...
You build it!
They have...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
What?
How many leads have we got?
How do you know he'd buy them?
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
No, we're just...
As an idea.
Yes.
As a robbery.
Did you?
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
You're saying "me."
A job with Graff.
Is that what I said?
Me?
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
...I thought that we were only talking...
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
I didn't ask to be.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
You need money?  Is that the...
And why is that?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
I can't close 'em.
Huh?
Yes.  They are old.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Everything I...you know...
I am?
They stole the phones.
Were the leads...
He said we...
To the cops?
A waste of time?  Why?
No.
Why don't you think so?
Yes.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Why?
You understand?
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Would you excuse us, please...?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Would you come in here, please?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...then...
...after the thirtieth...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
I'm out.
...they kicked out.
The leads are assigned randomly...
I will close.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Alright.
Can't do it.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
What happened?
The leads are coming.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
It's not impossible.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Yes.  I hear you.
Mmm.
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
You're so full of shit.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Was it?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
What?
Only the beginning...
Abso...
The check's no good?
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.
Dave...
You sold eight Mountain View?
Eight units?
Harriett...
Like you taught me...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
What is it?
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Which...
Home cooking...
Rick...?
Mm.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I told you.
No.  She told me "right now."
We'll speak to her, Jim...
No, Jim.
What...?
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What?
And the check is...
You cashed the check?
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
Did they...
I have the stuff from last year's...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Do you like them?
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Did you see my present for you?
Will you take me?
Why do you have to go?
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Yes, thank you.
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
Is Kay coming?
No.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Not for strangers; for my country.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
He will grow strong.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
That's what I'm here for.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Why?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
That's off now.
I'm going to see my parents.
You're going to talk to him now.
Yes.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Mikey, I hoped...
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
That plane goes to Miami...
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
What's up?
No questions.
The room has a bug in it.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
You're right.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Do you gamble?
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Yes.
Kay.
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Where?
Why don't you sit down?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
Nothing is more important.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
On the phone?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
You want a war?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
What's to be jealous of?
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
Of course.  I am married still.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You and he are not doing things?
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
Nice place.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
I stink to high heaven right now.
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
What did she mean by going flooey?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
You don't say?  Which picture?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
Your family ate dripping?
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Do you mind?
I liked it.  We all did.
I don't like to talk about that.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
Can I see what you did so far?
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
What happened?
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
Who's that?
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Never gave it much thought.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
A very lucky thing indeed.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
What won't do?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Just take off the fucking mask!
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
By the way, I like the Renoir.
Thank you.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Jimmy.  How are you?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Mr. Kay, sir.
She is horrible.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Quite.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
I was going to take a swim.
You didn't?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
My monsters?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
What kind of job... ?
It seems she neglected to mention it
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
I knew you'd say that.
Sound it out for me.
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
How is he?
You'll leave -- ?
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
I know you.
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Double-meaning intended, right?
Keys were in it ...
okay ...
Yeah.
You ever feel bad about any of this?
You mean the poor --
Forget that ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
That's a good one, Donny...
Have you seen him?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Hey, Kip, what's up?
Kip -- ?
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Hey, you want something to eat ?
"About what?"
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
Hey, now -
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
"Shadow games?"
Shadow games ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
I've missed you, man ...
You boost her -- ?
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Sure, man --
What for -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
What's with the look?
"Mitch?"
On account of Mitch?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
What the hell's that -- ?
Woo-woo-wooooo!
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
What are you doing... ?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Okay, then... Otto?
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
So she flies -
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Not really --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Look at Jeannie's kid.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Tell him. It's okay.
What did you hear about that thing?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
My bag. My bag.
I'm gonna need some money.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
I can't do it anymore.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
Who's gonna do that?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Paulie was just talking about him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
It's been six months.
There are cops all over the place.
Paulie's gonna make him?
You want the melon?
I can't make any more deliveries.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
No, no. It's okay.
I hate to do dishes.
Are you okay? What happened?
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
What kind of person doesn't call?
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Oh shit.
Who's she talking to?
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
She's sharp as a marble.
What'd you get? You get leniency?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
She went to Medical school in California.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Okay.
What class?
You caught that, huh?
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
Did she get my Double Burger?
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
What'd you say about me?
How'd you like that course?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Seven.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
No, there's a limit.
Which one's your building?
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
What're those?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Of course.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
Get out, Will.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
Then don't set up any more meetings.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Hey, how you doin'?
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
I've been busy.
Since Nancy died.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
I'll be okay.
Not at all.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
I do.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Come in.
So I hear you're taking some time.
Where're you going?
Why there?
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
Who is he?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
Probably not.
What did you think?
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
285.
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
How'd it go?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
My wife's dead.
No, I don't.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
What did you think?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
What?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Gotta go with the belt there...
I know.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
I know.
I know.
Yeah, I think so.
You're Welcome, Will.
See ya.
You suck.
What?
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
No I wasn't...
Free?
You grew up around here?
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I want to meet them.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
I'm supposed to understand this.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
It's important that I learn this.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
What?
I want you to come with me.
And you're sure about that?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Will ya look at her!
How 'bout you?
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Don't hold me so tight.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Short fella. Pale face.
What's it to you?
That's not your affair. Name.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Deputy sheriffs.
Joad. Tom Joad.
Why ain't they more like it?
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Why, you're the preacher!
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
What you figger to do?
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
You're right!
What's the matter?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
What's the matter? What's happened?
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
How about a lift, mister?
Lookin' for a job?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Get to what?
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
You ain't got to get sore.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Yes, ma'am.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
What's the matter, Grampa?
California.
Got any plants?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
You promised, Tommy.
How's it feel, Tommy?
They know he got hit in the face.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Here we go!
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Now you done it! You busted it!
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Yes, sir.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
--Stop it--
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
Computer guy.
Bob...
What?
I want to be an actor.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
I just play my own collection.
Tell me about yourself.
Where have I been?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
As long as I get the laugh.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
No time.
Like love?
Not the other way around...?
No.
Jesus Christ!
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Come on.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Do you like the people you work with?
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
Like a union?
Thank you, no.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
No deal.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
--Nooo--
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
No...
That's going to cost.
They're not happy, sir.
And they want me to make up for it.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
They were very upset.
I have scruples. Next.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
That's wonderful, Mom.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
No, I don't have one.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Paul?
Debi's house.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.
What the hell happened to you?
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
This is Annie MacLean.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Doesn't matter.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
What's that to miss?
Does Chicago count?
When I was first married.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
A jogger, huh?
Enjoy the day.
The answer's no.
Thanks.
Feel good?
How long did you live here with your wife?
Five years. My son was born here.
Son?
How did you meet her?
I am comfortable.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I don't care! We'd be together.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Why don't you go lie down?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Is that your version of a pep talk?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Yeah?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
What?
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
I don't believe this!
That's not true!
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
You already did.
You got everything you need?
I'll come.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Well, one was for salad...
I'll take care of it.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
What are you talking about?
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
When? Tonight?
That's not true.
What?
Great!
Did you speak to Farlow?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
That bag's almost empty.
I'm sorry.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
Okay.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Yeah.
You've already made arrangements!?
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
She will if you think she should.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
When are you coming home?
Good night.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Yeah, what?
No. I am a "tubab."
What choice!!?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
She calls him Tommy...
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
What was it like?
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Promise?
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
What?
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
I wouldn't let happen.
What does she do?
She's an editor.
I can't...
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
"... and I said that"...
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
I can't believe it's the same horse.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
What are you looking at, young man?
Well, that'll happen.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Now that's cool.
Cool?
Secret Service!
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Shit!
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
I want it to have my children!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Who's that?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Yeah, mom?
Up all night again, huh?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
I found it! I found it!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
Think you can do better?
He's not in this class.
What?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Are you challenging me?
Your slave?
And if I win?
You're not gonna win.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
I know, I know who wrote it.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
How?
Shit!!
There they are!
Ready?
Yeah.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Hello?
Good.
You're welcome.
Colonel who?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Joey, Joey...
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Hey, it's me.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
So?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
You said the worm was untreaceable!
What number please?
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
What?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Michael Myers.
Shit!
Brady! Come with us.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
Honey, I don't think their home.
Why wasn't I notified?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Yes.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Watch it.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
What the hell did this?
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Do you love me Rachel?
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Come on Rachel.
Coming.
What are you doing out here alone?
We'll hear sirens soon.
You don't believe that do you?
That's all the windows, Dad.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
You knew. You just didn't care.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Call me.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
132 to 133 this is 134.
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
He's here, Sheriff.
Why?
Its true, Sheriff.
Something?
He's been here.
Oh Christ. Doc...
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
You're going to be late!
Saving the treats for Bob?
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
He was watching me.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
What's the pumpkin for?
Thanks.
What's this big, big news?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Get him out of here!
Yes.
You idiot!
Fantastic. Totally.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Exactly what do you need?
I found the car! He's here!
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Is Annie around?
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
What about the rest of my comic books?
What about the bogyman?
There was no one outside.
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
I saw him...
Are you sure?
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
I see.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
I love that.  That's my type.
Are you really interested?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Uh, who gets dropped first?
And then, uh, April...huh?
We're a big hit.
Wow, it's the red one?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It's French, though.  It really is.
That's disgusting!
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
What?
You're joking.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Is this your first job?
Yes.
It's really sad.
And it ruins everything else.
Mm-hm.
And it's just in one ear?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Like, uh...?
Oh, Elliot!
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Where are you headed?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Yes?
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Yeah.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Isn't that beautiful?
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.
This is not an easy situation.
No.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Great idea.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Why not?
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
No!
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Get his wine away.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Oh, Mom!
Hmm?
Me?
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
You've been with someone!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Yeah.  What?
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Yes, please.
You look so beautiful.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Do you miss Frederick?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
How are you?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
Yeah?
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Huh?
He's fine.
Ohh!
I know, I know.
...you know?  I, uh...
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Thanks, thanks.
That's a beauty!
This is the second opinion.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Uh-huh.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Don't you think she does?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Oh, Hannah!
He's such a loser!
Here.  Be careful with those.
Singing?
Really?
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Awwww...
Oh, gosh.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
You treat me like a loser.
How?
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
You're crazy!  That's not true.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Yeah.  Me, too.
I remember you.
I recall you.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
How are you?
You look wonderful.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
You have.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Right.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Just a few minutes ago.
Thanks.
Hi.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
A reward for what?
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes?
...why?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
That's right.
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
How was America?
What's up...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
...they're from Baltimore....
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, no, of course not.
...here's to child abuse!
I can make you rich.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
..suitcase...locker...
...unmarked hundreds....
Why?
Shut up, Starling...
Starling...?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Look at this:
...what'm I looking at...?
...standard issue...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
I am all attention.
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
I'm an orphan.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
Waited too long, hon...?  
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Give it up, Evelda.
Give it up.
My husband brought it to me from America.
A wonderful country...
Of course, Commendatore...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
If your duty requires it.
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
How so?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Darling...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
She my foster.
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Yes.... yes...
...who say...?
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
What is that that smells so wonderful.
...I'm sorry....?
...might I make a suggestion...?
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
You should get Married.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
...what?
No.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Why?
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Because...?
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
I know where he is.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
What shape is the scar?
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
...what a lovely perfume.
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
I know it well.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
Yes.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
Yes.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because?
...sir...?
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Mine!
Go stand by the flagpole.
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
I think your passion is terrific.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
Not now, Wendy.
What do you want me to say?
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Gee, thanks.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
All right.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
I'll think about it.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Where did you get these?
Is she dead?
Don't talk to me like that.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
S'okay....
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
And your worst enemy.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
It doesn't work on small animals!
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Kurt doesn't look too good.
Your son's dead and you love him.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
You're still not listening! I'm not..
This knife is filthy.
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
You know what I want, babe?
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
I guess.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
Who cares!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
gives her a sympathetic look.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
She's terribly hurt . . .
I think I'm dying . . .
But, we're all going to Heaven!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
The way you just looked at me...
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Well?
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
What?
Bret... what the fuck...?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I've been in here before.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
You could say that.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
That was cold...
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
In a word? Lucrative.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Never to put you in my will.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Where's my wife?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Morgue...?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Do you know where you are?
Poor Trevor.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
LaPlante!
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
It's November.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
He waited for you three hours!
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
Here.  Get off here.
Uh, no.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Vietnam!
You were... very... inspiring.
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
What's the matter?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Said he's not an actor.
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
I didn't ask him.
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
So this really does the trick, eh?
Was that your dad?
So where are all your toys?
Well, it's for a woman.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Yeah, that was easy.
Isn't that always the way?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
What happened?
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
I'm thirsty.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Did Daddy tease you?
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I've asked him what's wrong.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Here, take this out to the table.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
Whew.
Honey --
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I know it's at the high end of our range --
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
We're going to think about it.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
His secretary just confirmed.
What -- what are you doing?
Oh, honey.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
What about cable?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
It's a double.
Even cosier.
Would you?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
What do you think?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
What is it?
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
This ties in with Nash.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
A few days ago.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Central Park.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Yes -- I think it is.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Thank you, Thomas.
I'm sure they will.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
If it came down to it what would you do?
France.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
Well?
That doesn't matter.
She's a treasure she is.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
Agreed.
Your life.
Different places.
Sometimes.
I cannot stay.
Why not?
Leaving?  For how long?
Why?
Corpses?
A lucky guess.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
I don't know.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You're twenty minutes late.
I'm just trying to place you.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
So?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
I've seen it.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
And the other one -- he is like you?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
That's what the Kurgan said.
Why did you wait?
It will not end tonight.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
No.  The money, please.
I can take care of myself.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
I guess so.
You get anything on Smith?
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
What do you want to do?
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
You think we should take that chance?
The car.  All you want is the car?
I'm going to my desk.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
You won't die if you let me help.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
I'm here.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
I don't know.
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
Mine, too.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
What do you want?
Kevin left without you.
Now we can do whatever we want.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Are civilians inside?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
That's not enough.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Go, Chief.
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
You have her cell number?
What's wrong with the radio?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
He says that his father's hurt.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's right in front of us.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Where's the office?
Can you get into the office?
Can you open them?
Yes.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
These disks . . . where are they?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
We, who is we?
Paul!
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
You want to pay me?
Name a price.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Paul, you know who this is?
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Anything. Strong.
Their people?
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The high command? Our high command?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
No, sir.
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
You are a marked man.
I am on a list! What list?
You lie.
You will tell them the truth.
Business is good at the hotel?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
There are no more rooms.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Perfect timing.
You are the manager?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
What?
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
The third floor are low class rooms.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
The president has been murdered.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What about us?
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
Go out! Where?
You cannot go alone.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
In Ruhengeri?
What?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
It was substantial.
Tell me what it was.
I have to stay.
What's wrong?
Oh, my babies.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
That is why they call it coach?
The staff, the guests.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Why the hurry, Roger?
Where?
Can I help you?
I don't know.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
-- bullshit --
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Jesus H. Christ!
Oh, for chrissake --
More the merrier.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
Where is it??
This thing's going nowhere.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
-- I did: down here.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
What's in there?
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
Oh, Jesus....
-- the stained glass --
I'm better than that.
What? Deep down inside?
I don't think so...
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
We can do it...
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Or an on-line computer.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Run.
You okay?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Don't touch me!
Could we have a word?
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Where is she?
-- I pose you the same question --
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
Question answered.
Steven --
-- wit...nesses --
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
What?
Do something!
I'm ready now.
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
I think...I may have the answer.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
What is it??
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
He must've unsealed the room!
-- Eddie!!
Melissa...?
It might have been her mother.
It looks delicious...
Are you all right?
By killing them?
I don't understand.
What do these ingredients mean?
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
Where is she?
She's down.  Help her...
He's blessing the house.
Oh come on...
You didn't think much about that before.
Are you playing tricks on me?
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
What are you talking about?
A friend?
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
It was a shame.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Your daughter's been taken.
Why?
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
This isn't happening...
The rain is letting up.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Then tell me what to do.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
I'll boil some water.
And he still sits there?
But I don't know what's going on.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
You're JP Monroe, right?
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
Thank you.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
A prize?  For what?
I'm sorry.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Really?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Yes. 53
Oh, I don't ...
Really?
Oh thank God, you're dead...
The security's actually not that severe.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Alex!
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Did I miss anything?
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
You re not thinking of going to...
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
But I said I was sorry....
We're going in from the ground floor.
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
Anna, I think you better stay....
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Welcome back to Vinci.
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
A little petting is not the issue!
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
What have you been doing?
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Good job, not pretty, but good.
No, let me!
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
If you do anything to my friend...
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Why does this have to be so hard...
The Dancing Dingus!
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Adenoids?
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
Cigarette?
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
I'm sure I --
...Why don't I just type this up...
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Oh, is that it!
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...I'm sorry.
...Certain people are --
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
...The people look like ants.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Your i --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
I filed it yesterday.
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Watch it, Archer --
Just got hired today!
Terrific.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
This I know, Benny.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Norville.
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Oh, geez.
Geez, I --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
She finds him.
...No money.
Old Faithful.
She's got other problems, of course...
...Her mother needs an operation...
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
That's nonsense, Alma.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Alive?
You mean a figurehead.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I'm afraid so.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Mrs. Rand...
She can never be cured?
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Yes.
Where were you trained?
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
Mr. Holland?
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
But she's not dead, Wes.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Why was the maid crying?
I'm sorry...
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
You didn't drive her mad.
Well?
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You wanted to warn me...
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
In other words, I'm on trial.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Right o'.
I wasn't star--
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Good night.
So early?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
See for yourself.
Don't start.
What's on your mind? Don't --
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Well?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Ben--
What are you talking about?
Dad stop it!
What you been up to?
Talking to me, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
What?
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
A key party?
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Yeah. You?
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
With Mikey?
Nobody.
Mom. Are you ok?
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Please don't.
Social work?
You ask what the point is?
Now you are being rude.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Am I right or am I right?
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Truly? Do speak.
How do you know this shit?
Who said so?
I don't ever want to see you.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Huh?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
All my model planes.
The ones you built?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
He's dead.
Want a drink?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Nice kid.
I have to get back.
My partner...
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Who's that?
I don't remember.
I know.
Sorry about...
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
I'll call him now.
So?
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
How do you mean?
Eight years.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
He's just rattling your cage.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
What is it?
One of your cases?
Will.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
How should I know?...
I don't know.
You don't know.
I was her best friend.
Since grade school.
You want me to take you somewhere?
No...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
My arm!
She was only seventeen.
You're not following procedure.
Wild card.
That is a picture, nothing more.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
I have not spoken to him...
Your lover.
Then blame the one who made her...
Are these not the answers you came for?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
I can't save her.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
I want some more.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
It will grow back again!
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Does it?
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Don't Louis --
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
You both did it?
Don't mock, Claudia...
Louis, look at me.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
This is no performance.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
What danger?
Do you think I would let them harm you?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
That's not so.
What do you mean?
They would have killed you -
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Did I hear a yes?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
But how do you know?
I can't.
You fool, what have you done?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
I don't pretend to know.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
NO!!!
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
What are you saying?
Lestat!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
That's all past, Lestat.
I have to go now Lestat...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
You followed me here, didn't you?
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You loved your wife, surely.
He did it to make you stay with him!
It's over, I'm telling you...
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Your what?
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
Get lost, you scared me.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
Say yes.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
Oh!
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Be careful, Julie.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
No, you're not.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Yeah.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
I love it here.
Checking the locks again?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
To get out of Southport?
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
It's...him.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Pretty cool bar.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Come on, it'll be fun.
Well, I'm in school and --
Jeez, that's a full carat --
What's the matter, boy trouble?
And so could you -- crazy fool.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
They were cut loose.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 
Drunk again?
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
You're just talking nonsense.
My friend -- what can one say --
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
All the graves?
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Poor Cathy --
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
What are you doing?
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
What an odd question!
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
Whet do you mean?
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
What would I be thinking?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
Woman, what are you doing here?
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Her name is Thea?
Theodosia.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
It makes me fear her.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
You are my friend.
If I told you  you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -
I have had command for the last time -
Daughter -- my daughter --
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
George . . .
Good morning, sir.
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Go through with what?
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
No.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What?
Sit down? What are . . .
A boy?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
Splendid! Is he sick?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Well?
When'd you see him last?
Hi, Daddy.
Well, what happened to you?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Big  see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Came back three days ago.
Nice girl, Mary.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
Oh, it's wonderful.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Maybe you were born older, George.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Got a match?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Hello, George, how are you?
George.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
What's that?
Well, what do you know  wife.
Why didn't you call me?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
When?
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
I'd like to do that.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Neither am I.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Eighteen.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Uh-huh.
About what?
Didn't you tell her?
When did you get back?
Where'd you get that dress?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
After that, who cares?
Please, let's not stop, George.
Have fun.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
George Bailey lassos stork.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
I guess you forgot something.
You can?
For me...?
Wheee!  Faster!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Don't!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
No.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Yeah.
Shut up.
That's awful.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
The lighthouse?
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
Want to talk about it?
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
If there is, develop it!
I know just where to go.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Mike's out there.
Untie that rope.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
You said something about a camera.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
What else you got?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Wait a minute....
Too late, it's written.
There is nothing to discuss.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
What's that supposed to mean?
The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
We don't know that, do we?
Do you?
That's it.
Probably.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Late.
Eat Cheerios.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Oww!
No.
Do you?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Sean's asleep.
What?
Because of today?  The beach?
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
I know you did....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
Someone has to do something.
Martin, it could be anything.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
They made me go with them.
Is that me?
That's you.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Terry!  You okay?
That's a crock of shit.
The wind drift is lateral.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Mmmmmm.
Right after, the Kids went out?
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Figure they split?
How much longer?
Until we find something.
About damn time.
No.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
You're going sailing.
Michael....
Don't feel bad.
Go on, Doctor.
He's going with you, Doctor.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
You buying?
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Well, not much longer to go.
What is it, 97 days?
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
It's his work.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Not enough loving.
Damn it!
They just wanted to say hello.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
What's that?
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Change your mind?
You want me to stay?
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
You don't.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
No, we'll go through here.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
So tell Calvin.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
Somebody better get down there!
Come on!
How is he?
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Go where?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
No, no.  That won't do.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
You can get killed!
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
No!
Like hell!
Why?
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Not at all.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
Don't blame yourself.
Not good enough.
Sure.  No problem.
How you doing, Kelly?
I don't know, it depends.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
The one that goes underwater?
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Told you you'd like it.
No...  It can't be.
Take it up!
I don't talk that way.
Ahhh, ahhh...
Yes, there is goes.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
No, South Georgia.
Oh...
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
That's impossible.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Who's grown up?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Sure.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
But you always let me....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Yes, I did.
We need milk....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
What the hell are we arguing about?
Off....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
It'll grow on you.
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
All he did was kiss me....
Beginning of what?
They won't kill it....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
Stop what?
That....
That hurt....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I see what you're doing....
In a minute....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
You're coming, aren't you...?
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
What?
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
Dad died from a heart attack....
All you all right?
I'll be all right, Michael.
You could teach...You could....
You just got here....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
I don't want to talk about that.
You hungry?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
I'm fine.
No, you're not....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I have my own little island.
I could take some time off....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I'll get it back next time.
You the architect?
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Matt?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Stop busting my hump....
Will you leave me alone...?
Put me down....
Bad boy....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
They put bombs on dolphins....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
Where is everybody?
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
Okay...we got it together....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
How long has he been here...?
What's so funny about that?
We lost it....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Shit....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
All the time....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Who grows more beautiful....
I told you....
Oh, Jake... 
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Where's Lenny?
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Only me and Mom ..
Did you bring it with you?
I hope I'm not intruding?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What does that mean?
Maybe?
How'd you do it, old man?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
What do you want it for?
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
Did he shut you down?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You looked like you did?
Why's she blind, Bro?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
I'm going up to the institute.
I guess by the bed.
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
I thought it was Taylor's case?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
What are you looking for?
Bullshit.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
You must have some idea about him.
No.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
The elevator wasn't working?
Did Amber have a dog?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
What are you reading?
No.
No.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
You said, you were in the bad lands?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I know about alcohol, John.
You do?
Interview over, Blattis ...
When did John divorce?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
You think John would like it?
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Ugh!
Well, no you didn't --
This can't be happening to me.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Oh come on --
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
You think so?
Wonder what he said.
Hello?
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
... light.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Too bad.
Well.
Well, good evening.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
You don't have to explain.
Yeah, what happened there.
Maybe you should call her.
What?
Sure you're okay to drive this?
If I said that, would you stay?
Tell me -- let me help --
I don't need you to "stick."
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Thank you.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Mmm.  Hmm.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Call me tomorrow.
You love me now, don't you?
Rod --
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Great word.  Towel?
Is that your porty or mine?
Forget it.  Forget it.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
You never had The Talk, did you?
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
Jerry --
One-two-three, swing.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
What's going on, Jerry?
Shut up!!!
Oh, my God.
What is it?
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
He says it's a bad idea!
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What?
Eric! Are you here?
That one time was just the bumper.
You couldn't have made that jump.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
I dont know.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
How was your trip? Profitable?
You rented an automated litter box.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
NO!
Hmm?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Eric, your parents are both here.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
Yeah.
What did you think?
Are you sure?
I want to be an astronaut.
But then you never get to go in space.
Bonitas.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
Hmmm.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Well that's good.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You hear something?
It doesn't matter what I think.
Resentful.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
What?
John . . .
Oh --
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
That was about a year ago.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
What is?
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
Then this is our chance.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
No.
We can't stay in here!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Because it exists.
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Ian.  It's guano.
That little black line?
Ask her.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
You shouldn't use my name.
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
Once we have control again we - -
They died together?
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Constantly sick.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
Ellie, com one!!
I'm going with you.
Come on, let's go.
Why not?
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Oh, imperfections?
Can we chance moving him?
Yes?
Why not?
In a box under my seat.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
Listen, ahh - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Go, go, go, jump!
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Kids get scared.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
He left us!  He left us!
Tim, Tim, Tim....
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
Watch how it eats!
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
John, John.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Well?
Thanks for the presents.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Why did you do this?
They don't bother me.
That's not funny.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Yeah?
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Who is this? What's going on?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...
A house?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
You think that's going to work?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
How long will he need to be asleep?
Cute waitresses?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
You saw him?
What are you doing?
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
How long will the effect last?
We're down to seven minutes.
What happened? Where's Jason?
Where do you live?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Just what you've published.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
It's my last and final one.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I usually take lunch by the River.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
-- Eduard --
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
How long were you and Eduard --
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
Why were you given notice?
I've heard of it happening.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
What did she say?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
What's the matter with you?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
... A piece of paper ...
-- You seem amused.
Orlac is an account?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
This is filed incorrectly!
Then that's the place for us!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
I photographed it extensively, father.
Father!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -
He's grubbing for money, father.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Where do I charter a boat?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Can you fly?
I want to thank you.
There's a light up ahead.
We're leaving.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Yeah.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
What about him? Yes.
Uh uh.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Why isn't he locked up?
Yes -- all right --
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Gee.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
-- Tuscarora --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
-- OK?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways. 
And I don't think that was Tom.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
How can you do it to yourself?
No.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Is that all you have to say?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
Then, close the case.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
No.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Yes sir, we know he --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
What about your mommy?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
What do you like best about your daddy?
Playing.
In real life when does he hit you?
Greatest...
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
You're late.
Okay...Same as usual...
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Mom, I mean dad...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
I think I'm going to throw up.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
You're no bargain either, pal.
Yeah?
Sleep tight.
Yes?
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Yep.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Uh, huh?
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Objection!
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Yes, your honor.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
I do not, your honor, however--
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Six years.
Objection!
And how did you find his work?
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
No.
No.
No.
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
Yes.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
I consider it less my failure than his.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Where are you going?
I've seen him.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
You want what?!
Joanna, what the hell is--
Only can I still see him?
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
So...what's so terrible about that?
I know....I know.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Fine.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Oh, Christ!
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
What if I fight it?
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
How the hell are you going to do that?
How many?
No.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Got it.
You're on your own, understand?
You're sure?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
You ever think about getting married again?
Three.  And add some basil.
California?
She ever ask about me?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Where are you from?
Kham, Holiness.
Not the way to talk to people.
No.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Can I free the prisoners?
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
I have.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
With much bloodshed.
Holiness?
Cow.
I accept it. What is suffering?
I need to squeeze this brain.
You could buy them.
How big is Tibet's army?
No. This war is almost over.
What can I do? I am only a boy.
What is the size of our army, now?
Where is that?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Please, come in, so cold.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
But you will always be here?
Does he have the spot?
Is that a true story, or pretend?
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
Yes.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
No, Holiness.
We have.
Tell me.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
We cannot.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
I haven't broken any laws.
I'll sue you.
Go!!!
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
Mr. Cyr!
Keystone what?
We are here on official business.
Cocktail?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Jesus Christ!!
You're crawling around like a--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Yup.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
I can arrest you!!
Where is he?!
He never said "go".
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
I got something on the screen.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Thank you, Jack.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
I never had sex with you!
He was an Indo-pacific.
Nothing's real.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
No.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
So I don't like tents, why--
I'm not making it up.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
In Maine?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
Okay.  We're up at six.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Sorry.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
I'm not mushing it.
We might as well pack.
Are we crazy?
Well...
We gotta get to Hector!!
Well...
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
No.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
Now I'm gonna puke.
He's done.  He's dying.
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
What?
They don't believe her.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Are you alright?
Hank!
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
The somebody else part?
Hey.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
This is what we do?
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Myra.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Why not?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Hot damn, Clarice.
Where?
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Jack Gordon.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Why?
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
What do you see, Starling?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
What would it take?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
I didn't.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Then please - do this test for me.
Your bleeding has stopped.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
I don't know. Is it?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
Go, Doctor.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
Killed outright?
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
Why so briefly?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Then tell me how.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
But you could. You did.
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
You know I can't make that promise.
Time, Pilch! My move.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
My God, you've grown up.
Yes, miss.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
The Ottawa are gone.
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
I'm sorry.
Much further?
No. I will find you.
Are we safe?
And my compliments to you...
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
My God, Alice.
I see...
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Then what?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
And if we're unlucky?
Got a reason to stay.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Webb's at Edward?
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Excuse me. What did you say?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yes.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
What's wrong?
Be careful with it.
Doc eat already?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
It's got Hazy!
I thought they were your friends?
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
No!
Where the hell've you been?
What?
Sixpack?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
We made it!
What about our quota?
What's wrong with it?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
What's your air reading?
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
Yes sir...
Bullshit.
It...almost got you.
Still bothering you?
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
How far away is she?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Clear for pickup.
What is it?
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
I'll kill him!
Probably no longer than four weeks.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Bacon, see what we got.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
What's that?
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
I thought this was a pub.
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Nope.
Can I help?
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Son, have a look in his locker.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Is he on his own?
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
We gotta get those guns.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
No.

And all your friends, there's a good lad.
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Invitations.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
Well, what did he say?
I'11 meet you in the car.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
I'll see ya.
That you, boy?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Go on.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Look. Go on, look.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Six.
The money, the gear!
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
Oh, come on, Amado--
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
I can fix cars.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Yes, sir--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
No, sir. Not at all.
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
We're not running a dating service here.
Sergeant?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Sam the Man.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
I hear they're closing that post down.
He swore by it.  What?
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
You little pissant--
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Do I seem jumpy?
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
Yeah, well--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
You were in a fight--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
Come on in--
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
My mother said he never asked about--
That guy who got shot--
PDA?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Didn't have a father?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Are we going to ever see your father?
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Made some money, came back here--
What?
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
That ring--
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Yeah. I bet he would.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Why would you want to do that?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
I thought you were married!
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
We have a daughter.
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
'57, 1 believe--
Historic occasion, isn't it?
We don't need a new jail.
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
--Santiago.
That so?
Right.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
Bledso
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
You thought any more about our murder?
Hey, Sam.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Steve?
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Right. When he was killed.
Thank you.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
You ever play one of these?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
People didn't complain?
I don't think you can take it personally--
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
What about it?
You got in late last night.
Morning, Sheriff.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Murdered him?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
No--
So why did you come back here, Sam?
Pilar--
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Yeah.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
You don't need to cuff me.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
How come you don't took familiar?
Been away. Up to Houston.
Mister D'Amour?
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Thirty-five bucks.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
My life was too weird for her.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Hokey enough for you?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
What about death?
Please.
I could scoop them out.
He's with us...
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
What's the connection?
Does that mean...?
Sorry.  You asked.
Harry.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
Why?  Because he had you?
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Oh Christ.
He was the real thing, right?
I told you --
What then?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
It's okay.
Quaid and Jennifer--
What was that?
I've got to help him.
Oh God.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
Trickery and divinity.
They weren't worth a damn.
Oh, I've got plenty.
It's one in the afternoon.
Then what do you want?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Whose is the car?
You know of him?
Are you a gambling man?
Are you sure?
What the fuck are you doing here?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
D'Amour --
Don't bother.
A Mister Quaid?
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Where'd you learn that?
At birth.  I don't know you --
Harry D'Amour.
For what?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
He deserved it.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh Jeez.
Didn't know you read minds.
Is that all?
They got here before us.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
Yes?
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
What?
You don't think I've got it to give?
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
No!
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Bob, it's me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Ok.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
I don't want to go home.
Hello?
It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Ok, whatever you want.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
I know.
You are.
Nice one.
What happened to your toe?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
I'm sorry.
Tomorrow.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Oh?
Do you like massage?
My stockings.
Hello, darling.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
It's just carpet.
Is there anything I can do?
What?
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Fine.
Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You wanna come?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Uh...sure...I...what?
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Hmmm.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
I don't know.  What are they?
She's been stalking you, Peter.
What a...jerk!
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
It's nothing.
My secretary?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
No, I wasn't, actually.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
You fucking bastard.
Father, I'm right here.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Two negatives always make a positive.
May I help you?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
So...what did you think of the tape.
And the point is?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
What do you mean?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
What about after?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
You know what?  You can go.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
What's this?
He could see me.
How're you doin' today?
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
She told me she killed them.
Nothing.
nothing.
That's not funny
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Engaged.
Yeah, you met her?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Whatever.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
That's ridiculous.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
The blue.
Okay.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
You could make a career by telling me where.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Hello.
It means a lot that you came by.
So how long is this trip?
I don't know sometimes.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No one's forcing her.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
This brother from my college.
Oh, great.
Too many times.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
What?
I know.  But chances are...
Hey, munchkin.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
One, up.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
I never knew a girl that could play.
What?
What's that?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
God, here we go.
Would you watch the damn road?
Hey.
You having fun?
Early night for you, isn't it?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
What'd it say?
You do see me standing here, right?
Forget Tonya Randall.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
That was so weak.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Hey.
he's just playing, Q...
Hey, what's up.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Least she had time for me.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
What are the doctors saying?
Not for Quincy McCall.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
I'll play you.
For what?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
What will this prove?
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
What's that, not great?
Nona, please.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
How was your game?
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Where's your dad?
You scared me.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
What's Mom think?
Your door was unlocked.
We need to talk.
And some things should never fucking happen!
What do you want?
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
Your teeth are straight.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Hello?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
I'm here, I'm listening.
Uh-huh.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
What kind of Cancer?
Oh, she's fine.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
Your mother wants to hear from you --
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
What?
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
About two years ago.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
The gentleman who came to the door --
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
Well...is that illegal?
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
So you've done it --
Why not?
You wanna make a deal with me?
ok.
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
Let's make a deal.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I lost my gun.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
What?
Just say no.
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
please, what is it, please --
-- you the resident here?
What's your name?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Diet Coke.
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Where's the news department at this studio?
C'mon guys, settle down --
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
Why the hell aren't you in school?
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
No Can Do.
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
I'm almost done.
I was listening --
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
What happend?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
....do you know who I am?
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
Stay that way.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
Braces.
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
And how much is braces?
Yeah.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
How's today then?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Where is he?
I'm trying.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
There's no asshole like you.
Go fuck myself?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
No.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
All it takes is one second?
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
Is that still lingering?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
In aid of what?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
She's my mother.
He passed away.
Kind of.
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Is Linda here?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
How long have you taken care of him?
Is he in pain?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Oh yeah.
...ok...
You're just come in --
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
There's no disturbance.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Ok. What's your name?
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
Then what?
All your other fluzzies?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I'm sorry.
I need you to get me Paula --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Willa Cather.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
I'm drinking.
As fast as I can.
Did you tell her?
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
I love you.
I don't think I want that.
How do we do this, then?
You're my handsome man.
I'm a bad person.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
hey.
Just once.
What about now?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
Do you have any children with anyone?
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
But you can't say....
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I don't know what I've done.
She's asleep.
What's MOW?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
You need to sober up.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
mmmhmm.
818-753-0088.
Yeah.
Mmm.Hmmm.
mmm.hmm.
Ok.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Yes. What? Yes.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
We need more dog food --
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
You ready to keep winning?
Stand up.
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
Yes.
I have money.
...what...?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
What -- ?
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
What is it, mother?
I wish to discuss your brother.
No, Louis!  No!
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
It can.  I know the way.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Who is he, Aramis?
And people close to him, who --
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
But -- what is Porthos doing?
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Where are you going?!
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
Bloody hell...
No!  Stop --
You can't do it.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Where are we?
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
What use am I?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
But -- are you sure?
Die?  What...?
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
Thanks, but not for me.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I heard your playing.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
I know.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Get out of my way.
The King killed my son!
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Whose rooms are those?
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Phillippe...?
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Phillippe!
Eh?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Did they kill him?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
You would do that, your Majesty?
Shall I leave?
Did you know... about Raoul?
Captain Doyle?
What can I do for you?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
You mind if I ride with you?
It's Marvosa -
Yeah?
Where are you?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
Did you hit him?
Let's roll -
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Did you read today's paper?
Captain?
Where up north?
What's going on here?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
No.  A witness.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
What?
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
A bank?
Both at the same bank...
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
Long gone, huh?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
I wouldn't presume to try.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
How long do I have?
Book code?
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Somebody hurt him?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You look all right now.
As long as they're dead...
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
For Christ's sake, why?
The mark? Yes.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Who is it?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
'Changes?'
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
What's that?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
I'll take you.
Tonic will be fine.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
No. Reba...?
It's me.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Was I in an accident?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
'No' what?
Are you a man?
You'll let me go now?
Come in.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
Yeah...
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Most people are.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
What's average?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
At the store. You doin' some good?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
You haven't smoked in two years.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Will? Are you okay?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
What's the problem, Molly?
Maybe we should give it some time...
Let's forget who said what to whom...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
That's right.
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
We don't know that.
Did the girl die?
...after a while.
Stuart is fine.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Do you have the file with you
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
May I keep the file?
What do you want?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I don't believe in God.
Yes.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
You got it.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
People love... comedians.
Sitcom...?
George, I hate sitcoms.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
I refuse.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
How long would they let me sleep?
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
They're having a laugh...
What, you don't think I can beat him?
We were just trying to push the envelope --
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
So who's gonna pay for it?
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Andy!
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hi... am I late?
And all this will be for real?
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Have you told your family?
How can you be so casual??!
GET OFF!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
I'm gonna quit.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
I was very original!
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Are you at peace with your family?
"Philosophically"?
"Burlesque"?
Can I help you with something?
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
What's in Memphis?
A -- a tourist.
They are dead.  In either case --
You don't know.
Lieutenant?
That's the third white van I've seen.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
You don't, do you?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Hello, Trinity.
He had an accident.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Really?
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
What happened to them?
How?
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Just get me outta here.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Are they any agent?
They'll be able to track it.
Morpheus...
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
How?!
No!  It's too far away.
Do you still want to meet?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
This can't be...
Why do my eyes hurt?
More important than what is when?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
This isn't real?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
I know what you're trying to do --
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Why?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Morpheus, I don't know --
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Yeah.
That vase.
Who?
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Why?
God...
What did she tell you?
What did you just say?
What happened?  What did you see?
What is it?
Go!
Can you fly that thing.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
You don't have...
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
How?
Neo, this has to be done!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
You're not far from Cypher.
Neo!
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
May God be with you.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Where to?
And say what?
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
Panther...
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
That's not going to help.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
How?
Don't be smart.
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Back so soon.
No.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
You getting out too?
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
$20.
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
Charlie, this is business.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Oh...around...why?
"Francis Macomber."
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Please take it.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
No.
It's still sick.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Come on.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
Can you spare it?
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
-- But he does seem very nice.
Look who's talking.
He's coming.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
-- Black.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
I haven't been the father to you that --
What about the Mayor?
...This shit's not bad.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
What do you do that for?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
I thought you were buying my company.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
And what would that be?
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Thank you for coming.
We have an arrangement now.
Thank you.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Yes.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
'Yes' to the deal?
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Sounds good.
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
'Joe...'
What do you mean?
Have we met?
No --
No.
Sit down, Drew.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Mind if I throw up?
Yours.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
You get not to go to jail.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
You're overthinking it --
Thanks, Quince.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Yeah.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Don' be facety, woman.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
You loved back?
She knows how she feel.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Confused, huh?  About what?
'Big'?
Do you love Drew?
Come again?
I don't have any.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Yes?
Goodnight, Joe.
Very well, I'll watch.
Watch me do what?
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
I appreciate you --
Has her pain abated?
How long have you been standing there?
Girlfriend?
To bed.
I'm sorry about --
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
For how long?
I love you in an evening gown.
It gets worse.
What will we do?
I love you now, I'll love you always --
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
When you go, I go.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
A 'deal'?
Bill --
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
How about giving a guy a break?
I want to live.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Dinner?  Absolutely.
Why did you go to the hospital?
I guess...
What way would you put it?
What's okay?
I'll be the judge of that.
I'm her father!
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
And I don't give a shit.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't expect you to.
Yes.
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
You fill the bill, Bill.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'Yes' what?
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Time.
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Thank you, Quince.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Bravo.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
Thank God.
What?!
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
It'll come back, Daddy.
Then what will you say?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
I don't know, I can't say --
Are you relieved?
But what?
Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
You and 'Honey'?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
Why?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
39.
79.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
30.
Well, what then?
Hiya.
You don't know?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
I have no memory.
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
Seen you together, that's all.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
A cop?
I like your car.
Jimmy?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Strip!
You think you can bargain with me?!
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
I wasn't helping you for money.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
What happened?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
What do the police think?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Where is he?
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
I'm not.
Help me.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
How do you know about me?
Who's your boyfriend?
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
What the hell you want to go there for?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
You said you were leaving town.
You're living.
Why are you here?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Natalie? Natalie who?
I'll ride with him. You follow.
From who?
What sort of questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
No, you won't.
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Your name's Teddy.
It is now.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
What cop?
* Thank you.							    *
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
I was the kids' godfather.
Sal Maguda.
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Yeah?
Where's the new drop point...?
You need to consider a few issues.
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Yes you do...
So...?
Okay.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
How fast does that go?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Your father?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Is it December?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I forgot the napkins.
Why?
When?
Of course.
Where would I go?
I know.  And now?
Red light, green light, Jos?
Yeah.
What friend?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
Alonzo...
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What do we got?
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Verdado.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
What is going on...?!
As in...?
I am asking.  You to me.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Twenty on my man...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Then you should.
Detective Crockett.
Never heard of him.
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
Control your men.
Yeah...?
Where's Riccardo?
C'mon, man!
So?
You mean with the flowers...?
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Conveyance?
That sonofabitch!
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
This the load you lost a while back?
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You sure you heard what I said?
What you gonna do back there, East?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
You don't seem like no fag...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Where'd that come from?
Yeah, well, so?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Don't need a comb.
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
And what?
I'm scared.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
They gotta be.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I'm wet.
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Thanks, Joe.
Gin's okay.
What you got me up here for?
Here. Don't even thank me.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
What?
Want me to take over?
What?
How's your hernia?
Anybody bitten?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Where you staying, Dad?
Those mountains? are they?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Where are the minefields?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Would you recognize him again?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Girlfriend?
What they give you?
That doesn't seem so bad.
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
Hello, Billy.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
And?
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
You got your stuff?
Yeah.
Hishradyo.
I think I've been poisoned.
Never was anybody like you...
Know what?
Who?
Jeremy...
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Peter...
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
There's really people living down here?
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
I think so. One right, two lefts...
And a right.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
I only got...
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
The kid's with them!!
He's special.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Oh, no, you were-
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Don't.
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Peter-
It worked before...
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
C'mon...
Ah...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
This wing configuration. I've never...
Fuck! It broke the skin...
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
What do you want to know?
Sure.
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
How long...?
If you wouldn't mind.
I don't have a title yet.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
I don't know.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
Misery's Return?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
I said that?
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
You've been out of your room.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
I'm glad you like it.
Yes, Paul.
Did I do good?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
He's your client, huh?
People sure like those Misery books.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Marcia, please.
Great.
All done, chief..
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
From her point of view or mine?
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Well that depends.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
'Thief in the Night?'
To win?
Feel like pleading for your life?
Where?
Fight a bit of a cold..
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Ninety-three point four million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How much longer before you can reach him?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Should I?
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
What if I pay the rent?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
At least you walked.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Hola..
Your help?  What are you talking about?
What's you name?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
I'd like a little more conviction..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Just like old times?
I managed.
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
Are you okay?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
No.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
An idea, yeah.
Like?
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I do.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Now how to get in there.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
This is bullshit - we dont even know what Max looks like.
Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
Is he serious?
Talking's good, walking's better.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Max made a deal with you?
I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
Theyre dead.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
I dont think so.
Yes.
No sir.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
I don't quite follow you.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What kind?
Why don't you come back with me?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
What was your deal with Job?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
IMF mainframe.
We'll see.
Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
Why?
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
I guess.
Why not?
He's our guy.
He won't be back in a hurry?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Can you lose him?
Where are you?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Yeah.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Why don't you take a look?
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
I always check the batteries.
No, I'm going.
Are you ready?
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I don't like him.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Yes.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
You haven't said anything.
Here.  Ti amo. 
Ti amo.
The guy died.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
Why you looking around so much?
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Yes!
Yes.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
You are going to marry my brother?
I like it well done.
He knew my husband who died.
Instantaneous.
I don't know.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Stupid yourself.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
A bride without a head!
Son of a bitch!
Your blood.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
What about Johnny?
What?
I've never seen a moon like that.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
I'm marrying your brother!
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
I can't!
But he wants me to come!
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
For what?
That was just so... awful!
He didn't come!
This is where we're going!
Let me go home.
Let me go home.
You've gotta get outta here.
No. I'm gonna wait.
No?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
I don't understand.
On the floor?
I like this ring.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
WHAT?
And who's gonna pay for that?
Will you live here?
I'm thirty-seven years old.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
How's the mother?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
What! How do you know?
A wife knows.
What the hell happened to you?
Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
She recovered.
WHAT!! She was dying!
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Hi.
Did you see it?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
That's a pretty big sin.
Don't fight.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Don't make yourself sick.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
That's it! That's the reason!
No idea.
Good.
I'm sure she did.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Sure!
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
Sorry. That was rude.
That woman was a student of yours?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Yes.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Yes.
I guess you can't invite me in?
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You mean the whole house?
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
She's got it.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Burn them.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Get away!
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
...What?
What do you mean?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Am I right?
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
No one live there.
Well, who is your lord?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Oh!
We want ... a shrubbery!
One that looks nice.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
You said it again!
None shall pass.
Had enough?
Course I have.
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Hello.
Are you sure he's got one?
Well, what are you then?
Now what happens?
Who ... Who breaks out?
Ni, ni, ni!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
What?
You know my name?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Look, you're a busy man ...
What?
There.
Je...sus Christ!
Old woman!
Man!
Be quiet!
Shut up!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Good idea, O Lord!
I feel fine.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
I can't.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Why?
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Farewell, Concorde!
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Gosh - Is he all right?
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
What - the curtains?
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
But I don't like her.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I'm ... your son ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
If we ... er ... 
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
What?
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Quick!
I don't think I was.
You got my note!
Oh!
I didn't.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
Aye, but will they?
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
And she sent no word down?
She'll get over it.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You know nothing about her!
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
What's this?
You should have someone look after you.
I hope to go up next year.
Checked and locked, sir.
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I wish to see my mother.
She's busy.
What did you say?
Whom you address.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
It is quite late enough.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Checked and locked, sir.
I'm sorry?
Her Highness' Equerry.
Do you?
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Occasionally.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
Then I envy yo.
Why?
So...?
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
In time, she will.
You are well?
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Archie.
Yes, ma'am.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
To keep out the cold.
What is it, John?  John?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Yes, ma'am.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
So?
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
You can't know that for sure.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
What's her excuse this time?
Erysipelas.
Not too protracted, I hope.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Yes.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Why was I not informed?
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
I have no idea.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Ma'am?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
What's the question mark?
Now what seems to be the problem?
It's the game, ARCADE.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
I came from the city on the left.
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Happy?
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Then leave her.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
The Police, then...
Then where do we go?!
You mean we learn the rules...
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
Put in a quarter.
You don't get it, do you?
One.  In case...
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
I'm okay.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
And then keep on driving?
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Then we'll go home?
Is that your question?
But I don't understand...
That's impossible.
So how do I start?
Give her a chance, will you?
Adam, where are you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
No.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
It's been a very strange day.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Will you meet with him?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Whatever.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Well, I ...
No, I don't.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Your Aunt called me.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Are you okay?
My name is Rita.
Yes.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Hi.
No, no, I'm fine.
Betty.
Can you tell me what happened?
Diane?
Number 17.
No ..........I.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
You don't remember anything else?
No.... I don't...
Okay.
Maybe it's not me.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"So... surprise"...
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
I don't think...
Betty Elms.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
You're so easy.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
I had a dream about this place.
You see what I mean...
So, you came to see if he's out there?
You feel it?
Yeah, they showed me
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Nice wallets.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Palmdale.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Not a coke or anything?
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
Why should we trust you ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
Now where do we go ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
First Bank ? But how ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
What do you mean ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
I wanted to let his family know....
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
You okay ?
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
I thought you made this place ?
Hey, try swimming. It works.
What the fuck are you talking about.
You okay ?
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
But, he's...
Stop the hydraulics.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
Trust is earned not given away.
So ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
I am thirty two.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Zachary.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Sir ?
I was.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Will he make it out ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
What the ... ?
What happened ?
The power went out in half the park.
How can this happen ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Thank you.
Do you want to go out with me ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Hi. I brought some wine.
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
Not now, Mom.
How's your foot ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
No.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
This is California, anything is possible.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
I don't think you're very polite.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy.
Do what?
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Seriously.
What boy likes you?
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
No nuns, got it.
We have a baby?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
I don't know if I want to.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
Well...
Hi.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Your mother?
But we made a business deal.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
You're over reacting!
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
Get married?
Change my name.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
And I thought I was weird.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Does it work?
Boyfriend?
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Just come and get it...right here!
...I dropped it.
Never heard of her.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
What's he smoking?
Yeah?

They're great.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Oh...what's that?
Not exactly.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Did it hurt a lot?
Really?
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Danny?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I think it's still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Deceased.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Pardon?
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
It's no big deal.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
I had a good time tonight.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Rock?
Do you want to?
Yes.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
VADA!
Dad?
I love this guy! 
You never cared before.
She likes to play bingo.
Can I go too?
Hi.
What are you doing.
Yes.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Really?
Do you miss her?
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Sure.
How much does it cost?
Thirty five dollars.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
I wrote a poem too.
Cause she's dying.
Does he love her?
My Dad was funny?
He's allergic to everything.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
I would.
Are you married?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Can I use your bathroom first?
No.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Uh huh, why?
NO!
Where's Daddy?
I'm allergic to it.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Oh great!
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Uh huh.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Hmmmm, interesting.
What?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Bed wetter!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
What?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
You're right, let's knock it down.
Run faster they're after us!!
Jump in the water!!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Uh huh.
But, I don't know how.
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Would you think of me?
For what?
I should look different.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
He can't do that to me!
No, he's ruining yours.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
I was devastated.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
And you believe that.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Impressive.
Zit cream?
Ben Gay.
Elmer's Glue?
Major.  Dish.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I did what I came to do.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
But I can't be dry.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
What else did he tell you...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
No.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
Jesus, we're trapped!
But he always says...
Exactly what?
Uh, Kimmy...?
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
It doesn't say th...
And she's all wrong for me!
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
Such as.
You're not eating.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Big weddings are so strange.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Dance card filled?
Where did we first hear th...
I'm up against a deadline.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
What happened?
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
This is her family and her fault.
... your one chance for true happiness?
The Big Hurt, huh?
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
It's two weeks.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
What?
Is there food?
No.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
His Word.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
They can come to the concert in the park.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
Barbara Jean.
What!
You know better than that.
D.C.
President?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
Yes, but we're just singing.
Howdy.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Come on. He's a crook.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
You bet.
He's my father.
Your brother?
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
How in the world did he get shot?
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Well, Mr. Green.
She sure sings nice.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
What did you say?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
What's this?
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Have you seen a woman about so high?
No.
You got a place to stay?
We don't mess with accessories.
Nash.
Nashville.
Oh... Well.
Next you'll be sick.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
It just is.
How long have you been with them?
And before?
Do you like him?
Yes. Who's this?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Well...How have you been?
I have to go. He sighs.
I can't.
I'm twenty-eight
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
You sound different. Is that really you?
It's me. What is it?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Where's Bill?
Where are you going?
How's your stomach?
Come on back to bed.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
What?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
You do?
I know a couple.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Got me an audition tonight.
You think I should take lessons?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
More or less.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Are we in a big hurry?
You got something you want to do?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Mickey!
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Who is we?
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
I see.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Yeah.
She was born without a tongue.
Say something.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Do you have a back up.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?
What I'd like to do---
She sings? What does she sing?
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Sorry about that.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Describe Mallory.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Where's it parked?
No.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
Yeah baby.
Yes.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Just for fun, I guess.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Where do the air ducts lead?
The entire wing?
That's my opinion.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
What's the travelling arrangements?
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Really?
Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Want me to come?
Fill her up?
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
That's right.
Want to keep your job, boy?
Walker and Williams.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Okay.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Guess I don't.
His profession?
Been over to the other mill?
That's two bucks, Joe.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
You working?
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
That's right.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
Not here, Duff.
But I would like to see you again.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
That's the way he is.
I didn't know you had one.
Are you married?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
How old is your boy?
Hi.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What happened, Duff?
Don't push me, Duff.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
What about him?
What's wrong?
What about them?
You didn't answer my question.
My kids want me to teach them.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
What about your boy?
You will.
About ten dollars.
Day work.
Don't do that!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
How come you don't hate their guts?
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
There's nothing to say.
I don't think that'll happen.
Duff--
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
'Don't sound so sure.
That's right.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Come on, Pop.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
Guess it's never been easy.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
I guess not.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
So I been told.
It's for your own good.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Omar, listen to me--
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Ghost a steppin' razor...
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
And then?
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Tell me the words.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
I saw your girl yesterday.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
You're pleasant tonight.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Right...
Never heard of him.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
We run. You crack the pattern?
What are you talkin' about?
It'll flatline your ass.
Want to fucking answer them?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Why should I want to meet him.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
You've been calling her name.
How soon is soon enough?
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
Too late?
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
...Feels like you.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
What's that?
Leave.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Jos, that's not what we're --
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
That is lingerie.
Bridgework?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Have you been there?
Have you been to any parties?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
What if I say no?
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Rob's?
Hey there.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
God, I can't do this.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Better person than I.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
It's just for a couple of months.
It was a long time ago -
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
And a gymnast!
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Dorothy Parker--
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
This seat taken?
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
Our penguin, right?
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
What?
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
He sure is big, Jack...
Yes.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Coming...
Taste it.
Uh-huh.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Just out for a while.
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
What about it?
You two got a thing going, or what?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You're fucked in the head.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
I figured you might like some help.
You know her?
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Are you sure?
What's all this.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Anything?
Disappointed?
Whoa!
What is it?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Hi, guys.
What's that?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Crossed over?
Tell me about the kids.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Never been here before?
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
What about Kristen?
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
Somebody else is out here.
A sad choice.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I could've saved them.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Uh, fourteen.
I'm a vegetarian.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
And then I... right.
Well, they can be.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
No thanks.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Hi.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Too complicated.
Whoopsidaisies.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Oh please sod off.
Wow.
You and every person in this country.
Well...
Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Sorry about that.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Yes.
No.  Not true...
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bella -- this is Anna.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes -- sort of...
What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
The others?
Mr. Thacker?
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Cappuccino as ordered.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Buggered?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
May I help you, sir?
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
No, sir.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
No, no.  She doesn't.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two?  That's it?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Try 'Flintstone.'
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Yes.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Yes.
Bad news.
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, Mister Harding?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Yes, Billy?
I was in luh-love with her.
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Get up, Billy.
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
H-H-Hearts.
What's your name, buddy?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
That's okay, kid...
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
So long, kid.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
Yeah, kid?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
In there.
What for?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Where ya goin', Mac?
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Martini!
What are you doing?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
A pecking party?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Lobotomy!
He can't hear you!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
I'm busting outta this place.
Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
When?
Bet a nickel!
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Yeah, Mac?
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Jesus God...
Oh, what's that?
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
In what way?
I see...
You bet, Doc!
I'm afraid not.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, Mac!
What's troubling ya, buddy?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
You look pretty healthy to me.
Because I quit breathing.
You think it's funny, huh?
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Yeah!
Got a cigarette?
No!
He's a patient, Rose...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
He's in charge.
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Hi.
On what?
There they are!
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Bet you ass...
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
You ol' fucker!
No, she wasn't my sister.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
What for?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm a liberal!
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Hi there...
Congratulations.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Damon Bradley...
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
You're limping.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
Does he love you?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So?
Where's Positano?
Oh.  That's nice.
Hey--
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
Yeah.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
There's no such thing.
What?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Very funny.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Well, not exactly...
Yes?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Sure.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Really?
Excuse me?
What?
No.  He smokes.
Scientologist.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Kate, is something the matter?
Have you seen him with someone?
It's a coincidence.
But it's July.
Does Dwayne know about this?
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
What?
Are you sure?
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
We're saved!
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
You expecting somebody you know?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
A little bad luck?
...and a fortune teller.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Whatareyoudoing?!
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
And you are?...
Kate.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
You miss me?...
No, why?
What?  You know him?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I have to talk to her.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
I'm gonna take her home first.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
I'm not thirsty.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's 
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
See! You don't understand!
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
You know how the Sisters are.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
What's that?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Do you like pigeons?
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
That was nice of you.
The things that go on.
Listen, you like beer?
How do you like it?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
And if you don't?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .
Edie... Edie... ..
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Terry, for God's sake.
Thanks just the same.
He's going to have to grow up too.
My pigeons... .
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
I don't get it!
Good luck.
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
...walk?
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Really?
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Better.
Looking for me?
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Yeah us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Count this.
You want to know somethin'?
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Listen Nolan
If I could get my hands on you...
Leave her alone, I tell you!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
In there.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
What do you mean?
I am--It's our only chance.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
You're talking nonsense.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
But they are not yet one of us.
A situation easily remedied.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
Well?
When!?
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I said not as a rule.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Yes, it is.
I want to speak with you, please.
Yes.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Adele?  You in there?
You did work for Emil, right?
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I'm not dressed.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
It's Richard Ripley.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
You at least bring the gun?
Outside of that.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
And she saw you?
You know how I felt about her.
You find out?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
They found the safe.
Come <i>on</i>.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
Jack --
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
I have to qualify, is that it?
You'll have to ask him.
Shut up.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
You know how to use one a these?
Nervous?
A little.
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
That's funny.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Bleeding on a country road.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Nothing.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
I mean, romantically.
How'd you get this number?
That's my dad.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
You like bourbon?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
A girl.
I called your room from downstairs.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You really wear that suit.
She did, huh.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
So.  What's your point?
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
In the trunk?
Weren't you expecting us?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Have they got Midge up there?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
Meaning time came, I left.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
That time?
You don't remember me, do you?
I remember you now.  Shit.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
You're not?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Why's that?
I'm freezing my ass off.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Uh-huh.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
That was some shit, huh?
What do you want?
That's not Maurice?
You not with probation, one of those?
He said he stayed here last November.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Got run over by a car.
Thanks, Dad.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
We don't get to talk much any more.
You were talking in your sleep.
He doesn't even look like that.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
You gonna go get him?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Midge.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
You mean hiding them?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
You're Walker, right?
Yes Sir.
Where's that lizard?
Good shooting, Danny!
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
Sorry.
Waitress!  Four beers!
We gotta face some facts here.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
How come you're not pukin'?
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
It's tight.
Land of the free.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
We've always tried to beat each other.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
I can't make it.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Don't get smart with me, son.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Well sure, Colonel --
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Our doctor's gone too.
Win?
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
What if the Japanese did invade?
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
How do you like my hair?
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
The only one?
Where is it?
I'll call you Later.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
What happened?
Charlie really has a great voice.
We're here on the sofa bed...
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
You drive like a maniac!
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Want me to drive you home later?
Where did you get that sweater?
Great, isn't it?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
Charlie. About last nights..
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
I just can't trust you anymore.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Does this mean you like me again?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
I love you.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Come back to me.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Oh, God, Dion.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Yes, sir.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Terry, slow down.
Terry! Slow down.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Don't you get along with your parents?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I'd love to.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
It's Charlie!
Ssh. He's great.
What?
Young lady, you're drunk!
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Yes.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
How do you feel?
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Would you get that, dear?
What happened to you?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Maddy's party.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
Dancing with you.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
What will they be made of?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Will you take of f your blouse?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
I was building a doggy door.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Yes... why?
Out?
What?
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Hey! Where're you off to?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
All set?
What did?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
You want me to help?
It's weird...
What do you mean?
You ever think about running away?
How long have you been here?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
I know, Mom.
Are we interrupting, Andy?
What in God's name... ?
Do you really think so, Andy?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Don't apologize for me.
One hour!
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Ready for what, baby?
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Innocuous?
I buy that.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Find a lawyer?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
They didn't fire her?
PARRTYY!
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
Get it?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Correct.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Uh huh...
What?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Particularly, Charles.
Except... you were gay?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Do you take risks?
Gay movies.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Some do. I didn't.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
That's right.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Mom?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Were you recently promoted?
Is that a question?
Objection!
Objection!
Get real.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
We won.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
What kind of people?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
How many gays do you know?
Lots.
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Okay, Joe...
Don't know, Joe.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
You did this? To yourself?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Entered our minds.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
We can, can't we? Trust you?
How many you see?
As fast as you can.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Here. Make it easy on you.
What do my eyes see?
Like the light is scalding it.
Not sure. Ten?
Big Evil?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
S'matter?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
He used that?
So why isn't it all bloody?
Well, don't ask me to.
How many?
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
79 kilos.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Company's not here, is it?
Hasan?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
New Mecca....
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
We crossed our own tracks.
King Tut's tomb....
A toast to whatever he just said.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Very big beads.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
I'd rather piss glass.
Such as.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
So which one caught your eye?
An' this?
So much for your nightfall.
What, it's broken?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
How did you know we'd come here?
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
The best. But we won't need them.
Where does the river lead?
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
No.
What's so special about him?
Remembers what?
Now, just a minute --
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Any particular reason?
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Objection!
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Landon! Send a last signal.
What signal?
Gone.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
long pause) You know it.
If only we could get a fix.
Climb off me, will you!
But I'm not prepared to die.
Who are you?
Zira doesn't want your female.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
What is it?
He wouldn't leave her.
Who put them up?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
One is in a museum!
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Then you admit --
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Stop right there.
Twelve hundred years ago.
Of course.
Sure.	In a cage.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Shhhh!
You! ... You knew about this?
Yes.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
You want her that much?
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Why not?
We can't.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But the proof? The doll?
...but 'Lias is still out there.
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Come on man!
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
...there's nobody.
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
What are you talking about! 
Merle?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
You don't want to hear about it?
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
Vancouver, B.C.
Thank you.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Would you mind?
I think I'd like to dance.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
What did you say his name was?
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
And do you amuse the guests?
Do you think I don't?
How did you meet him?
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Dance? Here?
They know you here--know your name.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
Why?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
Nothing matters.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine...
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
See anything?
Cold?
Wonder what?
If you're doing all this just for me.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Mine?
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Me?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
If I understand what you meant by that.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I don't want to talk.
I expected nothing else.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
To do what?
What will they do to you?
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Got the information on you?
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
So you're not a cop.
Round of golf Saturday?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
Time for a little chat?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
It could have been an accident.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
A little something on account perhaps?
Passkey?
You nasty, sardonic--
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Floater?
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
Right.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Where's the shell?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
What about me?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Now, you're being beastly.
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
I don't know, sir.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I have a rough idea.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
Years, why?
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
It's terribly good.
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
How nice.
Both dead.
Damn.  They're early.
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't really thought about it.
Jeremy phoned this morning
What did he want?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Not here.
To the airlift.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Let me see.
Oh yes.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
Perhaps I will, then.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
So how is she?
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Yes, you said.
No.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Now listen...
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
You're so famous now.
Oh no!
What have you got there?
Promise?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Where?
Don't you gamble?
A flaw I'm working on.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Three seconds... two... one...
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Johnny, it's the only way.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Did he rob it?
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Nothing?
I know where they're going.
Kid, get outta the way!!
What do you want?
This gonna take long?
Who's the girl?
Catch of the day.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
What?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Tyler, put the gun down.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Like the old days, Dillon.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
You're wastin' your time.
I'll see you there.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
What, Sergeant?
Any sign of the hostages?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
I think it's Hawkins.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
He knows our defenses.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
There's no way you could know that.
We can reach an understanding on this.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
You what?
Mr. Harris.
Yes.
What's that?
Yes.
Sit... and spin.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
It pays.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
For the whole night?
I never joke about money.
No, but it's getting there.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Do you plan everything?
Let's talk some more first.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Just a romantic, that's you.
No?  Why's that?
Vivian --
Not... quite.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Did you buy some clothes?
The Rex.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Was someone rude to you?
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Good.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
No.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
What's that?
Edward, I can't.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Did you?
I've never treated you like a whore.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Right.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
My what?
I want to.
What!?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
You're being ridiculous.
Did I wake you?
I'm up.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
He... he just does.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Who did you think?
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Go for the bucks.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Yeah, what?
Rent.  You're late.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
I'm just going to my room.
What's your name?
Niece?
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Miss Vivian --
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Who are you?
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Of course you will.
Can you move at all?
We'll never survive.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
Gently.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
I believe you -- So what happens now?
I thought I was going faster.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Probably he means no harm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
I don't think more than ten.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
The Man in Black?
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
You've been mostly dead all day.
Will this do?
I brought you a special present.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Yeah. It's really good.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Oh no. No, please.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
No.  To the pain.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Your guess is as good as mine --
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Now?
-- all that I have and more please --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Slow going?
Sorry.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
You're sure nobody's following us?
I want to duel him left-handed.
Australia.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Oooooooops!
But sir, I'm not condem ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
What is that?  A handkerchief?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
What did I do?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Where would you like to eat?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
You found a flop!
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
What???
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Max, I...
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Yes.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Vaaaat???
But he has long hair!
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Do you need us?
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
You, Blum go Motel.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Like clockwork.
I shall count the minutes.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Nietzche...
The Graf Spee...
The Graf Spee...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Okay.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
What do you do best?
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
Tell me all about her.
No one met her?
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
And when she left, she never came back.
Anyone at home?
No. I told you, she's confined...
Let's all talk about Mary.
Who are you, friend?
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
What?
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
Lila.
With you.
A good reason, I suppose.
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
She haven't even called you?
You've led a charmed life.
She'll need both of us.
It's been three.
Just wait here?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Who's he?
Well?
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
Watch your tenses.
You going to wait here for me?
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What makes you sound so certain?
You can't go up there.
We could laze around here a while longer.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Can you?
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
I'm thinking of it.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
I'd like to.
I've caused you some trouble.
Uncommon, too.
Is your time so empty?
Why do you ask that?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
You should... mind it.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Thank you, Norman.
Norman.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Alright, Miss... 
Crane.
In quite a hurry.
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Please... I'd like to go...
I'm sorry.
May I see your license?
Norman took a wife?
Just coming up to ring for you.
Looking for me?
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Just before she died she came to--
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
No-
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Maybe you're right.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
That's it. You get it quick.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
What's down there?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
You're losing your blood?
Yes.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
Yes, why?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
I won't let you say that!
Well, I do say it.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
It happens that I'm the law.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
You give me a pain!
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
I used to be married to one.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
No kiddin'.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
That's the one.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
I see. Was that all she said?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Is that a fact?
Fire insurance!
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
A place you've never been.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Nobody.
In what sense were they bad?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Don't mention it.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
You better quit that.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
You won't die, Rose.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Neither do I.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Of course not!
What do you think, Brother?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well... maybe...
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're discussing it.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
She's putting the titty back.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
No, Mother, he's lying...
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Then why does she act so dumb?
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
A wonderful woman, boy.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Please do.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Oh. Did you say something?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
You're not having lunch?
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Well, she's back.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
I am not being brutal to her!
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Well, it's Billy.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
What's the use, there ain't none.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Um-m, well...
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Afraid of the hospital?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Well, you run on now.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Never again, never again...
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I was going to tell him.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
And... ?
Who cares?
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
I need the "when" and the "where."
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Sons of bitches!
I can work this.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
Relax.
I'm just saying...
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
Name one.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
They... they shot me.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Nope.
He tried to kill us.
You going rogue on me?
Can't I?
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
You know what I mean.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
Oh yeah?
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Do tell.
They're... around.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
There's still good in him.
But I have no sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Vader's on that ship.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Hey, are you awake?
Shall we try and go around?
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Han! Chewie?
What are you telling them?
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
We shall double our efforts.
There it is!
Quiet.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
He's my father.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Yoda, I must know.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Certainly not!
You!
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Janet.
Yes Brad.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Right!
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Good God.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
"Transylvania"
Free to try and find a game
No no no, no no.
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Who's Eddie?
...How's the turtle food this week?
...I don't know.
It doesn't bother me either.
Would ya like a glass of water?
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's not that --
It's okay.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
They're all the same.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
'Bout seven.
Sharp -- Real nice.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...I dunno.
No... I can't!
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Christ.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
It's not your house --
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Owe you what?
You's the novelty, Champ!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
He won't last one round.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
...Stop jivin'!
Damn.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Hear she's retarded.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Don't like yours neither.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
No dollar.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
This a con?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Here -- Three minutes.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What's ya name again?
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
How'd you know?
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Rocky.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
Did you hear what I said?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
...Screw you.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
I won't.
What was I gonna say?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Yeah.
...Tomato?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah --
...Who'd ya fight?
Think about it.
Ya puttin' me on?
Yeah.
Whatta' those?
Fifty years, huh.
...What?
How I look out there, Mick?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Yo, Paulie.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Ice skate.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
I'll do okay.
How ya feelin'?
I got whiskey here.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Gazzo's a good man.
What gaps?
What can I do about it?
Do you feel you have a chance?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
So where is it then?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Shoulda guessed.
What's this, Roger?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Check the scrawl.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Sounds like singin'.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
You?
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
Why didn't you tell me?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
What's with the dip?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I got him on loan from Disney.
When will I hear from you?
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Have you got the will?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
How do you know that?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Yeah?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Leave Me!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Out--
Of love?
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Every man betake him to his legs.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Good marrow, father!
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Well, what was yours?
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Do you have it?
Do you really think so?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
Well I don't!
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
What is?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
It's been known to happen.
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
Nobody's saying they don't.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I'd stake my reputation.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
We'll die if we stay here!
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
I don't have it with me...
A means to an end, is that it?
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
What are you doing?
Really?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
How did you know?
American.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Soon.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Created?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
You seem one to me.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
It's been known to happen.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
Who's they?
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Coordinate what?
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
Jujitsu.
What's the difference?
I do.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Like Larry or Swede.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
What's going on?
I just wanted to see something.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I borrowed that, too...
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
And what job is that?
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You know him?
What's this?
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
It's my job.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
You think?
I don't know...
I'm not here very much.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Do you have a good answer?
Finish the job...
And now...
What's the story?
Gaelic.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill her?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
What the hell happened here?
I don't know what you're -
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Seven thousand...
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
No.  We can't.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
We don't know that.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Well someone's gonna find them.
Why?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
I've got one condition.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
He's going to be trouble.
Well what are we supposed to do?
It's gonna be o.k.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
And you're solid on that?
What's your offer, Jesse?
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Hi.
OK.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I love you Sally.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
I don't know.  My friends...
Sally, do you love me?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
What are you getting at?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Dwayne.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Lingerie...
Anything I can help you with?
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Have I seen her?
C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
She's not his type.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Something wrong, Jesse?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I didn't say that.  You did.
Whatever...
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
So I want the money and I want it now.
You're never getting that much.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
How's work?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
At least around here it does.
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
Well I don't know --
Not in the trunk.
I'm not getting an answer.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
What the hell is that?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No, I just assumed...
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Wait.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
This is your ship?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
I'm busy at the moment.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
That's right.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
What are you doing?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Carter?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Good at what?
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
It sounds impossible --
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Why LA?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
You sound like that all the time.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
I don't want to hear this.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Let me see it again?
She saved our lives.
Shhh, my head hurts.
Why did you help me?
I'm not used to having a partner.
Well we're not friends.
Fine.
Yes.  We have heaven.
Are you serious?
Very nice.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
What?!?!
We made it, man.
Yes.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
I could use a little vacation.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
What's going on?
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
I know, but --
This is pathetic.
Tell me about it.
A little.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
-- what the hell is that?
Where were we?
Right....
The license!  You get it?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
You want more?
Yes, I know this song.
That's not how it goes.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
No, please, I don't --
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Not anymore.
You're killin' me here.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.
They put you in charge?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Jesus...what do you want?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
How about a lift home?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
What are you talking about?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
He is very good.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
You look awful.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Got any last minute advice?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
Good one!  Thanks.
Of course.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
I'll get the dress.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
What?
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Yeah.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Everest.  Is that right?
We think so.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
Too much.
Seven-fifty.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
To who?  Are you asking me?
Well, you do have the dress.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Used?
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
Grandma!
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
No.
You don't love me, is that it?
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Is that all right with you?
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Even when you were young?
I'll wait.
Happy New Year, darling.
Who is it?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
You okay?
What was what?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Did you talk to him?
Is this crazy?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
This is a photo of hair.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
What?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Destiny takes a hand.
What?
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
It's been about a year and a half.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
What are you going to do, Sam?
Why not?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
And you're worried about him.
Is he home right now?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Window.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
So I can go.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
-- a slice of pizza --
What do you think?
I know.
Like do you believe in heaven?
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Listen to this --
Dad!
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
It's only ten o'clock.
Everyone at work heard you.
Who is Annie?
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Did not.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Do you like it?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
You're kidding --
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Hi.
You could have called me --
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I read an article about this ...
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Well?
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
They are singing for me.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
What's more important than sanitation?
I'm a fool.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
What makes you so sure?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
No.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
You all right?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Sun up.
Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
No ...
Forgot what?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
That's it?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
What can I do for you?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Did you see his hair color?
You like that?
Who wouldn't?
Now that's down-right insulting.
Oh God.
Leave me out of this.
What?
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
It's not that easy.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Then leave.
Never heard of him.
Nothing.
This has nothing to do with him.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
You can still work.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Twelve
Where to?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Sorry.
That's a good one.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Palmdale
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
What?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
No, I'm good.
But I just met you.
I'm sorry?
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Just some buddies.
You go, boy.
No last name?
It's not my place.
I was getting to it.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
This chink have a name?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
The Mexicali Boys
He's the only one I told.
What's on the other end of this thing?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Excuse me?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
There's no motels around here.
You mean like the Donner Party?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Find a chaplain.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
A private, sir?
But, sir...I...I...
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
No kidding.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Yep.
Jackson?
Last I knew.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
No kiddin'?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
A half-track, anything.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Upham?
I wasn't made for this.
Some.
Over three-hundred.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
What about our grenades?
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Sure, you got one?
Captain, what about our deal?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Beasley's dead.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Nope.
Three for three.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
You're kidding yourself.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Is it getting worse?
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You alright?
Oh, yeah?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
I know.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Sure, Reiben.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Ours is not to reason why.
Huh?
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
Why's that?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
No, sir.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Maybe Caen.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Here they come.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
So, where are you from?
Demolition, right?
Pardon me?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Yeah.
Lloyd.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
What does it say?
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I am.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Tell me, is it bad news?
I won?
Morning honey.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Morning.
I'm fine.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey, about what?
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Hello.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Well...
Goodbye.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
So we can finally talk?
That's cool then.
Sure I do.
Then call me tomorrow.
Won't you see me later?
Okay.
What did you say?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
No.
I don't think so.
Then why are you shaking?
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Okay, what did we just decide?
No, I don't, I don't.
Is this because of your dad?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Did you tell anybody?
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
What do you want?
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
I'm fine.
Okay.
How's it going?
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
PAIN!
Jim Court?
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
Seriously, Lloyd.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
I know this part, keep reading.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
How you doin', brother?
You know Diane Court?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I love you man
Well, let's find him.
What's your name?
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
It's bad business.
He's important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You took my workers.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
Like this?
Good.  How's it going?
I need a drink.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Pots and pans.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Christmas presents.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I think it's too late.
That's very generous of you.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
He's broken his pattern.
Hang up...call...
I'm losing you.
Why aren't you there?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
That's too bad.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
And are the police sure about that?
What are you going to do?
What's your subject?
Let us decide that.
No. This is a set up.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
She's got guards with her.
Need some help, honey.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Youre the one who got away.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Or it found us.
Miss Weathers.
I see you read the book.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
I think you're all an act.
I know that.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
..and as lonely as I am...
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Just in case...
Who are you?
What do you want?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Where is your attacker?
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
..this week's TKE kegger...
She's not here right now.
What's your favorite scary movie?
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
But...
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
You ass.
I get scared really easy, okay.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
What are you talking about?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Melinda McGraw?
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Jesus.  Hello?
Hello.
I don't know.
Asshole, Can't talk.
What kind of a game?
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
What do you mean?
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
The killer called her.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
And?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Jennifer needs me.
Stop following me.
What's your point?
But you know who she was.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
I am Gale Weathers!
Need to get in that building?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
What'd he say?
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Let's get out of here!
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
W-what do you want?
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
Where?
Hello?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
How'd you do?
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Nope.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
Yes, sir.
Billy? What the...
Close call.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
So...
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
I thought you were...
Why did you kill my mother?
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Popcorn.
Just some scary movie.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
What did you say?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Nah, I don't think so...
You getting scared?
Is this some kind of a joke?
Sure...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I believe you...
So you better leave.
How do you know his name?
...please...
Afraid not.
No, not yet.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
So is Dewey your real name?
I'll call for backup.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Any word on my Dad?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
You girls ready.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
What were you doing out here?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Jesus...
Where is she?
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
What's the plan?
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Hello?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Are you okay?
Can you knock?
No you didn't.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
So what's his reason?
There goes my chance with Sid.
Yeah.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Why are you doing this?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
No way.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Give it to me.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
What do you think?
Have you heard?
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
What the hell's going on?
I don't believe it.
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
Spit it out.
You should be thanking me.
You've made a good life for yourself...
What the fuck is going on?
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Who said this was murder?
What?
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
You go to movies at least?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
There must be something.
Bullshit.
Does this make it with you?
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
It is Victor.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
How much money do you have?
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
This is a waste of time.
What are you going to say?
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
You knew I'd say yes.
You know he's fucking us.
Throw your gun down now!
Are you absolutely certain?
What?
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
It surprises me.  It really does.
Perfect example.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
You fit a lot of descriptions.
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
How many, would you say?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Unnt-meah!
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I've come now...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Keep talking.
I beg your pardon?
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
You all right, Ethan?
Say it. We're beat!
That don't make 'em kin...
But I just bought a good blanket.
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
What?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Ethan, quit it!
They'll be back...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Ellen, move aside...
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Do you know where fuse box is?
You?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
What?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Ellen.
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Do I look like it that much?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
NedI knowI know
Ah
You are a gentleman.
Thank you, my lady!
What do you want, Kit?
You have the last act?
Tomorrow.
Twenty pounds on delivery
Never!
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
We have no Juliet!
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ten pounds.
Words, words, wordsonce, I had the giftI could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now
How long has it been?
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
I have a wonderful new play!
A share of the profits.
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
How?
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
it will be all right, madam.
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Will! Have you finished?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
I did not.
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Nobody. The author.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
By God, I wish I knew.
What do we do now?
Kit
Ethel.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
As a nurse.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
I have lost my gift.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Will!
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
I would not for the world!
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
You have opened the playhouses?
Who are you, master?
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
My lady!
I do not know how to undress a man.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
I know how to fight!
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
He is dead?
My hat?
Where did you learn how to do that?
Yes, sir.
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
And her voice? Like lark song?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
A man, my lord?
What do you think?
He made it clear.
No.
He couldn't get his car started.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
So who's going to do it?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I don't know.
Finished.
Who?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
Yeah?
About the mail --
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I don't know.
Well, is it?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
What?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
Who was it?
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- instead of what he is --
You see, they don't really know me.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Yes.
Now?
Did what?
What? What's wrong?
OK.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
That's not him.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
He can't stay up there.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
It's the only way.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
What?
Are you all right?
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
Don't you ever stop?
You were going to say something.
You mean I can have the room?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
Yes, absolutely.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Two hundred.
No.
No one. I promise.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Eh, I don't know.
What do we do here, David?
Exactly what I was --
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Yes, sir.
What happened to that guy?
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
It was some guy called Brian.
No. But he needs treatment.
The human condition.
You know about it?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
Offering it for debate.
Is it real?
I don't know, I think...
Don't you like her?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Maybe... why do you ask?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
We cannot go into this later.
My keys.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Thanks a lot.
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
She did?
Nummers.
What?
Whatever you say.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
What about?
No, I know.
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Oh, no.
You going to answer it?
Then it's not your problem.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
Hungry?
No thanks.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Why do you wanna know so bad?
What?
Yeah, it is.
No shit.
Yeah.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Right.
How is she?
They are?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
I guess not...
George!
Oh fuck, Norman!
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
So how's Norman?
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
... I don't get it done often.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Yeah?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Baby...
One of my few virtues is discretion.
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down.
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Jackie, can we --
You were great.
He still having parties?
Look who's talking.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
What's wrong?
-- we are?
I've got to leave?
Look about last night --
Well then what are you trying to do-
I don't know... Jackie?
God, there's Lester...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
What for?
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
I'm busy, man.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
That's too bad.
Hi, George.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
George, I don't --
George --
What?
How?
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You're great.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Yeah.
George?
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Hey, I'm, you know --
Yeah.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
George.
I already said hello.
About what?
Going where?
Right now?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Who?
What business meeting?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Television or movies?
Well that's something.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
What? What? What? What? What?
I wish you'd go now.
That's all you've got to say?
What did you say?
What did you say?
What're you here for?
No.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
In a way. But...
But what?
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
-- yeah?
Well... who are those guys?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
I wanna hear about it, George.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Me!
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
I mean, how did that happen?
She's nothing but a whore.
No --
You really think so?
What took you so long?
No.

No you won't.
I was too old.
Yes.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Here.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Who are they?
Jackie Shawn.
See you later.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
-- No. No really.
Nothing.
I thought you said things were great with George.
But you have problems?
I'm exaggerating.
Jackie --
What?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
I'm terribly sorry.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
No!
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
How's it going, Doc?
Yes, Dad.
What?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Yes, Dad.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Chocolate.
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
What about Room 237?
Yeah, I guess so.
Jack...
Mom?
Yes?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't make any noise.
Because he hides.
Do I have to?
Please...
Tony.
It's okay, really.
Advocaat is it?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
I did?
Hi, babe.
Perfect for a child.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Any ideas yet?
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Yes.
Jack!
I don't know.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!
I just want to go back to my room.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Wendy give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Yes?
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
can of itself be a problem.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
I'd better collect my family first.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Sure, Uncle Al.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Yes. Go away.
Please, Uncle Al.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
Rats...
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
No.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Your mom's not around, is she?
What?
Do I need one?
I don't get you.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Yeah... sure.
What the hell does that matter?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
It could have been anything, Marty.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
I saw what I saw.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Really.
What about crack?  You a user?
You know what we're saying!
He's... dreamy.  He's...
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
How are you doing.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
His ashes?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What did who say?
Vince...
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
No... it's fine.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
This prom is a real drag.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Oh my! 
Where did that come from?
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Why?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Hold on.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Chops?
What is it, Mary?
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Pay attention...
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
I knew that.
What?  What time is it?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
You have to help me
What?
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
I'm getting experience.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mary Clarence!
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Very well.
St. Anne's?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Sit down.
It has come to pass.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No problem.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
A what?
No food?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Your cell is more than adequate.
What's wrong with my life?
I got it.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
In English?
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
So... hi there.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
What?
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
Out of the question.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
But -- why?
I must go where I can be of use.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
But...
What are you doing here?
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
So I don't shop.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
I just need a few more weeks,
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I have?
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Hail, Mary.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
It's a bluff, Vince.
It's done?
Not... totally.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
We've got to save her!
Sister Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
An... entertainer?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Not a note.
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
She's... she's a nun.
If we could speak alone.
Who took the meat?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Certainly not.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Excuse me?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
It is sacrilege!
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Your superiors are two days away!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Chosen me?
And now Jonathan Masbath.
What is that you wear?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I'm sure I don't know.
What kind of nuts?
We should not go much further in this murk.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
We should go.
Man or woman?
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
What can we do?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Are you so superstitious?
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Why would you do such a thing?
Must I hear this?
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
I... I can't do this.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
I know you saw me.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
There was not much blood, was there?
The Horseman.  Yes.
Go home.
She is guilty.
No.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Thank ye.
You got any money?
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Can I see him?
Did you decide, sir?
What you got that's good to eat?
French-fried potaters.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Leave.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
You like that Vaughan?
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
What numbers do you punch?
Why? Hi, Karl.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Are you well?
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Why did he do that, reckon.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
Hey Karl, you off work?
Where'd you get them flowers?
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
You want to go with me?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
He ain't no count.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
A little ol' boy.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
What you readin'?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
You walk fast, don't you?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
You better go get 'em.
Naw.
I reckon.
My history.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
We sure like havin' you.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Do you have family here?
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I've heard it said that way.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
No, we have to get this story.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Yes sir.
No thank you.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
Before they were married?
That's really strange. What does it mean?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
I didn't mean that.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
What!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
It's my birthday.
And what are you, his chaperone?
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Jesus, what happened to you?
What happened?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
And what about for you?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Do me a favor, will you?
What's that, Sol?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Yeah, I did.
How'd you get started?
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
What do you mean?
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Anything good?
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Did you ever go back to see her?
She probably died.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
Eighteen and a half years.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
She looks just like you.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Bully for you.
What's this?
For keeps.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
There's just one thing I want to know.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
What is this, some kind of joke?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
It'll never be finished.
And these?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
Thanks for the tip.
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
And his parents?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
And you told your nephew about it?
I figured he had a right to know.
And?
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Well?
Well what?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
I didn't expect to see you again.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Are you going to be all right?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
I just did.
His only copy?
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
And started to run.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
That money is my whole future.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Hi, kid.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I did.  But the jury won't s...
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Robbed.  He was angry.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
You said three minutes.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Well, why does it?
That's when he fell.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
And what's that?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Apparently.
And her farmhouse...?
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
Is it possible?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
I already said that, b...
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Not in those words.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Okay, doll.
I suppose you want a tip?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Get lost, will you?
Beat it, Buster.
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
I beg your pardon.
Funny?  In what way?
Those two musicians from the garage!
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
You're right, Joe.
Of course I am.
No we're not.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
With you.
You mean it's a girls' band?
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
You've flipped your wig!
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
DAPHNE?
Down, Daphne!
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Fight it.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
I got pinched in the elevator.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Have I got things to tell you!
I'm engaged.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Like when?
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Sugar?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I'm not that sick.
I'm fine.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
His yacht?
I'm a what?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
No!
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
No!
You like it?
Thirty-four.
Brand new.
I was it.
- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You invest in shows?
You're not sure?
I'm not surprised.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
You must be quite a girl.
Who?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Another bridesmaid?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Oh?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Why?
No - funerals.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Running away?  From what?
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
That so?
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Your view of what?
No, my flag steward.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Well, I'm not.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Why?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Shell Oil?
Would you mind moving along, please?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
You heard her - yes.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
What a beautiful fish.
What is it?
I don't mind if I do.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
What thing?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Talk about sad.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Well - ?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Tomorrow night?
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Why?
I cut myself shaving.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
What for?
I should get going.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
Fred Astaire and whats her face!
Still--
Say something. Please.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
I had to say something to get you here.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Mmm.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
No, count it, anyway.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
What is?
A weekend?
What?!
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
Come on.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You didnt have to do that.
You want me to let him in?
Hi, kiddo.
Its complicated, Dad.
What do you say to that?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Is he here in Borderdale?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
What he talk 'bout?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
And so you did your job, right?
Go on...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Hi, Daddy...
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Mornin', son...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
You hurt, Daddy!?
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Miss Boatwright --
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
What is it, David Lee?
Poor creature...
Can't sleep?
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Yes, mam...
Did you find your father?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's that you carryin'?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Is he gon' be gone long?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Whatcha wanta order?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
How's the weather out there?
What did he want?
Well, let's get to work!
I just got out here!
Where you goin'!?
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Doggy.
Montana.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
What is this?
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Suck my balls.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Come on, just get to the message board!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Did you bring the pie and punch?
What Cartman?!
Mph rmph rm!!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Eric, that is not appropriate.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
The N word?
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Kyle?!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Who are you, kid?
Viva la Resistance.
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Ber dada!
Uhh...
Mph mph.
Mrph?
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Who is it?
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Guess.
Uhh... Bacon.
That's gonna take a long time!
What's a butfor?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
That was sweet!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
This is sweet!!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Oh, brother.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Huh?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
I'm needing lunch.
The F word?!
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
What's going on Terrance?
AGH!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Hey, relax guy!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Getting drunk is no solution.
I think we're moving.
Well I appreciate that.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Where the hell did you come from?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
So, are you on for the next one?
Why, didn't they say?
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Is that clear?
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
I don't know what we're facing.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Dawn!  Dawn!
Take this flare.
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
I'm about to blow the wall.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
Will you marry me?
Marry you?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
What is happening around here!!!
Where's Taylor?
I'm going back for Taylor!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
I guess so.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
How am I supposed to know?
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Baby, take it easy.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Is it safe for human transport?
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
Find your bowler?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Can I get you something for the road?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Three whips. To go.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
I hate fuckin' opera.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
It's a beautiful thing.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
What's it look like to you?
I do what I gotta do to survive.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I gotta survive.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Hello, mom?
I found dad.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
I don't like to talk about it.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
What did you do to Buzz?
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Junior.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
What ever happened to just bowling?
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
This is a vicious cycle.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
Why were you suspended?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
What's plan B?
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
So why do you stay?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
It?
We would have sooner or later.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Very professional.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
I'm not here to bowl.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
Get out of there!
I can't see...
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Wait a minute --
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Yeah.  I heard you.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
But she's --
What do we use for defense?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Where is it?
Don't do it, Norman!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Captain.
A thousand feet.
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
What is it, Norman?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
What do you mean, he's missing?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
It's not sucking, sir.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Yes, sir.
They've left, keep watching!
How much damage?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
What?
So how do we get it open?
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
What's the message?
What?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
To what?
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
What is that?
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Resetting the sub.
I love secrets.
Wait -- down where?
Underwater?
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Beth.
Norman.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Don't do this.
Don't bother me, Norman.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
What's the matter?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Still clear?
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
We must've had it delivered then.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
You don't believe me.
Manifested?
He translated it wrong.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
I don't know.
How can the sphere do that?
Diphenyl parlene.
It's for motion sickness.
Valdomet.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Riordan?
Parasolutrine?
It's a soporific.
It's like a sleeping pill?
How long does it last?
Doesn't say.
I'm sorry.
Not believing you.
The sphere looks different.
Your watch.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
He can't manifest.
You think I manifested the snakes?
Someone did.
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
That's when you went in the sphere.
But I have to, Norman.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
Beth?
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
I --
Would it work?
Well, what's your theory?
For who?  The fish?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
We can refuse to talk.
C'mon, Norman.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
What noise?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
Getting anywhere with those?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Did I?
Harry?
What happened to her?
What is it?
I don't think so.
I can't reach her.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
There is one possibility.
You mean forget?
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
But it's impossible.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Captain who?
What report?
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Huh?
What report?
Who's everyone?
This is like nursery school.
Well, he's polite.
What was it?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
I'll get the information.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
We'll be back before you are, old man.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
What's wrong?  What's happening?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
What about the princess?
The Kiber Crystal.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Here come six more... grid two!
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
You don't believe in the Force?
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
I think she's going to be all right.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Mobile Infantery rules !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Sir, no, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Did you read her mind ?
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
I don't believe it !
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Funny...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Carmen...?
I'm sorry, Carmen.
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
Eeuch !
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
He's nothing like you.
Are you the boy for me ?
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
...I'm sorry.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
What ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Guess you gotta go.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Flip six, three hole.
Cover me.
It stinks, you goin.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Looks like rain.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Mr. Rasczak.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Sir, thank you, sir !
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Can you walk ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
What is it, Rico ?
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Yes.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Yes.
May I ask Why?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Was he difficult?
'Commander' Decker?
Mr. Spock?
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
What should you have known?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Then you'll be wet.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
I quit.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Of course.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Hello.
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Hi.
Read the card.
Why?
You believe that?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
<u>Please</u>...
What?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Is it...
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Now you're talking...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Not without a rolltop desk.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
Morning, darling.
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
After Drama Group.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Yes, that's right.
Ten thousand dollars.
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
I've been thinking.
I'm sorry.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Big day last night.
Well, where do they hold court?
They're holding it for ransom.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...they run on water.
Fourteen year old girls.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Bobby, don't say anything.
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Are you all right...?
Her...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
<u>Bobby</u>...
Joe, the writer?
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
I've always seen that.
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Of course he...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
No.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
I just...
I can't do it, Walt.
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
We, we have to give it.
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
The minute I read that script I said...
...yes...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
I'll put the, in your r...
You show Claire these sketches?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Doug, the traffic light...
I have to talk to you.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
He saw the girl in the car...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Grace...
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
Hi!
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
You can't write it?
I didn't say anything to them.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I don't...
What is that...?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
That's what I said.
It's just a formality.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
...not at all...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
George, that is so kind of you.
It takes all kinds.
Bet you did.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I hate when you say that.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Like a big sister.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
Actually.  I could only help him.
Not with my mouth open.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I'm not.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Here.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
What if he's kidnapped?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
Great.  Big ears, too?
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
You do NOT run out on your moth...
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Queen of diamonds.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Yes...if you like big hair...
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Okay.  These are good.
Rache says it's from you.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
That's necessary, huh?
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
Which part of no don't you understand?
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
I'm worried.
Me too.
Our children.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
WE are over.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
What did you do?
Look, I...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I have a snoop.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Anxiety.
Jackie?
Yes?
I don't know wh...
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Did I hear the word...
You bet you are.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Moi?
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
Oh, my God.
She's devastated.
And you said...?
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
Thanks for coming out.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
What do I have that you don't?
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Look.  I know they hate me.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
I think so...What do you think?
It's just an assignment.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Why in the world would she t...
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
I needed some time away.
I told her I loved her.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
That's not us.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Hey.
Hey. What's up?
You know...Stanley...
Oh.
No prob. I'm cool.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Thank you.
Great to be here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Four brothers and five sisters.
It was God's will.
I did not go to high school.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
You have a bay?
Oh. How did it happen?
So whaddya think?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
The camerawork's nice.
This is definitely better.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Don't even joke about that!
We used pull.
We did the same thing last year also.
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Reconceive.
What DO you know?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Hey, Mikey!
Hi, Dad!
You're not.
That's good.
It's over there.
...gger.
Nigger.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Again!!
No, not really.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Hello?
Who is this?
But...you called.
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Yeah. But not any more.
Huh. Kids?
Great. How old are they?
Eight, six, and four.
Yeah, sure.
OK. Bye.
Thanks.
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
You want some?
You a pervert?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
I'll lead.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
What do you mean?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
Well Cooper...
How well do you know this place?
Are the labs in operation?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Where does it lead?
Enjoying the tour so far?
I insist...
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
What do you mean?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Agreed--let's move it.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Dissent?
If I don't get power up we are!
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
At his office in the Capitol.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
What are you talking about, Major?
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
What about the President?
That's government property, Major.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
General Schmuck?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Yes, sir.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
You're right, sir.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
That is correct, Major.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I suppose they are, sir.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I'm trying to, sir.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
Right.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
They're coming in now.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Yes?
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Have you tried the recall again?
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
General, stick to the point, please.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
What else could it be?
Then this is it.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Just the missiles.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Yeah?
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Primary arming switch.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
I've got one.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
What's your point, Lothar?
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
How do you know he's dead?
Recall what mistake?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Look, this is different.
But I get a red light.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
Let me check.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
At the bottom of mines?
But who would be chosen?
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
We are?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
That was really great.
Uh, home, you know.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Hey, you said you did a video?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Sounds like a bummer.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
And your mom.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
It's your birthday?
Yeah.
Don't let 'em fight.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Okay, okay.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Go!
Fuck it!
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Hey, man.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...
What?
She's dead?
Guess not.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
It's okay.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
I could.
Okay.
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Mm.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
What was your name again?
Deep down. Way down.
Taking care of business.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi.
It's coming along.
He's drunk.
Tim, what are you talking about?
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
What? What'd you do?
Well, w-what happened?
What'd you do?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
They let you out?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Why we're just standing here.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
Oh! Trim it!
I hate that.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
I would've stopped it.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
What?
I, yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
The prom. That's funny.
So how's college?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Really?
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Well, not exactly.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Hey, where's Erica?
Camel jockey.
Look, get down off my property.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
I hope you're happy!
Look at you!
Oh!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
It's pretty exciting.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
You do not!
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
You do not want me to do your cover.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
I can't believe you're still here.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
You know, my mom has this saying.
Yeah?
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Tim?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Just one?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Leave him alone, Tim.
The fuck not?
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Another sex dream?
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Diane?  Diane!
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
You sure?
And they get caught!
... I don't know.  Probably not.
Hi, Jack.
Spit from your dad?
Yeah.
Y'think?
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
Oh... What are you working on?
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Shut up.
Don't use big bills!
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Hannah, we've...
Really...
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Your help.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
I didn't mean to --
I hear she was a terror to work with.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Roll 'em.
Hi, Artie.
Give me your coat.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Nothing for Ladd?
Name dropper.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
If I could be of any help...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
As for instance?
Well....
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Are you hungry?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
I'll make it short.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
We're engaged.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Who's who?
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
I don't want it now.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
If you love me, Joe.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
Or shall I call my servant?
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
You're a writer, you said.
Are you or aren't you?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Well?
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
December twenty-first.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
It's getting kind of late --
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
What scene?
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
They've come for my car.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
The other guests?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Keep it.
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
I made your bed this afternoon.
This room has not been used for a long time.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Is that so!
I'm not here.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Bring something to drink.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
But what will happen?
What does it mean?
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Why did she have to show up now?
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you want?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
When can I see, you again ?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
We have to have a long talk about all this.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
Let me kiss you.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
I sort of like what you said.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Wait. Don't leave me.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Well, there's several ways to go .
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
I bet they do.
What is it?
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
I know it.
I don't want your help.
No!
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Guess! Go on.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Why George, are you proposing?
Oh, no thanks.
Yes.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What are you making:
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
How'd you do that?
But what for?
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
I have to talk to you.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
Are you happy, Zaltar?
That horrible woman!
But it's impossible.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
What?
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Not enough vodka in it.
Brad.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
Who?
You...um...you never got married?
I can never get a way from it.
Call me.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Uh-huh.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Well...  Not quite like this.
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
What are you doing?
Thirty-five.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
First paycheck?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say what?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Man, what is this?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
What?
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Is this blackmail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
You designed it?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
What will it do?
Yeah? How's it look?
Stone mutha.
Can you do that?
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
There's no rush.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
But the other night...
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
How would you know?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Oh, Superman!
53.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
She's not his mama either.
We already have a super-tanker.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
What's wrong?
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
He's the only one who can operate this --
Yes! This time we got it right!
Anybody been hurt?
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Where were you?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
I didn't think I wanted to.
We'd better talk.
I'm listening.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
"They?"
Lois, I really don't see why --
You do?
Uh...home...
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Why?
To ski?
Superman! The --
You must be freezing.
So --  I hope you like it.
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Who is this . . . Superman?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
What shall we do now?
Look, they need a machine to fly.
Yes?
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
I really don't think . . .
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
No Paris?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
And what do we get out of it?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Awesome!
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
I think he's kind of cute.
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Albert!
Me?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Mom...
Keep warm now.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Hey!
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Screaming
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
This??
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Nuts. He made it.
Bet he makes it.
Damn!  This will get him.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Krypton!
You're happy, aren't you?
What do you suggest, my dear?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Ready?
You?! How about me?
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
You got wax in your ears?
I mean the other one!
What other one?
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Then -
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
He sure as heck does that.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
-- as we will be.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
He'll be weightless.
Enjoyed it?
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do you like pink?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
On radio waves?
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
And what does he do again?
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
She didn't.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
What happened?
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Say hi to Zoe.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
Billy, please.  The children.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Why?
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Why did you do that, Billy?
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
For rabbits?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Berry-picking.
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
Yes.  He does.
You've talked to Billy?
I did.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
I didn't say that.
Away from your crazy Mom.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
That's right.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Yes.
I don't want you to lie.
You seem very sure about that.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
When?
That's the local bar?
What do they do?
Crafts.
How old is she?
Is this it?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
Yes.
That's not news, Zoe.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Is there shrimp on it?
Who are you?
You think someone else caused the accident?
So you're just the thing we need.
Are you expensive?
What time in the morning was this?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Why were you scared?
Yes, I understand.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
Why not?
That was great.
You're going to blow everyone away.
What took so long?
Do you like the colour?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Will the police do anything to her?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Is it news to you?
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
Uh huh.
When?
How?
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What does that mean - integrity?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
He goes out with girls.
What about?
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Back?
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Why me...?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I didn't do anything!
J.J., if you think -
I tried to reach you twice -
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Why did you call me?
Steve, I...
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
Do you have bandages?
My God.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Radical.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Swear.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Smile?
Alriight!!  My man!
This is tactically dangerous.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
I'm sorry, John.
Easy money!
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I love you.  I always will.
Kyle, don't go!
Can it be destroyed?
Is it safe for them here?
Are you afraid?
Relax now, Sarah --
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
Yesterday I read that Furtwngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
You bet.
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
I have a duty.
You do shorthand and typing?
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
What's in those files?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
What is this, Emmi?
What's not right?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I made no deal!
I don't buy that.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
No!
Von der Null?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Do you know what's in this archive?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Yes.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
First oboe.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Alright, the beige one.
What's it to ya?
That's none of your business.
Do you understand?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
Just let me go.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
You cold?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
We gotta get you to a doctor.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
What's he like?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
That's where we're going.
Molecular-memory.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
What's that?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I want it to be over for you.
Not possible.
Don't say that.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I don't think I like this.
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Here, drink some of this...
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
I can't sleep.
Give me the short version.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Send a unit.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
You don't talk to me like that.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Oh, God... !
This is nuts.
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
What are you talking about?
Don't even think about it.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
You first.
You pull me up.
This is C.R.S.
They'll love that.
Where are we going?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
You?
No!  I'm sick of this...
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
Who are "they?"
That's a lie...
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
What did you say?
Scams, con games.  How many?
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What... what do you mean?
They won't...
Guess you missed it.
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Stop talking...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
I didn't know what else to call you.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Julliard, yeah.
Yes.
They'll be wanting it back.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Really?
Trust me.  Call that number.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Like a stroke?
Tell me you'll call.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
What have they been doing to you?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
How do you know?
Really?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Split it?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
There's nothing to forgive.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
What's all this for?
A game?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Where?
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
I've been so lonely.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Hey... !
Nicholas...
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
You're joking.
He hasn't called back.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
That could have been worse.
Why?
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
And those are Luke's and mine.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
You used the wrong test.
It's still an electric shock!
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
I, I just can't...
Eleanor, how was the drive?
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
Yes.
It was a stupid thing to do.
I don't know.
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
No.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Is she asleep?
She needs help.
Oh!  You scared me.
Who?
Mrs. Dudley.
It's all I could afford.
No.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I love this house.  I really love this house.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
Maybe you did it yourself.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Not for you, clearly.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
We think?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Oh really?  Where you from?
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Edward Rama?
Eduardo.  Rama.
I didn't expect anyone.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
You're kiddin' me, right?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
You goin' back inside?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
That would be too easy.
Uh-huh.
You just cooking then?
Perhaps it was the smoke.
What was that, then?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Not embarrassed.
Modelling.
Footloose and fancy free.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
-- Your employer?
What line is he in.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Not that I recall.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Up the coast.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Eh?
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Where is he now?
You sure?
No kidding.
I got half.
Yeah.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
Like what.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Since when?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
What.
Tell you ...
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
Hello, Ed.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
But more or less.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ah... it's nothing.
Huh.
...I wanted to make you happy.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
And how do we share--
I'll have it in a week.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Yeah.
It's OK.
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
That'll be fine.
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
How's business, Dave?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...You know... who *who* is?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Oh, Jesus.
Your place?
...Dave?
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
Just coffee.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Honey.
You don't have to--
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
How did you get into the store?
Yeah.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...who among us is in a position to say...
No thanks.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Jesus...
Uh-huh.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Frank.
Huh?
Whuddya mean?
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
OK.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
He's a barber.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Yes.
I don't want to scare people.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
What happened to them?
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
What is it?
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
I hope you liked it.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Yes.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
Quiet!
What is it?
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Shut them up!
Stop!
Margo, you haven't heard?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Eats them?
How about lunch?
How does it work?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
You were going to be married.
How did you know that?
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
What happened?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't understand.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
Where would we find it?
Dr. Green...
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
Genetic damage?
Wounded?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
The planetarium!
We have to try and draw it off!
How?
We're not going to make the storage room!
I don't believe it.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I can't!
Viti Levu.  For how many?
One.
<i>A month.</i>
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
What's to see?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
Cue music...
What music?
He doesn't care.
Thank you.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
Amnesia.
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Who are you?
Why not?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
No.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Yeah, what happened?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Your Dad?!
No.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Oh, God.
Good night, Mother.
What's the hurry?
Arrah!
--we need more charcoal.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
You're the one talking to the walls!
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
It looks so small.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
You got it.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
You've been back to Dallas?
Yes.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Of what?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
How's that?
I know the name. Why?
Who sent you?
And what's that?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
You know my work?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
What was it?
-- You saw this experiment?
I've been using you?!
I'm on the roof.
Now what?
No you didn't.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
...thirteen fifty six...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Why?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
I don't know.
Mulder --
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
What?
This virus -- it... 
What do you think it is?
This is weird, Mulder.
You hear that?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
On whose orders?
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
About the conspiracy?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
Why are you telling me this?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Let me out. Stop the car.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
More concerns than that?
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
He hates me.
She adores you.
Miriam...
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
I'd be there for him.
Sing a song of sixpence.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
I realize that...
Do you think that's funny?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Agent Novak?
With Stargher I saw things...
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
If you believe that.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Little boy?!  That's him!
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
What now?
Agent Cole.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Intravenous administration complete.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Nervous?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
No.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
That's a secret.
What about the cat?
Here he is.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
I don't have to.
Do you understand German?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Yes.
...at all.
What's she talking about?
Harry?
Do I...
Tell me more.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Let's go away.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
...Headquarters.
How do you know?
That's the reason.
Joseph Harbin...
No.
He works in a military hospital.
You can help us.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I said another man was buried in his place.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
Just around the corner.
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
Holly Martins.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
...to him.
What are you trying to say?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Ever seen one?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
...expense.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
This is where he vanished.
Fifty yards right down there.
It wouldn't work.
Didn't I?
Win what?
Well, there's not much time.
It's a military hotel.
Very good, sir.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...his number.
I'll look it up for you.
You do!
I know a very good dentist.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
What about?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Who?
Striptease, sir.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
And - Anna...
You can get somebody else...
As long as they can use you?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
Coffee.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
...the best way one can, you know.
Are you mad?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Martins.
Coming to the point, please.
Find out?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Coffin?
Baron Kurtz.
You remember me? Upstairs...
...Popescu...
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
...give evidence.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Now, hold on.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Oh, you did.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Joseph Harbin.
...Mr. Martins?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Richard. Hi.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Bonjour.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
So?
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Have you told someone?
No.
Too far?
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
No one follows that midrash.
They only kill them when they love them?
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
What, do you like it here?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Oh, please...
What do you care?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
I have a job.
I don't care about money.
Which is what?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Are they still together?
What's he care about?
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
Who's Linda?
Where'd you get this?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
What's it mean?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
That's stupid.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Where are they?
Even though his dick is so big?
And belief follows?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
No. What are you looking for?
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I didn't realize you cared.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I thought there were people here....
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Why are you taking that?
More cultural than political.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
What about Curtis Zampf?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Why?
So you're saying it's not true.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
I can't help what I think.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
It was a nine millimeter.
I can't say that.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
Daniel Balint.
What are you doing here?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
What kids?...
You could do it.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Mrs. Moebius.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
You can't say that....
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
Howard Stern.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
They're not that Jewish.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Eat shit....
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
What do you mean?
You're going to live here permanently?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Are you going to keep it?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Did you tell him?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
The documents are forged.
No!
This is a great pleasure.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
What was he like, when he was little?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Is it a poem?
Jacques!  Johana!
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
Why?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
Noireuter.
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
No...
Great!
Why?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Well, what are they?
It's okay.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
No, no!
What?
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
... Everything.
Everything about what?
Two years younger than you.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Can I come in?
I don't want to erase anything.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
That's good.
I'm concentrating.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
A drink to warm up?
Tea... or whiskey?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Thank you...
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
How can you tell it's a female?
How do you know that?
I got fired.
So have I.  ... Hello?
No... tell me.
Absolutely positive.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
You'll try again tomorrow?
Why?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Promise me one thing.
What?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
Way past it.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Want to get a drink?
What was that!?
Mordechai?
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Cool. What's it do?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
I wasn't too over the top?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Is he in love with you?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
This is for "mama and the kids."
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
They don't say it to me.
Sure.
Sure, I like my leopards
I'm sick.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
Cut.
Something black - something on its way to you 
Rosita  I have wondered -
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
Come to look around?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
What do you do now?
Yes. The lipstick.
Why?
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so 
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
Get it out of here!
On his back, I suppose.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
No  not yet.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Must it?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Laurence!
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Mr Lombard...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
Black suits you.
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
Good.
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
...Were turning in circles.
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
To get me killed...?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
The word for those things is croissants.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
I cant believe this...  Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Italian? The Mafia...?
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
What sort have you got?
Yeah.
How much of a hurry are you in?
Where is the Austrian?
I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...
No... No...  I swear...
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Good.
La what?
Should I?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Its not.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Okay. Recommended...
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Any friends?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Problems?
Lets go.
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Is this Friedman?
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?
Ill be alone.
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
Can I get up now?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Who else knows about the boy?
Is she on the phone?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
... No.
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
No...
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Welcome to the club.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
What about his girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Could that be Camden Market?
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
O est pass ton salon?
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
Then why dont you reach him?
Why did you kill him?
I can only tell you what he told us...
What sums?
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
They lost their son. Why?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Cost what?
Whats that? A word?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Very generous of you all.  How much?
I also need someone who can read and write.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You make it sound so simple...
Tell me...
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
I -- I don't understand...
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Go onto the next question.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I can't read.
Quite a few.
And?
Why?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Yes, probably... maybe...
Arrest them!
Really?
What about you?
But where are you going to be?
Trial?  What trial??
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
And may I go to Mass?
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
You think?
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Get them out of here!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Is it long and hanging down?
Go on to the next question.
That's not a lot.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
For what?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
What's going on?
We need another ten minutes...
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Yes, it's a miracle.
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Yes.  We can pray.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
The clothes are not important...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
That's now what I meant...
Besides, what about these...?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
You don't believe me anymore?
Who gave you that horse?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
What are you doing out here?
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Why were you yelling like that?!
Why would they?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
In His name??
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Do you think this cross will protect you?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
I don't think so.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
You think you are ready now?
I need to confess again.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Is that bad?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
He never says his name.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
I'm going to get a doctor.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Have you seen this?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Who's recruiting?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
What are you reading?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Cow!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
You made contact?
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Where are you hiding?
In the attic.
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
On your property?
What for?
The piano.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Yes, why not.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
You mean in signs?
She wants to see what you can do.
What?
Hello, then.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
He's given it to us.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What do we do?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
You think my play is bad?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
If that's the way you want it.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
There's always a depression on.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Who's got the contract?
Yes sir.
What do ya want the others to get?
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
You sober?
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
You think he'll show?
No.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Then why you doin' it?
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
See ya and raise three.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
She coulda killed me last night.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
It isn't any better.
Where's June today?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
What time you get off work here?
You doin' anything tonight?
What does this guy want?
Looks like he missed ya.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
And you were gonna pay me back?
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
How am I gonna do that?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
You weren't hired to miss him.
For fifteen years.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He was?
Any luck?
Said he stole his invention.
Oh, Andy.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
And don't ever try to see me again.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Oh!
He's waiting for you.
Another Martini --
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.
Not that scrawny little....? 
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Don't lie to me.
Yes, she would.
A new invention?
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
You can take that out to the car.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What's that to you?
Who's is it?
You mean about that gun?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
You've been there?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about this Nunheim?
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
I see.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Goodbye.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
All right.  All right.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
I don't like him.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
That's my business.
Go ahead!
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Oh, please, Nick.
I trust you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
No.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
I see.  I see.
No word at all?
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
What do you think?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
I've never heard about you.
What's that?
You might have mentioned me first.
Pretty girl.
You got types?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Who's that?
Isn't that my drink?
What are you drinking?
She didn't tell me a thing.
No thanks.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Who gave it to you?
You did.
Aren't you hot in that?
Did I give it to you?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Let's see.  Where's it from?
I don't know.
Sit down!
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
He's just been for a walk.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
Back to California
Nick!
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Well, don't they?
How long has he been dead?
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi...
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I don't know.
It's the only way it makes sense.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Yes.  Nick!
I know I left them there.
I just wanted to tell you...
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
What kind of mine?
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
We can't just go off and--
Not much of a pass.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Where'd they go?
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Missile!
What am I supposed to do?
Maybe we should split it up now.
You got no reason to do that!
Stop it!
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know that.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
At-at-at-at-at.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Take the binoculars.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Steady it out!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
What?
What do we do with the Humvee?
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What!?
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Where you going?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
I don't hear any--
Don't!
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
They're going to kill us!
If they land--
What are you doing?
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Must be a compartment.
Wait.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
We'll find our way.
Yeah.
What do you think our chances are?
No!
Don't you touch it.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
Slip out your M-16.
And then what?
An Iraqi?
What do you make of them?
Is that good, or bad?
The...the gold...
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps.
What?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Some good ones.
A headache?
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Yeah, you're funny.
Like I said; so?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
What?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Iraqis.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
You down?
Maybe we should give him some water.
I think he wants something to drink.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Drug evasion with....
HUMMMM.....
Vocasity
Now.
I have to... he's a G-34
What are you doing?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
I've got it!  Astounding!
What?
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
When?.....How?
What?
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
I knew him.
That's not it.
Yes...
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Hey, that's the guy-
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Hey, look--
Oh yeah? Prove it.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
This is where the van was parked.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Right.
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Which one's which?
I terrible with mechanical things.
What's up?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Something round, two wires ...
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Drop it.
You touch me again and--
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Vice... Jesus.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Make an appointment.
P.E.T.N ...
A what?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Captain...
What's this?
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
About tonsils.
No.
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
But--
Umm.
Nice suit.
Yes, Baron.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
I hope you find the figures correct.
I hope so, too.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
Yes, m'sieu.
Good day, Doctor.
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Disappointed?
No, thank you.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Five, seven, and nine--
yse seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Correct. Now the train leaves--
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doa Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Lily-- 
Yes.
Yes.
You like that statue?
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
That's too dark.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Beautiful specimen.
Oh? 
This used to be my secretary's room.
You think that's too much?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
I'll be delighted.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then riding together.
Then a little nap--
How do you like my dress?
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Yes, Gaston?
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
<u>Adolph</u>?
It could have been marvelous ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Two lumps, madame?
For all the really important things--
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Then why did you do it?
Yes, my bag!
But you saw it here.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Rush her.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
There's a satellite call for you.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
Rose Calvert.
None of the stewards have seen her.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
An accident?!
I was tired.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You're precious to me, Rose.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
You're a good liar.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
The boats are all going.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
How cold?
HELP! HELP!!
Hello again.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Well, here you are.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
No, no! Just with her hands.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
I don't know the steps.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Jack, I --
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Now it's worse.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
It's so cold.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
April 14, 1912.
You think she was really there?
Would you like anything?
Just tell us what you can --
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
This is Miss Marsh.
I'll join you later.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
No-o!
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Aces full.
Could I see you a minute?
No gentleman would do that.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
You've got lipstick all over you.
This is Mr.--er--
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Isn't she attractive?
Okay.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
But--
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You mean that?
What?--
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I could see you were pining away--
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
What do you know about them?
Make it five.
Well, I'll be--!!!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Inspector McKinney.
Are you screwy?
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
What is it?
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
How about you?
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I should say not.
Here you are, sir. 
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Send that.
That's me!
Yes--Me--in person!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Who won?
I was never stiffer in my life.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
I didn't--
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
Very serious?
Why--don't you like him?
Meaning what?
What's the matter, Mary?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Get that out of your trunk.
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
Why don't you leave me alone?
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
No!
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
There you are, sir.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Sure, Sis.
I'm all right.
Ain't got time.
Then why did you run away?
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
He said to turn loose of him.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
I'm retired.
Come on, you...
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Ecentus stultorum magister.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
You don't even know him.
Since when is faro a business?
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Very cosmopolitan.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
Doc...
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
How you feelin', Doc?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
A which?
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
Good God, you're really-
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Easy now... That mare's in season.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
You'd die for fun?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
What's wrong?
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I hate Sadie.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Oh, all right.
No really, I can stay a while.
Mattie.  What about this?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
That what you got me up here for?
Forget it, Ringo.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
But this time they'll be ready.
It's that woman from the coach!
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Get down, boy.
I just got it fixed.
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
That a fact?
We should get moving.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
...Words to live by?
Briefly.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Where can I find him?
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Q! How are you?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
I see...
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Natalya?
Can you arrange a meeting?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Where to now, Jimbo?
Interesting presentation.
They point, I shoot.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
I'll keep that in mind.
Nice to run into you again.
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
What?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
He's killed closer.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
If not?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
And when might that be?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
Of course.
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
Sabotage?
... And what do you call these?
Stop it!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
What's your name?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Yes -
What's wrong?
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
What did your wife get her?
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
You were in hell?
Who is it?
I'm going back home with Harry.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I'm busy.
It is just a regular card.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
No, I'm too hot now.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
I'm worn out.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
How is the garden doing?
Since this morning.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
I was just trying to make conversation.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Whadda ya think?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Can I help pump the gas?
What?  What is it?
Woody!  Buzz!
We're almost there.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Yes, I can.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
What's going on?
I could have stopped him.
Trouble?!  Where?!
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Spaceship.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
Don't tell me what to do!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Come on, this way!
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Well, thanks for the ride.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
I don't know!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
This is ludicrous.
W-w-w-we?
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Woody?!
But you're Irish!
He made that. In his off hours.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
You're not so old yourself!
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
So did I.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
Why does he need money?
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Carl --
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
This is different.
How long have you known?
Barbara --
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Where are you going?
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Did you tell Dad?
Just watching you.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Helena --
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Yes.
How are your grades?
What's that mean?
What is this, like freebase?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Have you done your homework, honey?
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
That's a big word for a fisherman.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
Depends on the state.
Arizona.
Yes.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
When will you do it?
They're going to walk right past me.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Yes, sir!
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
That's good coke.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
What's he doing up here?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.
It's possible.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
Any idea how much?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
I got money.
Oh, man --
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do you mean?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'm sorry.
Bit fucking late, like.
I'll be right after you.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
For fuck's sake.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Can you not go yourself.
Jesus.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Diane.
Eh-
Ssshh!
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
No, not holding hands.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Easy for you to say.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Oh, really?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
That's nice.
Now remember --
Right.
And you might get the fucking job.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
It was my fucking television.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
What?
So?
That's tough.
No, I don't think so.
Your favourite dish.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Sure.
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
That's fair enough.
We go for a walk.
What do you see as your main strengths?
Homeless people?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
No, no, it's not possible.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
What's going on?
Bob?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
MM.?
Oh, God
What are you doing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
I do not often think of the past.
Who is it he reminds you of?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Captain, what have I done -
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I did not.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Is what possible?
A "t."
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
Now learn something about yourself.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
The ship needs its Captain.



And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
I hide no pain.
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok, we must find a way...
You invented Space Paranoids?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
How's it going upstairs?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Okay, okay...
I want to go to his place.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yeah...?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
What do you mean, "'yes"?
That all you can say?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I'm sorry -
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Who is your User, program?
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Flynn!!
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
What about our friend - Sark?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Feel what? You okay?
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Thank. you, Master Control.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
A User?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
What do you think?
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
What is it?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Nice...
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Where are you going?
You seem fine now.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
You're kidding.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
I thought you moved out.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Copy that.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Guy's a spook!
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I thought this look like your work.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
My husband is a good man.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes.
Yes what?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
They must've just missed me.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
And you agreed?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
I can do it!
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
What did he give you?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
What?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
What are you going to do?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Boris and Doris?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Yes.
Tell me what happened?
To our assignment.
What is it you need me to do?
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Who is this woman?
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
How come?
Tell him we gotta go.
Has he looked through it yet?
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Sonny kicks ass.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What do you want to know?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Burt Reynolds.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Almost four years.
At the movies?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
What would make you think that?
I love Janis.
She OD'd, didn't she?
So he really loved her?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
"Heroes For Sale"?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Write down Drexl's address.
Why?
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
I think what you did was...
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
How come?
What?
Cancoon.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
Naw naw!
Live with what?
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
He don't got no right to live.
I'm her husband.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Elliot what?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
What's to think about?
Two guys.
Clarence.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
No. But thanks.
How 'bout me what?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Elliot.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
What do you want from me?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Nope.
I give up. Who are you?
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Where'd he come from?
Sure was.
Not a tiny little vial -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
How the fuck could he know?
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
What was I sayin'?
Rock whores.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
You gotta hold this for me.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
No way, Jos.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
What was the Jew-boy's name?
We want you to tell us about last night.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
And your only goal is...???
So that...???
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Change what?
I need to go.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
You're afraid of germs?
What year is it?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
And I was in it?  What did I do?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
What's the matter with your leg?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
See -- you can drive after all!
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
The gun! ... I lost it
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
I don't understand what we're doing.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Why are we doing this?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
I need to make a telephone call.
I'm not crazy.
What are you talking about???
What....???
What...???
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
But you know what's real now?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
He was fully sedated!
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
What...virus?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
He no!
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Any parting words of wisdom?
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Nothing.
That's my morning's pay.
It is not.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Where to?
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You Harlin?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Hey!
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Hundred-fifty.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
You've been there?
I want my car.
You got beer?
What was that all about?
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
What do you want?
Wrong number.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What does it look like?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
No, I've got it.
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I just drove in this morning.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Least you can leave.
Nice place you got here.
What do you do anyway?
A medicine man?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You just walk away.
Yeah.
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
What are you talking about?
What about us?
Stop it.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
I don't know.
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
To get my car.
John . . .?
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Well, nothing.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I think I busted my leg.
I'm here.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Wait a second--
Hey!
How do you know if you've never tried?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You're talking like a mad man.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You love her, but you hate her?
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Jake--
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I came to kill her.
Liar.
Come on, Jake--
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
You're not talking sense.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
I asked you a question.
I want to stay.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
What?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
I wasn't doing anything.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Not as bad as it looks.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
What do you want for free?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
You afraid of the dark?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Christ, I don't believe this!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
What can I do for you, lad?
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
You're talking like a madman.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
That's a bit much.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
It's not what you think, Jake.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Cause she's dead.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You own this place?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
I want my car.
No.
Got any cold soda?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
No, I've got it.
Accident.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Thank you, Bobby.
You've been around.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
My face tell you all that?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Like you.
Still playing?
You know what I want.
Did you ever?
Is that why you're with him?
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Try me.
You mean the Shaman?
Yeah.
I'm sorry...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
In <u>cash</u>?
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
Grace ... Grace?
Good thinking.  What's all this?
I can't see it.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
I'm not sailing his boat.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Morning, officer.
Where ya goin'?
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
The old lady?
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
How much?
Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Let me get your change.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
Who was that on the phone?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Help me, Grace, help...
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
Yes?
Oh.
Wow.
Proceed.
Is Jeremy okay?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Oh shit...
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Are you for real?
Just give me a minute.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
Quick.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's kind of a miracle.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Why'd you do that?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
What things?
No.
You're lying.
Don't be scared.
He doesn't look very threatening.
How are you feeling?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
In the passenger car?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
...I got a present for you.
I fined 'em instead.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
Rain's coming.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
He said...
What'd he say?
I thought... you was an angel.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Free ones?
Shit and fried eggs.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
Mmmm pistols.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Uh... a little, maybe.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
He said that, huh?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
She's passed on, Kid.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
What business?
Get some sleep, Kid.
Finish him, Ned.
You missed him? You didn't...?
It's gonna get riper yet.
Say, Bill...
That was... the first one.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
Take a drink, Kid.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Huh?
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Three ways?
She gave me the evil eye.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Well, she...
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
You ain't like that no more.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
He hit you?
Beats the hell out of me.
HEY.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Jesus.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I seen him.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Hullo, paw.
Three.
The Kid, yeah...
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
K-k-kill somebody?
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
Fuck you.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
I don't like the question.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Jack. What are you doing here?
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
Goddamnit.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Umm ...
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
You are a criminal.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
Can we stealth these guys?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Get out.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Three million?
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
What is this?
What-are they speaking?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
Ready?
Who's your boss?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
What about Redfoot?
Mr. Soze will be most -
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
You're lying.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Who is he?
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Which is shit.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
He didn't have my lawyer.
You got him wrong.
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Then what?
What call?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Wait a minute.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I don't.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I never heard of him.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
Edie.
No...
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
Four cases in three years ...
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
... he wants to testify ...?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
I was her doctor.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Yes.
Yes!
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Through, through his book.
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
I . . ..
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
That's what I'd planned to...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
Dr. Gruber ...
I read the hospital report on your client.
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Right.  Who called?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Why is that?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Thank you for seeing me.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
I can't guarantee that...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Maybe I can do something right.
What...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
And it's over...?
Not if you don't grow up...
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
He's not in, Sir.
Hi, Mickey ...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
I have to talk to you.
I'm going to help her.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
What?
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
No.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
You got a good memory, Franky.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
You use their witness.
That's right.
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
Uh...the admitting nurse...
What did she do?
The 'History'...?
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... I know.  I went ...
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... I understand ...
How old is he?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
I used to be a nurse.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
A single hour.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
What happened in those three...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Huh.  And why is that?
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Then?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Ernie's.
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
What happened?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Do you live here in the hotel?
You're not far wrong.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
But you haven't lived here long.
About three years.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I want to know who you are.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
No? Then what?
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Judy --
I don't like it!
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
You can't. You're afraid!
Scottie, please...!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
What are you going to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
You don't remember.
No...
Please drink your coffee.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Wandering about.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Wander about.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
You've nothing to apologize for.
Good-bye.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
How can you be sure?
No birds live here.
Would you like a drink of water?
Long ago...
No!... No!
What do you remember?
What else?
Where?
How do you know?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Why? What's happened?
No, don't go away!
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Tell me.
Yes?! But --
You've been there before. You've seen it.
My love... because I love you.
Let me go.
Yes.
Let me go into the church alone.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Please answer my question.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Would you please go and look?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
More than you think.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
I know. Everybody tells me.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I've never run across one like that.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Normal.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
What.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Nothing to tell.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Midge!
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
What is it, a still life?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
How?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
How soon can it be altered?
Can we have it by tonight?
Jesus.
How ya doing?
What?
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
Why was the floor wet?
You're pathetic.
You're not a team player.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
And you're a little fucking reject.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
What are you talking about?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Are you sure this was an accident?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
I'm calling the police.
Bury her out in the desert.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
It has worked.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
They won't figure it out.
They're driving me nuts!
They're screaming for Starbursts.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
Have you thought about what I said?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
That's right.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's still working?
No I don't.
I got her arm.
What's goosed?
He just had two.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
Easy Boyd.
Boyd...What have we done?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Say it again.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
My what?
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
Not a prayer.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Israel doesn't have a King.
Not really, no.
You said nobody would miss her.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
How about my Fatburger?
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Can't we do it on the phone?
I think so.
What do you mean, you think so?
The wedding cake check?
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
Why?
He is.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
How much?
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Will you please call the chair people?
I will.
Do you love me?
I love you.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Hey. It's me.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No. Just like an hour or so.
The chairs.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I know.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Who's dead?
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
It's too late.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
But...
He's your brother.
I'll take a ride.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
What is it?
That ought to be about the end of that.
I have no idea.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Where's Boyd?
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
Did he try to kiss you?
I guess.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
What song?
"You Send Me."
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
We will.
Good times.
Fucking desert.
Shut up Micheal.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I'll come to you tonight.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Stop this, stop this.
Where's the camera?
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
How long are you staying?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
How did you know about that?
Yes, it is.
Never.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
Is it all right?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
How much is that?
And in the vegetable plot?
My God, what have you done to him!
She's mad.
You see how much you like her?
Kill him.
Well... is it so urgent?
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Yes. Why?
Is she coming back?
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
It's a very big one.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
I had so many things to think about!
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
When you are, miss.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Ask the priest, miss.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
I should have told him.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Only because I got pulled out early.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
It feels so.. .real.
How should I know?
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
You all right?
You ready for this?
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Real effective security...
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Lindenmeyer?
Sid?
Where the hell are you going?
Then shoot him already.
What do we do now?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
There you go  best seat in the house.
What are you talking about?
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
It's <u>producing</u>.
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
...The Albanian Campaign...
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
Who we got here...?
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
It won't hold.
What crisis?
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Tell, tell, tell me again.
....we landing?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
What's it gonna cost? 
...but...
...they sound what?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...can we see the Kitten...?
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
...take a long view.
...this's <u>good</u>...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
...fourteen years...
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...

He thinks it's too...
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"...

I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.

This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
Heavy weather East of here.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Ask it.
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that? 
It can be documented that he displayed the...
Is there a press conference today?
When's he coming back...?
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
What do you think would hold it off?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
They got to have something that we want.
...who is this guy...?
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
"Back End" ... count on it.
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
Yeah...?
In the Folk Music Section.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Mmm.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
The Albanian Campaign.
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
Uh huh...why?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
Why not?
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
...one more day.
What're you doing?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Watch me.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?

It's too clean.
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
I go with this here... 
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
See y'at the Finish Line.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
They look stupid.
Shoes, Hats....
Public Domain.
You like it?
Yes.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
A beret.
Why a beret?
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
Long's you git me back for the beans...
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Grand Marnier.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...if I had your looks, better.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
What's going on?
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
What brings you out here...
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
What if he asks where I got the money?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
So you're hot on this stock?
What was that?
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Oh no, no...
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
How do you know?
Know the name?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
I guess I'll head back...
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
What the hell do you want?
Why do you need to wreck this company?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
How much is enough Gordon?
You could have a great beach house for that.
I gather you're a decorator.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
What if I have a previous engagement?
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
Hi.
How you doing Buddy?
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
But?
What's that?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
Jenkins!
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Tony and China?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
That's not what you said last night.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
It's only two hours away.
That was very good.
No, he wouldn't.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
No.  But once I heard...
I didn't want to come.
Because he was worried about me.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
You think that'll help?
Yes, but...
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
I am.
How're you holding up?
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Who's that?
When...when will she be back?
Who?
Tell me.  Please.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
I've never even met you.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
What?
You must think I'm pathetic.
Mrs. Frank?
What's your name?
I don't know.
They're calling me in to work.
Stop.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
It's niiice.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
You think he killed her?
What?
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Did I?
Oh God...you knew.
Adamant?
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
I guess not.
Don't.
Whatcha reading?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Nope.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Maybe we should just...
Remember how we were?
But what if something happens?
I know.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
What are you doing here?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
You are so brilliant.
You're kidding.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Get down!  He'll see.
He killed her.
What?
A flare?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
I didn't do that.
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
Are you lonely?
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
Who did?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
We walked all night...
You don't remember?
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
...I'm positive this time...
Your wife...
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
I tried to break it off!
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
What?
Huh.
Don't think so.
I'm cooking you dinner.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Mmmuh...
Two what...?
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
A what...?
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Don't tell Rowan about this.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Nothing was ever more false.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
Hello...?  Who is this...?
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
What is it...?
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
She didn't feel them
Stop it!
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
There is no one here but the dead.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
I don't know what you are!!!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Yessss...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
you're very --- different.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Doctor's orders- - -?

We're quite a pair, you and I.
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Do you love me, Michael...?
You sure...?
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Mm-hmmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
No.    This is unreal...
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
I can't.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Wow...
Is that a crack about our singing...?
The one on the left - definitely...
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
And it can't be forged?
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
This must be one of the old keys -
Sure...
I lost the touch
What's with all the locks - and hammering
My names isn't ANGELA...
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Oh, about six years since I graduated
What did you do with her?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
I don't know...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
Why should I?
What?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
I don't like sugar
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
Well, what do you think?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Her husband left her
Yes...?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
You and your pep talks.
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
Were you always this sick?
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Dead?
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
So that's a maybe?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
The lesson being?
Of course we are.
Son.
Yeah.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
It's your car. These are all your cars.
That's me.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Who exactly ARE you?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Well?
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
I understand.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
My room?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
You want it in writing?
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Me-ow.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
In what sense?
Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Well? What do you think of her?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Where are we going?
He phoned it in.
I see.
I doubt it.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
It's incredibly simple.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
Well? Where the hell are you?
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
What about you?
I'm very aural.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Not a chance.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
Yellow pages?
That's part of growing up, honey.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
But who would run the store?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Me? The King of Coitus?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
I was like a different person tonight.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
What kind of ideas?
You think we should be more open minded?
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Bad news.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Talk to me Artie.
How you doing, Artie?
She's going to wash your Jeep?
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
About Suzie?
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
The skinny brunette.
Unless what?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
We all have...
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
About a year ago.
Why?
Where's this coming from?
What about witnesses?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
Yeah... okay... he did
What did you do then?
Ms. Toller?
This wasn't my idea.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
I say something funny?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Excuse me?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Kelly...
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Hello.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Say you love me.
It doesn't look like it.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
That's cop bullshit.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Get away from me.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
That was about as grim as it gets.
We?
How...
Shit. Here we go again.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
But don't pull that again.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Aha?
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Limestone quarry?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Jim, are you all right?
Well... that, too.
So... what happened?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Relax.  We're almost there.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
There's only seventy-eight.
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Really?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
You bring the best out in a man.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
This is Colonel Richards.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
He had a pressing engagement.
Dr. Pemberton?
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
You are very important, Willow.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Not today, Willow.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Say what?
Sorsha.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Why.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Are you okay?
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Did she ask about me?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
That's all I ever wanted!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Patience, Willow.
Get back here, Rool!
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
This is not going well.
Obviously.
Maybe milking.
Cows. You know, cows?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
What are you going to do?
Have you got your gun on now?
Amish.
What have you got?
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Johnny 
You have no right to keep us here.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
We do not go into your courts.
They kid a lot.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
No, no doctor...
But why?
Something wrong with buttons?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Where's the nearest telephone?
I know what he said.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
Aren't you? After today?
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
That's God's way!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Wrong.
I don't know where he is.
You didn't have to...
Who was that man?
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
He'll live.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
If she...
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
If any!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Oh --
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
I thought you said she was dead.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Toto, too.
Whenever you wish.
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
How did you guess?
Yes --
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh --
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
...bed.
Oh -- 
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh - I'll get it!
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Supposin' you met an elephant?
But why?  Why?
Oh, come on.
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
...don't talk.
Ohhh --
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
To Oz?
Oil can what?
Here -- here --
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Yes -- there --
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
That's right.
Where -- where do we go now?
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
It's a whatzis.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Where do we go now?
...Tin Man!
Quiet!
No, sir!
To Oz?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Let's.
Yes.
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.
No, you don't.
Yeah --
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well --
But I still want one.
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
So who are you?
Then its no longer a bomb?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Hes sealed himself in.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
Constructions not exactly my line.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.
The inside man?
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
How long has he been with you?
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
Oh my God...were buried alive...
Im coming with you.
Wheres M?
One... last... screw?
You, of course. I need some information.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
Where did you get this?
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
I thought you were the one in her business.
A rope!
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
Mother of God.
No! Bond!
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Someone will come.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
The bearer of bad news.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Because --
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
The missing scientists.
What??
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
What is it?  How does it work?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
What are you up to?
This'd better not be what I think it is.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Those cars.  What year is this??
Dan -- what do we do now?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I don't know their real names.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
What do I get out of it?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
Thanks.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
What game is that?
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
What do you get if you finish?
Go to hell.
Mind your business.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
We hung out last night, remember?
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
Aren't you afraid?
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Where's he headed?
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
The Peace conference...
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
Sit down.
What's the deal?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
What's this?
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
What's "Anarchy 99"?
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
I wish I could go.
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
Into the Hudson?
It's too far.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
I've seen a lot of rings.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
I do love a good check mate.
Now that's Magneto talking.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
What did she do to me?
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Is that so?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
It does indeed, Max.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Frederick Frankenstein?
No!
Yes, sir.
Carlson!
Yes, sir.
MMmmm.
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Yes.
Will you miss me?
Oh, nice.
Ready, darling?
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
That's a tough choice.
You mean... the laboratory??
Fron kon steen!
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Vermicelli.
No, Fred ereck.
I'm sure we will.
There wolf!  There castle!
Fro-derick!
But what you were doing?
Did you hear that strange music??
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
How's it going?
Can you play it?
Thanks...for all your help.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Get the sedative ready!
What's that tune that you're playing
Extremely well.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Oh, doctor!
And look at this, Doctor!
Right here?
Reputation.  Reputation!
It wasn't me.
What are you going to do?
Not fooling around.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I will.
MMMMmmmmm!
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
No, not sound.
Look how far we've come.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
How long is it so far?
Three minutes to go!
Yes, sir, name, please?
Food!
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Stuart?
Yes.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
